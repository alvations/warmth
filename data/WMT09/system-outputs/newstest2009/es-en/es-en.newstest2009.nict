Baño bloody of American actions 
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the aid plan the financial system to which we should devote 700 billion dollars (almost a 12 billion kronor). 
The legislators, in that way, ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan. 
To Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilise the whole economy. 
On Monday, the American actions bathing bloody and mainly the rate of actions picked the greatest fall in more than 20 years. lived a 
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven per cent. A fall of volume similar recorded for the last time in 1987. 
The rate fell because before being announced but as soon was that the proposal of the assembly not leaving forward, the rate began to fall freely. 
The congress was cut: The US government can inject 700 billion dollars in banking 
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, reached agreement in a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the system of American finances. 
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week. 
The legislators Americans have provoked a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion kronor). 
However, it is not yet won. 
The Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final shape of the law and that it is adopted. 
The plan of aid the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
He said the Sunday to the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for financial services and of Banks of the House. 
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before Wednesday. 
According to the economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first factor psychologically significant for the revival of the financial market. 
Then, however, it will lead to the "disenchantment" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help the market achieved in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made great progress. 
Solucionamos our differing views about the way that must take the package of measures for the stabilization of the market "commented the democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to it, the final vote could still be Sunday. 
Representatives of legislators met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form the Fund of the government. 
This should buy societies which lead to companies and threaten the stability of the whole system hard to mortgage assets are not sold financial financial losses. 
"We are to close the convention on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market. 
It is necessary to continue with the plan of sanitation, but I believe that we are already in this, "said Paulson still. 
A signal to the Asian business 
The global financial crisis deals expressly in the market of actions that fall quickly. 
According to Senator democrat, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible to that Congress finally adopted an agreement this Sunday. Nevada by 
They want to reassure the business of investors to finance the market that these are the that are in the first huso timetable and where the Congress could influence the trade of Monday. already Asia 
For now, however, there is nothing on when will vote both chambers of the American Congress and, even, if not impede at the last moment with some problem. clear with security 
The legislators believe that will be adopted in the next few days. 
The law, however, will suffer a series of changes. 
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by the President George Bush. 
However, the Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its role, which it would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, of recent 350 billion dollars. 
Bush appreciated the advance of meetings 
Furthermore, the President can veto this decision but the Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes. 
Despite these changes are retained the basic idea of the programme that was to gain financial resources for the buyout of bad fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to conclude of pay their mortgages. mortgage securities whose value 
"We have worked everything. 
The House of representatives should be ready to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday ", commented Senator Republican, Judd Gregg. 
The American President Bush is satisfied with the progress of the meetings. 
Its spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that values "the commitment of both sides to stabilise our financial market and protect our economy". 
Operation of the contract protective 
The President of the Senate, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that legislators decided on the responsibility of the money of the programme for the protection of the taxes of taxpayers in their losses, a plan of finances scheduled. aliviadora closure banking Committee 
The new law must also limit the so-called contracts tanks for directors of the programme, and creates a committee that will take control of a Fund participating societies. 
This should lead the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on it and we have made a great step forward in the direction of the convention which will work and which will be effective in the market and for all the Americans', commented Paulson. 
The plan also has to help the owners of homes that have problems with their payments. 
The government would have to agree with the new payments of mortgages buys in order to reduce the burdens monthly payments to deadlines of debtors and enabling that they stay with their homes. 
Marek psychological help: 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that take place but rather difficult. Finance Nation 
"And is why we do not know what mechanism and at what price they will buy the assets problematic. 
This will be decisive for the distribution of the losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week, to the server iHNed.cz. 
Let the plan is now adopted or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant. 
"It is far more important is that, since this week the Congressmen will agree on its support and give it your imprimatur everything before we can. 
This important psychological and agree that reach this approval is, at present, the most important ", insisted Marek. 
Fight armed to hand: the Reproductor of MP3 against the mobile. 
I advise as choose 
While that almost all mobile reproduces archives of MP3, no MP3 players manages to so-called reproductive. 
What seems clear that it is better to buy only the telephone. 
Yet there are sufficient grounds for the man acquires reproductive only. 
The choice depends almost in the way of their use and the requirement of the future owner. 
Probably it will be difficult to acquire the tocadiscos more modern to listen in it the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Furthermore this type of the records of LP no longer go, and in terms of its quality there is not a single objective reason to continue comprándolos. are musical products 
If amassed on their shelves records chloride, it will probably be dreaming, at least, with this kind of tocadiscos blues or article music with rock, jazz. 
This is the same with the music that is under way, that is, the music comprimida, simplified - music in MP3. 
And here there are categories of price and quality. 
For some can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand money in the same as for a lover of Pink hardly probably helmets of bazaar of twenty money. Floyd reproductive a 
Two extremes, between whom there sufficient room for each. 
The choice is wide. 
We also decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the best players get much more than just reproduce music and even what even the majority of the mobile. 
No current apparatus is universal such as the telephone. 
Faced with the most basic functions as telephone, send messages, can reproduce music and video, recording the two, has a better or worse apparatus of photograph and until can achieve navigate. 
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDA will have in their pocket also a small computer. 
This is a small miracle because no refrigerator knows make a parrillada and no television can state. 
The universality mobile brings us also disadvantages. 
The more functions used in the mobile are light up the indicator of the screen asking be stretched before. 
And the reproduction of music is one of the greatest tragones of energy. 
Few are the most ten or twelve hours, the majority much less mobile who manage to reproduce music. 
In this sense, the breeders of music (especially the most simple) have clearly better performance. 
Therefore, bear in mind that the cheap mobile does not start quarrelling again more than two hours. 
If, in addition to this, constantly call for more security, a freighter for work - this is also valid for appliances more expensive. consíganse, still, 
With the MP3 players this problem will not have, because even the worst will at least 9 hours of functioning uninterrupted after a burden. reproductive 
Another problem is the recording music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately only a part of the equipment has the universal and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software. conector USB 
Of course that is possible recording music directly in the card of memory but only in certain units readers without reduction can connect small used in mobile the memory cards. 
In the breeders, with some exceptions (iPod), it is not necessary to any special software. 
Suffice to fill the apparatus with music USB through the computer. 
The majority of mobile and breeders create alone their order in the library, the name of the interpreter, title of album, gender or also according to the assessment of user. musical according 
Some appliances only show a here with structure of tree similar to a Buscador of Windows and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, telephones intelligent with operating system). 
The reproductive tries to serve, the mobile knows more 
To the choice of a team particular interests by the resistance of accumulator, by the ability of memory, for the quality and the type of departure of sound and, of course, by the comfort of their management. 
If listens, above all, music as substance and will listen to each day only a while, as in the trams, then it is not enough to any mobile than reproduced. 
What virtually truly succeed in any mobile. 
We must not even interested the format in which the mobile reproductive or reproduce music. 
The MP3 it all, and practically, almost the entire music that will be in this form. 
It is among the most widespread and exceptuándole him the absolute majority of the equipment replicate music in WMA format. 
The least include the format PCA (format used by the company Apple and its iPod). 
The best make also, for example, the purchase of online music mobile. 
Just by means of the Internet in the competent pages of operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album mobile visit. 
This service could be alone a weighty argument to acquire a mobile to music. 
Unfortunately the supply of operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the issues of success fleeting of the radio. 
Prices nor are the lowest. 
However, in general, is supposed to precisely this way of sale of music (either by GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will dominate the music industry. 
The majority of the people is always a mobile. 
Whenever likes to hear something, will find the mobile in its pocket, while the MP3 players will be forgotten reproductive at home. 
However, still depends on whether a few headphones or, at least, the handsfree always brings with it. 
If not, can use reproductive an integrated that has virtually every even as a minimum reproductive a mobile MP3 players. 
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the mobile with music will be its price. 
The cheaper cost normally less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand money can already acquire a good walkman. 
In the majority of you will limit the absence of a entry for classic headphones. 
The best, even in regard to the technical part, as the telephones equipped with an entry of 3.5 mms for a classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing other than easy service. 
The simplest - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the really any person. handles players 
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous cassettes currents or even the tocadiscos is obvious. 
It represents a threat in the sense that by mistake and, consequently, huge account by lowering of mobile Internet connected us with the data. 
For what apparatus decide 
Even the cheaper (for example, the Vodafone 527) have generally a slot to change the card of memory (type Ì2 micro, etc.). SD mobile 
Even with the purchase of a proper card will come to the two thousand money. 
However, be careful. 
The basic models, usually are equipped with only a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If already has a mobile and wants to buy cheap reproductive still a MP3 players, takes a look at Cowon, Creation, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) does not lack spent more of 1.1 money. 
If one considers among the most demanding lovers of music takes hand of the móviles-walkman specialist more Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). (Sony, 
These appliances have independent keys to MP3 what is a service as comfortable as a reproductive same. 
The more mobile, whose line have almost identical use as an independent MP3 of specialized all is Sony, Ericsson walkman reproductive. 
The same service and the same category in terms of price, on the four thousand money, but with a greater capacity of memory (until 16 GB) and of accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of hours to 35), the most arria MP3 players such marks brings them. 
The first virtual operator is going to come, this year, to the Czech Republic already. 
Probably 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all services as its partners of Western Europe. 
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would oblige those to be cheaper. 
Probably will not be long in coming. 
Let the operators Czechs are part of the highest in Europe, we have already written in mobil.cz. 
The rest confirmed also the Office of the Czech Telecommunication warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is the most expensive throughout the Union. ČTÚ) ( 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges is probable a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the mobile operators Czechs SMS to send from abroad cheaper that if the sent from home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack competition that really wants to fight. 
This probably we seem paradoxical, since we have three networks of mobile and its high coverage is of more than 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators to love complaining that in the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
This also the chairman of the Council of the Office of Czech Telecommunications, already expressed that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic to any other operator. (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák 
It is perhaps true that for a classic with their own network will not be too many opportunities for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any often). (already operator 
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator. 
Precisely the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a prominent drop in prices to which had to react also traditional operators. 
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile the market of Britain heard voices similar both apart as here. 
It showed that there is room for this kind of operators and that can succeed. 
Moreover, there is no need to seek examples too far. 
In February this year I reported on the release of virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country. 
Moreover, after Mobilking is the group Penta that, apart from this, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of concentrating on many more specific target groups. 
Furthermore, in order to function effectively, is enough with many fewer customers that a classic operator. 
We have relatively large expenditure in construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world this sort of virtual operator normally emerge with low expenditure - offer calls and SMS messages of cheap that however, often contrasts with the supply of services more tight. 
Thus, for example, mobile Tesco in Britain at least half of cheap with regard to competition SMS offers. 
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a good blow also opt for a nothing trivial target group. 
This operator is addressed specifically to man. 
"The man correct chooses Mobilking - is the operator who like and who can be trusted", says, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator Seibert David. 
It is difficult to say if similar concept such as Poland could thus in our country. 
In this doubt the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments in which are based the majority of virtual operators. 
Apart from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic no possibilities, say mobile operators 
However, it seems almost sure that if in the Czech Republic will have some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking. 
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. does not seem too hopeful. 
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region, "said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, financial group's spokesman Penta. 
Indirectly ensured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not submit to this idea. 
Quite the contrary, try to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition. 
Interest on the launch of a virtual operator mobile of which I would like to take a further step forward to become a real competition in the field of customers of companies. O2 Telefónica it already shows the group GTS Novera 
"We have a great interest in this, in order to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also of mobile telephony. 
And how much earlier, better. 
With this possibility we have repeatedly found with all operators Czechs of mobile telephony. 
With some of them have managed to make progress in the meetings, "said the spokesman of the Group, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps flash by better times. 
It appears that, by information unofficial, the first official operator should arrive possibly already at the end of the year. 
But for now its emergence is accompanied by a wall impenetrable of silence. 
"In now believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market in comparison with other is a market very specific. 
Until the present nobody has turned to us with some complex project and serious in this area ", expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman of Telefónica O2. 
In the specificity of Czech market relate other operators. 
The spokesman of T-mobile, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To today have not been no commercial project, bilaterally good, can continue to develop." viable exceptional Kemrová Martina, 
And he adds: "In the network of German operator T-Mobile presenting its mobile will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year. 
At this moment we should already have on the table some specific contract that possible study in so short horizon " 
Vodafone directing their attention more to compliance with the requirements of a license 3G. 
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to the negotiations with virtual operators, and this in regard to the division of expenditure and potential infrastructure. 
Precisely what we regard as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a network for a shared Internet quickly in the mobile. " 
offices responsible - with the operators breakneck speed and meat 
The progress of mobile operators can easily be understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition leading to lower prices and with this, a decrease of profits. 
Then Why facilitating entry to competition? 
When the operators want to achieve something, are able to throw a concert, proof of this is the agarrón when arose U: fon. 
Perhaps the greatest pressure ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U: fon by society German operator T-Mobile presenting its mobile. 
What is testimony to the public information available on the web pages of the ČTÚ. 
But precisely now U: why not accept a virtual operator fon serves as an argument. 
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was open to a fourth operator. 
As regards the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is natural that the entry of another player in the market would mean for him and, above all, for their services large requirements. " 
That is why this access to mobile operators is extremely disappointing due to the total lack of interest Czech regulatory body. 
It is not just a question of the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence in intervening in the commercial tender, unlike Britain and other developed countries. 
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Licitaciones Commercial (ÚOHS). 
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue. 
"The entry of a virtual operator the mobile phone market would be possible after ending a convention on rent the necessary infrastructure between an operator of mobile telephony and a virtual operator. 
Until today no convention has been closed because the supply of the potential was not sufficiently interesting to operators classics ", added to our question Kristián Chalupa, the department of external ÚOHS. External interested rather 
These made statements not surprised to representatives of the operators. 
To offices that must represent the interests of consumers is something more than a consideration, apart from this must observe that nobody should seize their position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the virtual operators normality can see that their entry into the market contributed to the reduction of prices of mobile telephony services" operate with overseas where 
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the means of the market and the reduction of prices do not fall within the interest of the ÚOHS. 
We really do dramatically shocking in this case is the reactions that are of the three dissonant mobile operators. 
The question of whether this is actually a coincidence, it provides for itself. 
It is the same as with the price of petrol in Sundays because it is clear that it is the work of the accident and a hard fight by competition. 
"The Office in this respect has found no signs of unfair competition and is therefore reasons for somehow intervene. 
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in its actions in the market. 
The tools necessary to open the mobile phone market operators, rather, is lacking, as well as the regulators of telecommunication ", added to your response Chalupa virtual. 
The interpretation on the dominant position in the market is one of the many contentious points. 
Obviously, there is an analysis of relevant markets produced by the ČTÚ whereby telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender, a single market. 
In this kind of market of course none of operators Czechs has a dominant position. 
But some of the legal experts offer another vision - to establish a virtual operator is always necessary to the agreement with the administrator of the network. 
And the operator of mobile telephony - with all its logic - has the monopoly of their network. 
Therefore, in a specific segment must necessarily be dominant. 
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should represent a warning the fact that three operators of mobile similarly conspicuously amount. 
The current complaints of stakeholders (a) show that in all negotiations with the operators are clash with many impediments similarities. Novera GTS society inluida 
Taking responsibility in the ČTÚ is a trick quite common in the telecommunications field of which the ÚOHS is washing his hands in all this. 
We have found him because in some cases similar. 
Unfortunately recently was tabled a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for enlargement of the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenders was not even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve. Indeed, 
This must know perfectly the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere. 
Everything is going well, when one looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues to operate something like an operator pseudo-virtual that in mobile networks, there are already a few Czech. 
These companies put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public. 
Normally it is companies that are dedicated to multi-level marketing. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other offer their own mobile phone services. 
Normally only some elected get the list of prices of these companies. 
The magic is that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic customer business for the same putting a large amount of SIM cards. 
As special customer receive after special prices and other offers. 
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all operators Czechs of mobile telephony prohibit this type of resale. 
"If were found cases such as those that could be talk of infringement in the conditions of contract that could result in the end of collaboration with society, replied to the question on this problem. Martina Kemrová given" quotes 
But it is highly unlikely that an activity of this kind on the part of the mobile phone operators were to fail responsible people. 
Precisely in the case of the three companies quoted may be thousands of customers. 
None of the operators is against this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies receive gains despicable and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators in any way threaten their own official marketing - nothing. 
Miroslav Čepický warns us about the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are only used by a negligible percent of customers. 
These, moreover, must accept that the SIM card is not to its name by what cannot have absolutely of him as a normal customer of the operators. "his telephone 
That is precisely what you should appear at the ČTÚ minimally strange. 
Moreover, there is a new question for the ÚOHS. 
If it is that the mobile phone operators entornan the eyes in this type of procedure, why blocking the entry of virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it will not wanting to must not be content with the explanations of the operators that have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it. 
When will continue to be the most expensive 
As was made clear in the text, the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant fall in the prices of services. 
At the same time, in almost all countries where emerged the virtual operator, the traditional operators more or less protected of this outbreak tried. 
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small a market, possibly, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
In the more advanced countries, however, now have spoken the regulatory bodies and in any of the cases defended the operators but their customers. 
It was with formal or informal pressure ensured that the first virtual operator and with him began to emerge other more. measures 
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory all this case what happens as if it were a nail ablaze Body. 
For our experience we cannot leave amazed us that the confusion of powers in these cases suit. 
But we do not desperate. 
If it is that this information is correct, and the virtual operator reaches these lands, then the Czech market mobile telephony probably begin to move again. scenes 
If any of the mobile phone virtual operator will be difficult for the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders. operator leaves enter some 
And we perhaps we draw more expensive than in the rest of Europe.

The South-East wanted to form part of the US in a referendum 
The Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 that Fumaba were part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Biblioteca Southern Bohemia. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this desire went, presumably, some groups of the Sudeten Germans the chairman of the US in 1945. 
It is of the letters that are lying in a particular and which today are sitting in the collection of the Scientific Biblioteca Southern Bohemia archive. 
The Germans of applying in a letter to the American President not allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler in Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia. basis of Krumlov Český 
"We have understood correctly the situation and we really its word that American units are coming to German not as oppressors nor enemies but as liberators" was written in the letter, signed with a "people that leads the fate of Šumava in his heart." land 
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the German national character - a hope only in the brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors are begging in the letter to the American President who assume today and for always to Šumava under a protectorate. Czech presumably means - as they southwest 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we handed to a foreign state that oppressed and rejects minorities and that absolute in working with the victory of the allies', writes in the letter. 
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the "oppressors Czechs". 
If the US president presumably was doubtful about this idea of the Germans, just organize in the land šumavas a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage. šumavos 
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have today of the history of post-war, may sound a little, according to some specialists pint expectations Germans south-eastern then rightly child. 
Although the Germans Czechs should see that there was to discuss its expulsion of the republic only a few admitted this possibility. minimally 
Some waited that the United States and Britain negotiate for the Sudeten some form of autonomy. 
Other believed that remain in Czechoslovakia. 
What confirms even the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice. 
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enrolled marine in the Baltic. 
When at the end of the war as apresaron the British and emplazaron in the field of prisoners steer tens of Germans were to him for which they were taught by Marx Czech. 
"They believed that the return home, Czech would suit," said Chalupa. 
None of the prisoners Germans who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had that on the basis of the Benes decrees would be removed from the Republic. 
There you - you pay! 
Campaign emotional attacking drivers 
The action more expensive in the Czech history to safety on the roads. 
In this way could be characterized the emotional Campaign which decided to launch the Wednesday the Ministry of Transport in the media. 
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises that will dissuade drivers of dangerous behaviour the wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will be felt in the television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures. 
It should discourage the driver of high speed and alcohol at the wheel. 
And also to remind you that before implemented belts are tie. 
It wants to reach the conscience particularly young drivers, riders, pedestrians and finally also of professional drivers. 
And what we see in advertisements? 
Basically human stories that embisten to the emotions. 
And for that we witnessed by advertisements "ruthlessly" throughout the campaign: 
There you - you pay! 
The word "There you" is written with big letters in the registration. 
And in a pond of blood is the word "pay". 
This must symbolize that man in a time of error can come to pay with their lives. 
The announcements will "throw fear" to viewers until 2010. 
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in land, can see images of strong victims of accidents Anglo-Saxon where. 
promise that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths in the Czech roads. 
The announcements have been produced by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Azúcar and stick to drivers 
"To drivers applies the system of sugar and stick. 
Azúcar is for him when, for example, is a red light and saves time. 
The whip is threat of fine or accident. 
In drivers must remember the risks ", says the psychologist transport the hospital Na Homolce, Martin Kořán. 
And this is why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers. 
"If there is some danger probably soon be merged with the environment and the driver would not will pay greater attention," warned Kořán panel installed warning. 
Olmert revive almost all the occupied areas to change of peace 
The chairman of the interim government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, spoke on the restitution of virtually all the occupied lands in the year 1967, i.e., the West Bank and the Golan Heights, to change of peace with Palestinians and Syria, Jerusalem this. 
He proposed in the interview that the Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. 
"We must reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must restore almost all the land (occupied) if not all," said Olmert the daily. necessarily 
"I am sure that we will be left with a percent of these land, but to the Palestinians must cederles a percent similar (of the land of Israel) because without this there will be no peace", added. 
He admitted they in case of restitution would also include Jerusalem this. 
Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want to spend above their legs as happened to one of my best friends, then it will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem ", in reference to the two attacks July in the city in which there were several deaths and dozens of people were injured. He said that tractors or bulldozers" 
According to the president will be necessary to find a solution for the hill sacred and historic "that is within the ancient city of the Temple, place special". 
Anyone who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs. " 
This will not work ", insisted later. 
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights 
Olmert are delivered by the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights what from their point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this would also represent a concrete efforts by Damascus. 
"We propose closing peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan Heights," warned. 
"The Syrians know well what will have to break to win the Golan Heights. 
They must abandon its current relations with Iran, must abandon its relations with the Hezbollah (movement, must emerge from the permanent support that causes terrorism of Hamas and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq ", led the prime minister. Al-Qaeda), (the terrorist network) (movement chita chita) 
Questions after the accident: Are illegal the hostesses in buses? 
The law is unknown, cannot walk in a long-distance bus 
In relation to the tragic accident of bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova the question for us is whether the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus during the journey. 
"If we strict and formally comply with the law, the activity of the flight attendant opposes the law of road transit", says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which died last week the flight attendant twenty-two years, obviously was caused by the driver of truck only sat in the way the bus. 
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in place less sure of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places. 
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment that the azafato distributes coffee or newspapers. 
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is endowed, according to the permission technical, with ordinary places. 
If the bus is not harmonized, the passenger must be granted. 
The buses long distances of Student Agency does not have to go up, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz. sites 
"We have resolved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed. 
Finally it withdrew and come to the agreement that passengers can go to bathing still the bus in motion if we possess seat ", we commented its position. 
The flight attendant knows no law 
"There is a legal interpretation clear the role of the flight attendant - no legal provision clarifying this role. 
Not even any legal provision prohibits the agents of transport do some service. 
The law of road transport only knows the term of Revisor of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined ", adds, less strongly, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The Director of the department of road vehicles Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, that the law being sufficiently this problem. Pokorný Josef, thinks Traffic 
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval permitted to have ordinary sites. 
That is all ", says. 
The buses are divided between the urban, where there are to be standing and maximum speed limited, to be standing with greater speed and the long distances to go up, with the greatest permission of speed and with the seats equipped with safety belt. without sites permit inter-urban with sites sites 
As in the plane, says the expert 
The expert in transport, Jaroslav Hořín, does not see major problems with regard to the movement of azafato in the bus. BESIP in Security 
'For the development of the journey not many threat of danger, the situation is comparable with the service in aircraft. 
Even here is the safety of arriving the turbulence and that the flight attendant can strike in the forefront. " 
"But, if the bus stops suddenly obviously that are valid laws physical. 
The same as in a city bus or in the trams. 
The security of the flight attendant must deal with the internal regulation and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is solved without carrier ", says. 
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service 
Student Agency is the only carrier which offers the service of hostesses. 
employ in him to two hundred. 
The director, or after the accident, considers that work risky. 
"But, when we have the impression that the post of flight attendant is risky, then I add. 
The coffee and newspapers can receive, passengers, to enter. 
It would save even expenditure ", says. 
In the interests of safety is why Asiana lacks hostesses in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which runs a small line in comparison with European Company. 
"We have hostesses, we are against them from the outset. 
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident, "said, less than a year ago, to Týden.cz. 
It happened an enormous tragedy 
In the accident of the line that unites Naples died a young flight attendant of Pilsen a fortnight that had worked for the company two years. 
A truck Slovene that probably revolved since the rut of stationing blocking the step to autobús. without using the fragmented. 
Its driver tried in a rapid manoeuvre avoided, however, clashed with the right way. 
Jančura denies that were sold the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the flight attendant. 
"These sites is not possible wanted to connections long distances, are blocked." 
The company intends to sue the driver of truck. 
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation of the family of the girl but expects the financial costs for the part of the blame. 
Do Reform of the law? 
No, by now 
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the flight attendant in the bus in which from a year ago that are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport. 
"But, have not come to any conclusion specific. 
We are engaged too to buses, but rather the points system, maximum speed in highway and the use of mobile during the march ", says the expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses something that threatens so important passenger safety", ending the spokesman Hanzelka, that control of security in buses is competition of the police and Security Office in the work. 
The hope Dusseldorf supports in Frankfurt 
In the letter of the board of the bank West LB for their collaborators no shortage of big words. 
For the merger of units of the Bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA cannot form a central financial group's of Sparkassen ', as it says the writing, published on Monday capital market 
The bank West LB, breaking the 'bloco of competition' with sustainable profit capacity would such business. 
Moreover, such a merger may be a start to following mergers in the field of regional banks. 
This comes to understand the text, when a directorate wants to show capacity to act in times tough. 
Because as before the West LB is under enormous pressure. 
Not only the part of the European Union, but also of the federal surveillance of financial services that recently has made clear to the government of the North-Rhine Westphalia that is too little time to find a solution. institute 
Since a while ago, also on the part of Frankfurt, we talk a lot about the union of this kind between the bank DEKA, that customers of Sparkasse known for their investment funds, and the West LB. 
In truth, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August left know that sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank, such as the Healed or the West LB. 
But the Board of the DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and associations of Sparkassen, instructed board begin negotiations with the West LB common on the commercial activities. 
In this could be of a business in the capital market or some parts of it. 
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it says in the financial perspective. 
It is not the first time when it comes to the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important employers in the financial site Frankfurt. 
In 2003 at a time the situation seemed so that the bank DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Healed. 
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results. 
Only the plans were made public, the government of Hesse expressed against the participation of Healed in this project. 
The other two banks also not found the same language. 
Instead the bank regional Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank strong winds. 
But it was always again with the idea of merger of the bank DEKA with other regional banks. 
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of the Healed, expressed that was against the plans of the coexistence with his bank. 
Regardless of this seems to be more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary. 
Well, when they go to move the elections of parliament of Bavaria, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank strong winds could make progress. 
For the Healed is therefore not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure continue to increase, it will be the partners to make this Healed to take. 
In the south the bank could be only a partner young, although until now sobresalió much better of the financial crisis that they did the property of Stuttgart and Munich. 
In addition the Sparkassen - and Giroverband, which possesses 85% of the Healed, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. Hesse-Turingia of 
In any case, it is only the Nord LB. 
But such thoughts geo-strategic form are only part. 
In addition it is the compatibility of the different bank models. 
In June Merl made a fundamental question on a trade model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to the Mark Sparkassen- and Giro Verband until now not gave no response. 
In end can be splitting the West LB, but that, of course, is not the desire of the bank. 
Thus, also in the letter of the board of the bank says that it would try to find a comprehensive solution for all the bank 
As we can reconcile the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, this will show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians" 
To Elena is the first time, to Luca the third or fourth already. 
But this time, he attended Elena as his girlfriend, and therefore all seems different, says it. 
Behind them, alongside a barrel of 5 gallons of beer of marks Kaiser is built a huge tiger bear that shows almost 200 participants of Oktoberfest that sounds low knows produce in his throat.

Shifting the night there only mean unnecessary costs Framework, says.

The night buses are already on the road in the highway with the direction "Brenner" 
There is no beer, still not. 
Soon the calm prevails in the bus, passengers are asleep. 
It is quite well, they will still need the forces.

Finally, when the group of Marco has the arrival of night in the parking alongside the Prado of Theresa, there are already 50 other buses throughout Europe. Circa planned to the low-capacity

First: poneros a yellow hat. 
There, of the left is written "Oktoberfest", to hand in letter is page of the travel office in the framework of Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it finished."

"Marchar!" Marchar and sit back sites in the shop of the campaign. 
"I toward front, because we are going to block, and all with the same bench, spread throughout space!" not to sentéis yellow hats websites 
A quarter of beer, roars Framework, costs 8.25 euros. 
We olvidad the tip

That hardly leaves their place, he will be occupied! " 
Third: "This afternoon exactly ten and average you must get here!" Do you really circumvent understood? 
And now all are going to Oktoberfest. 
One, to lead the way, ties the yellow hats in trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of elections of a great People's Party of Bavaria. 
It wishes to acknowledge the way back. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians" 
There are no precise data on the number of people; it is about 50 000 people who make the journey on the Alps and tormentosamente fall in tents, 10% of all came especially this weekend in Italy. 
The police of Munich receives aid of seven policemen of the Province autonomous of voluntary, help the Red Cross of Bavaria that makes a statistic of nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 attendance medical, before the English (around 60 attendance) and the Austrians are first. present Italian Bolzano

The nights without sleep for creditors of the Royal Hypo Estate 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, accentuated only last week the federal minister of finance Peter Steinbrück. 
Let well, that political uses the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field will also be affected trends criticism. 
And this has happened after weekend. 
Hypo Estate (HRE), the property of Munich, who stated in the index DAX has, receives a consortium German banks a loan of billion in order to resistance to the turbulence in the market. financial Royal 
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euro. 
The part of capital that the Hypo Royal Estate will use must shed interest. 
The money comes as of private banks also of those of public law. 
The cause of this is the loss of the subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a report, the state with the money that was given to projects to the long-term financed only a brief period what now, because of the mistrust in the markets, is not more possible. financial 
In the first half of the year the capital reserve has fall in a 95%, 2.37 million euro, also the quota of equity capital held back a bit of a 1.6% to a 1.45 percent. cash bank 
In comparison with the same period last year the continuous income of financial investments and net financial operations, the income of charging for debtors and some titles of values of the dissolution of the business downwards of more than 70%, in 5 million euro. credit constructed provision also to zero fell profit 
Only thanks to the high and many income of reimbursement of expenses of compensation of the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa as well as the reimbursement of interests according to the federal code for companies of the consortium, the negative balance could accuse a deficit with approximately the 16% more tax and business organised. 
After their privatisation in 1990 the former state financial principle was lost in appropriations for the buildings, which served of reason for foundation of the bank Aareal industrial speculation. 
As we could not win much money with the financing of projects, the Defa began to work intensively to the projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and state as well as Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and diversified. state 
Now the Royal Hypo Estate must make repayments on the value of subsidiary that will take a "essential" on account of losses and profits of the group, says very imprecisely consolidated material effect. 
It is a fact that have cancelled dividends. 
As for the year 2007 them were cancelled to two thirds. 
After the acquisition of Depfa the Royal Estate became an important financial and in the field of financial Hypo state infrastructure. 
As the bank has no deposits customer, he, in comparison with other banks, is more dependent on the refinancing participant in the market. 
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the granting of inter-bank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity. 
Each year the Royal Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance part of the Defa of their short-term measures for the refinancing. credit portfolios Hypo 
According to the report, the bank credit the need of the financing of the group for a brief time and the company is insured "the influence of the international money markets are not able to function" now essentially that covers with a Estate Royal Hypo 
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
George Funke, the chairman of the board of the Estate, explained that the Royal Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future. Hypo Royal Hypo 
The German central bank and the monitoring of financial services (BaFin) from the basis that the competitiveness of the Royal Estate Group from now on is ensured. Hypo federal institute 
That must wait shareholders and creditors the bank. 
But because of the dynamics and the imponderables of the crisis there is no evidence. 
Even is conceivable that has not that require funding in its volume completely. 
But it is not the case. 
It was the voice of that in the last hour of Sunday the bank still was almost in insolvency, why the temporary salvation nor can reassure at least people concerned. 
The price of action fell to 75%, 1.30 euros. 
The courses borrowing, on the contrary, they are truly well. 
While the debts do not change, the courses of borrowing according to the position in the registration of property tend clearly downwards. priority almost 
But are especially borrowing of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with the reason borrowing whose debt beyond 2009. 
After the considerable growth in the banking crisis and acquisition of Depfa which affected the current value of its borrowings that were previously an investment for speculation has to be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system. Estate, Royal Hypo 
While the issuing banks, governments and banks are little affected are still ready to support the system, while both can be from the repayment of pensions within the deadline. 
Or will happen something, which risks imagine anyone - the financial crisis will overcome in next 15 months. 
But to see the news on the partial, now the security that is already in its limit became a hope justified. estatización cross 
This will be a reason, because creditors will nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on its isolation of enthusiasm. 
We still short-term investors can put the final point and use the transport to account new losses in tax on the change in the future profit compensation next payments. 
Sylvana and the secret Bent -Box? 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, 16-year-old girl, had to stand in the Highschool of Tachibana girls began to laugh: German The is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges it account Japan. 
"The first day in a school in Japan. 
I was nervous. 
Even before go to school was frightened. 
I live on the brink of Tokyo in the direction Kawasaki and I go in train 40 minutes at the Highschool Tachibana. 
Sola had to find the path, fortunately not I missed. 
It seems that the start of the classes is not set as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony. 
Of the eight of the morning come pupils, the nine less twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the 'all-time room'. 
Before that began the class, I had come to stand. 
Moreover, I am not person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially before a class of 40 pupils. 
As they still have the school uniform I put on a falda the mother of my family host and also a blusa blue shoes, skin black and shoes old. 
Well, I did I tried to make everything in right way: "..." - I call Sylvana, am of Germany and in a week will be my birthday. Sylvana she Wo Sayonara pulpit and the vested 
At this time I was very happy because for two years had begun to study this language. 
All have cuchicheado features and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii" laughed, and done in a class girls 31 
We already knew of my Mangas. 
This belongs to the vocabulary of survival of girls Japanese and means "mona, borders" 
Then I de-lice rapidly in my place. 
The girl had a smile large, for it was an honour that the girl of exchange had to sit alongside it. alongside 
The rest of the kind was quite calmly, but when rang the gong, I felt of truth mugged. 
All spoke at the same time, reían and made many questions at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
Then in the enjoyment all brought their Bentos. 
The mother of my family host was also a Lanchbox for my - is something other than boring pieces of bread Germans. 
He was rice with small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. herbs, 
In most cases, I have no idea what as here in Japan. 
Things are rare and have a taste new. 
What is certain is that everything is very rich. 
Well, perhaps with the exception of plum marinadas in salt, bufff! 
In schools are not simply a Japanese the bentos lunch. 
It sometimes happens that a girl prepares a bento done in way for a boy and we hope to see them better during a recreation. on artistic very 
On that I read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am very curious to see if I can also see that here. 
"Why precisely Japan?", I have asked my friends when I said that I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year school. 
Then always responded: 
"Well, because I marvel." 
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas. 
In order to understand better the comics and culture, a day I began to look a little Language. 
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I will travel there. 
We also because I have a disservice by tradition and habits. 
Here they have a great value. 
In a part Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, another part is a country harsh, disciplined and traditional. 
As all is well organised, I was not yet lost here although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen in my life. " 
We also the rats have feelings 
It says that a rat or a cucaracha feeling the danger is fleeing, why has also fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, scientific in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals are also feelings. 
How can it be controlled if them, behaving in the way similar to us, feel the same? 
In a magazine of the Internet so-called "Edge" from many years are published the contributions of scientists famous. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series responses elected to the question What does You what is truth without power test it? 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of conscience without that I or someone else could prove until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have conscience. 
But in this case at least we can expect because all human brains are the same fundamental shape. 
But as soon as we devote to other species and include the questions about the sense and in general on the conscience, we are entering the area unknown because the hardware does not coincide. 
When a rat is in danger, does the same as other animals: the dead, fleeing or attacks. 
The people behave in a way, of what some scientists are conclusions on comparable experience subjective. 
Of course I do not. 
Two aspects of the brain structure are difficult infecting our experience of subjective animals. 
First, almost always circuits associated by human consciousness of the lóbulo side of the brain (through their participation in the memory short and in the executive functions that direct conduct). prefrontal cortex they include 
This part wide is much more developed in the case of people that the other primates and it seems that lack absolutely in other creatures. 
Bearing in mind at least the aspects relating to our awareness that depends on the lóbulo prefrontal of the brain, including knowledge about who we are and the skill of planning and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even the man differs from the other primates. cortex 
One other particularity is in the nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the language, often that means that the conscience depends on it. linguistic 
In this case cannot exclude animals. 
But even when the conscience not would depend on the language, so that the conscience of animals, created whatever else it wants, in many cases would differ from the majority of our states of conscience. impact 
It is therefore difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals. 
If that, as something interesting and subjective, nor is left measure because it has the special hardware, or leaves analyse through our experiences, its research presents problems large. 
The majority of my speeches relates to the content of the experience condoned, but at the same time there is also a another aspect of the conscience that should be easier for research scientists. 
It could investigate the processes of conscience of animals without taking account of its content, and that is what happens during the studies of memory short of primates, especially in the example of the implementation. 
But with this approach that were still Christof Koch and Francis Crick what is essential is rather at the correlates neutral awareness that the causal mechanisms: The two may be subject or not. 
Curiously this approach highlights the importance of lóbulo prefrontal of the brain cortex for the training of the implementation. 
And what is that for sensations? 
I must the fact that in the system is active part of the brain that is responsible for this, what happens with fear. emotional 
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a defence system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body). space 
Seen from this point of view the feelings are very set to part of the brain what distinguishes primates and especially to man. cortex 
In view of the nature of the fine feeling because we cannot distinguish and classifying the states with the help of the words and the grammar to describe the states of others to couple of ourselves. still rankings linguistic 
For example, on the contrary, thinks that feelings stem from the activities of the parties of the cortex responsible for the feelings and the syllabus of brain, the same thinks, but concentrates more on the syllabus brain. Pankseep Jaak corporal brain simple Antonio Damascus 
As this network has not changed much during the human development can refer absolutely at different rates and their experiences. 
For reasons theoretic cannot go against that, but what I consider not likely. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that sits in two cases also: But how can be controlled if rats and men doing such a feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a cucaracha flee, because it is afraid? 
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behaviour does not yet test similarity of experience. 
That is true that the comparison neural aid: rats and men have similar, the cucarachas on the contrary have at least a brain head-skidding of brain. 
Is the syllabus brain which is responsible for sensations? 
Even when possible test it for men: How can be applied in the event of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cucarachas (who knows?), have sensations. 
But I do not know how can prove it. 
I prefer to investigate behaviour emotional because their sensations differ fundamentally of us (because human consciousness concerns special circuits and the language). supposedly emotional of rats that sensations 
In any case we expect progress in the field of neurology in both that is measured the same rats and of men. 
As no investigo the language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist. 
We can say that I cannot see beyond my nose, but I prefer to go to work permanent without results. 
Well, I am emocionalista practical.

The experts fear that the Theory of the Relativity of Albert Einstein cannot be so correct. 
The space test Ulysses "happened almost 18 years flying in the universe." 
Because of that the pipes of fuel are now threatened a death in the cold. helándose 
For years a phenomenon mysterious, the anomaly during the gravity of the manoeuvre, causes confusion among researchers assistance. 
The gravity of the life of the space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using energy of the field of gravity of a planet Earth, for example, is a manoeuvre assistance. 
This allows the space probes save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens test, the EU-USA used this trick physical as well as did the test of the sun, Ulysses space. 
But what surprise to researchers for many years: The missiles not behave by 100% as well as we expected according to the venerable law of gravitación. 
Rather frequent irregularities of speed. 
Quite suddenly the probes has more or less speed. 
The Physicists could not explain this effect until now. 
What drew anomaly during the assistance of gravity to manoeuvre. 
Some experts fear that possibly even describes the force of attraction of the area by the shape of space cannot be so correct. Relativity of Albert Einstein that general Theory 
Stephen Adler, the US of the Institute for advanced crash formally now as before Einstein confused and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravity with the help of so-called field, in what were the astronomers in the universe. Oscura assistance does not create Study physical 
"The reason the anomaly can be the EU which can also be very close to the Earth ', writes him. Oscura 
Researchers of the universe know the existence of the EU Oscura only from ten years. 
Presumably it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed in other planets. 
The EU Oscura, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that not sends and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no light visible. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the field Oscura makes at least a fifth of the total volume of the universe.

The debate on the bilingual: immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi argue the positions of the candidates on the bilingual education. 
Lance in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of books "Not as good as you Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice." associated, an old Izumi T. 
Calling effectively Hispanic voters is a business difficult. 
The proposals on education made by Barack Obama are the example of this. 
The campaign of Mr Obama notes that "the afro-americanos and students have significantly less likely that students white," and this is something very some Latin graded. 
To combat such differences in the events of learning, the plan of education of Obama specifically calls, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" to the alumnos-Inglés. 
However, the question is whether the compromise of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in different languages of the English, is effective in bridging the gap in the final results. open to Mr Obama 
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep officially recognized in the eastern region, a primary school County Los Angeles. 
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low incomes: 
over a third of students, many of whom newcomers, are learning the language English. 
However, an incredible 100% of students of the fourth year, has been positively assessed in the examination of mathematics 2008 
and almost an equally astonishing 93% has dominated the test of language English and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved using an ingredient different what favoured by Mr Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasizes the review and practice, the ongoing evaluation of the competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
Furthermore, and this is where Mr Obama should take note, agree with the Sixth Calle, the approach of the school for education to students is in the "immersion total." strongly of the primary Mikels Linda 
Immersion in English, means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the content of the investigation. 
The Commissioner Mikels, which opposes the bilingual education, I said, "we had extraordinary successes with students as the latter that has come from Mexico and that, if in the classroom 12 months later not series capable of gathering what was." between 
"It works," said, "we believe that works." 
Will Mr Obama a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model of replies by other schools with large populations of pupils hispanos-inglés? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of politicians of his party on the matter of education (partnerships have been for a long time defenders of bilingual education and its same constant support for bilingual education prediction of the response of Mr Obama. dark) National Education 
While it is that immigrants should learn English recently Mr Obama has dismissed the issue leaving that people should stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English, 
and instead, said, "you must ensure that their child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, should carefully consider the models of education that work well, more than depreciate or trivialising. 
The oil price falls sharply after the renewed economic fears 
The price of oil fell dramatically this Monday because of the concern that the American plan for the financial markets may not be able to rescue revive the economy.

Secondly quarter of madness: team establishes record 
Having past, during the last eight seasons, more time that nobody in the uniform Jets, playing on defence, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen everything. 
Then he saw as things develop in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a party without entry in a game of desinflarse. 
"I have never seen anything like that," commented Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the grim of the clouds. 
In this time happened that the Coles making a target of 12 yard and suggesting the harbinger perfect for a late, in that the evolution of relationship between the players took a great leap forward. Laveranues found Favre Brett quarterback 
Favre found Coles for two goals more in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in half. 
"I do not I left my way," said of all the steps that were to Coles Favre. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been large, regardless of what people may think. " 
While Favre and Coles were carried out in the dam, the defence of the Cardinals maltreated to the quarterback Mr Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle New Revis shot andante and returned 32 yard for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another happens and New. 
Linebacker David Bowens was obliged to lack by Warner. 
In the last turnover, the faults forced by Bowens, could have been the best. 
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after that the Jets recovered the ball, Jay provided a kick 20 yard to win a definitive 34-0 Feely him. 
These are the points higher than the Jets never did in a quarter. 
In The coach, preguntadle described the madness of this moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?" team, Eric Mangini 
When you replied both in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I caught much more the second quarter that the terzero - the Jets enabled 21 points without response. 
They have gained a lot of points in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie rested tops its world record 
Once again, because many I consider the largest corridor of history, overcoming their own world record in the Berlin deviniendo the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. this Sunday and Ethiopia has shown Gebrselassie Haile marathon 
Following the victory in the acomodadiza career in plain in 2: destroyed by 27 seconds its previous record of 2: 04: 26, obtained last year in Berlin. Gebrselassie 59, 0.03: 
In the age of 35 years, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in a career of a case that has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, since the race against time until the marathon. impressive length 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in hindsight - that air pollution aggravate their problems with asthma. 
Instead, it pointed to run in Berlin. 
In almost perfect - the sun and with 48 degrees to begin the race, 55 degrees in the end - Gebrselassie won this Domingo, using in average a rough 4 minutes 43 seconds for mile. conditions 
Since when have become long distances, the record of the marathon has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05 in 1998. Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya corridors of clue as 
After the victory of last Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters who had suffered cramps in the pantorrilla two weeks before and who had lost a week of training. 
It is obvious that the suspension fresh allowed corroded, not. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"All was perfect. 
I began again a week ago, and today teñí some doubts, but in the end all was well. " 
The athlete has been the object of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the afro-oriental of Ethiopia - for the style orchestrating their careers, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of global marathon, based on the pacemaker as if it were a trail of race, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition. too rival 
But this criticism is not diminishing the greatness of the skills of Gebrselassie as corridor. 
This Sunday, to the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1: 02: 04. 
Two corridors of elite in Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to defy Gebrselassie after its pacemaker decreased. 
But little before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie removed a final impetus to be separated from Kwambai, who ended second in 2: 05: 36, improving their best record staff for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi came to third place in 2: 07: 48. 
In the race native Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a year remarkable gaining in 2: 19: 19, the seventh time faster in history. Irina Mikitenko, female 
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
The spring, Mikitenko, 36 years, was a surprise and won the Marathon of London in 2: 24: 14. 
She also took part in the Beijing Games by what was described as a injury in the back, but recovered to win in Berlin and establish its staff best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon which. 
He made a race of calculation intelligent, leaving a quartet of corridors, and then, recovering after 18 ½ miles Ethiopian Kenyans and of making head. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second square in 2: 21,31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya ended third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city apart, the pride and evidence of the life of colour 
Ocultada by the expansion of cars to issue of a few kilometres of the brilliant, noisy colossal city, is a calm, where the pride and the complications of experience African-American are very obvious. people's large and 
Eatonville, the first black incorporated in the country and place of children, because it is not as simple as she described in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 men of colour, 300 good bathing, many guayabas, two schools and nor a prison." Hurston Neale Zora city completely inhabited by 
Now is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Zora to tax tribute to the most famous writer, the Renaissance of Harlem. Hurston Eatonville fair in annual! 
And, however, in many ways, the city that she described - making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the guide of journeys of Florida produced by the Draft the Writers Federal season depression - remains a place apart. 
The city is independent, dignified and private as it was in the years ‘ 30, when she wrote that the rural resistiva to share their real ideas with white man, that "knows little about us and that does not know which is losing." black in Florida often Hurston 
Even now, in the year in which a presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the matter of race, many remain cautious in against the stranger. black 
"We are very cautious about the way in which account our history," said, 59 years, a resident of life and member of the Church of the city. Hortense Jones 
"You must be correct." 
Eatonville since has always been defined a paradox of triumph and fight. 
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of the black and a community of almost 2400 people who live under a level of poverty double the national average. 
It is a centre, but also an example of the southern - sometimes overlooked, other praised - which was born of slavery in America. black rural culture overlooked literary 
It is no wonder, if those living here are both proud and reserved. 
In And concern for the image of Eatonville really started by Zora, as nobody here called Commissioner Hurston. 
She introduced his home town the world through its profound books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide the Florida transformed the city, barely outside the map 17, a road that runs through the heart of the Florida often forgotten inward the history of the black and the human tragedy. 
Taking side of cement in both the life terms in literature, Commissioner Hurston led to its readers to the shop of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in private more areas. 
"Outside the road to left hand," wrote, "there is the public school finished with their white, its well cared jardinos and backyards of game, care for Howard Miller, as he can scarcely read and write." marón modern 
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells all kinds of drinks and anyone else is going with transitional rooms." 
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Commissioner Hurston puts in connection with the government, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. Eatonville autonomous 
Obviously, this Fodor did not. 
Indeed, not everyone was very much appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described it as such outside," said, 90 years, one of the immortalized quoting men who were sing songs without colour about their beauty. Hurston girls Johnson Dinkins She 
It added: "Some people not like that. ' 
The Commissioner Hurston is even remembered here as a eccentric alive often after his family moved into Jacksonville in Florida returned. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, recalls that when the city, was without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and carrying pants in a city that even today is proud of clothing with dignity. Hurston came at 
The majority of the residents were fascinated, said Mr Franklin, while many snidely reían. 
"The people are always alegraba much to see Zora," remains Mr Franklin. 
But, in addition, balanceándose in your chair in a backyard with view on Lake Sabelia, where the Hurston was probably christened, "it ever remained too long." 
When the Commissioner Hurston died in 1960, was poor and their books were no longer in estampación. 
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although was a star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of colour in the Barnard College in the years ‘ 20, was buried in a graveyard anonymous in Fortress Pierce - Florida, where it had been living. literary 
In Eatonville, there was no great ceremonies memorial, or large public readings. 
"I do not believe that their contribution to the world or its legacy were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of the Hurston published in 2003. 
A true turning point came in the ‘ 80. 
The officials of the county of Orange wanted to put a road of five lanes through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the streets of two main lanes labour community. 
The expansion of the area of had already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city's. 
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, ended him relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the ‘ 50, the fight by racial mixing led hatred about the community. 
"For this season, a group of white, were for the city throwing oranges and each thing against people who were sitting at hand," said Mr Franklin. boys 
"Too also to a girl, once. 
I launched against a car sandy. " 
In a letter of 1955 the Commissioner Hurston wrote in the newspaper The's criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honour my race." Sentinel, 
R Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined confidence of their young people. 
"The black children were used to be abrazados - used embrace Professor morning and evening," said, the daughter of She Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization. Nathiri N.Y. - I agreement of this 
This lasted, added, until that teachers and students not member came from the same place. 
"I was not going to espouse your Professor because éra - there is a gap there," said the white cultural Nathiri. 
The civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora, writers and artists who spent above prejudices, as it did it, with confidence and lines as: "How can any deny itself the pleasure of my company! vibrant, black, players Hurstons Neale 
We understand this. " 
In 1975, the writer was to the grave of Hurston and began to fight to resurrect his reputation. Alice Walker anonymous 
Five years later, a hailed biography of the Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookshops, reintroducing in the American fees. 
The draft road came just at the time when the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the spotlight. 
And this time, the old neighbours of the Hurston the saw as a haven. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair for the Hurston to show what the county could ruin with this road. 
Thousands of admirers came to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many returned to the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal of road. 
"The idea revived the road to five avenues, would have been put in what you would call speed of shape, a real civic pride," said the Nathiri. 
The Commissioner told Boyd more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory on the draft of the road has helped to change the image of the city. 
People outside Munson, a lawyer that began to come to church of here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past. Rachelle city as 
Eatonville entered into the National Historic register in 1998. 
A new library (carrying the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: to only six miles from the centre of can sometimes sentirte as in a street of past under a hail of summer, in a city as small as that was founded by only 27 black families in the years 1880. 's 
(The 90% of black people is today.) 
Outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution. 
In A permission in advance is necessary to make the majority of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the former Eatonville, painted white man by a black men working in the field - cannot be their photograph and showing church. 
Many in Eatonville, as Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher that has weakness by red brilliant, still fear that their community island da can be misinterpreted. 
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, has also arisen a higher level of home pride. 
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville at the same way that the whole of their race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also in the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker foolishly and mixed. Hurston saw 
It is a sincere respect what can be heard in the voice of the nephew of 18 years, which goes back to Eatonville after the university to work in local government or by the Department of Police, who said could need something of aid. Edwin Franklin, Mr Harvey, planned civic 
And even those that are more young people, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two twin 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"The majority of people, in the event that dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared with any other', 'says Alondra Kenon after go to church in a recent Sunday. 
"But if you take a moment to look at its history, is a city very pleasant." really stop and

Elizabeth Bayón retains the essence of the dancer sevillana Tórtola Valencia 
One bailaora sevillana will pay homage to a dancer also sevillana. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, my father and mother Andalucian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when had three years moved into London with his family. Florenç (Tórtola Ferrer) 
It was a dance dancer free and specialist in oriental dances. 
He had a fascinating life, a proponent of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of corset preventing the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman who marked a revolution dancística aesthetic and in Europe between wars, fascinated to Elizabeth Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and it I proposed this character and I thought it incredible". 
According to the bailaora, "does not intend to count their lives but collect their spirit. 
The titles of their dances I have suggested sticks Flemish of. 
Thus, "dances butterfly" I suggested a guajira, or "dance the sting" a tangos. 
Its dance was sensual and I have said that my dance is also within this aesthetic ", states. 
The exceptional again in one in their shows, as it did in the "The open door"; and with the teacher Reef who wanted to collaborate with whom outside its student. Matilde: Miguel Poveda that cant with two partnerships assembly Elizabeth exceptionally

"violates Rafa The It violates and Pájaro The and Moi of Morón, the music and guitarras Towers and Paco Arriaga of" 
In the work is somehow the life of this woman that developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, besides throughout Europe, because normally living in London. 
"I wanted to remember it because I think that it is these women have an enormous influence in a particular period and now nobody knows and much less puts in value their work", states Bayón. 
The spectacle will begin today at the 5 hours in the theatre Lope of Vega. 
The publication of the "Official a poet newly married" closes also the Trienio 
The presentation of the first edition in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez entered into marriage, is framed within the planned activities by the Department of Culture of the to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both to commemorate and Juan Ramón "(2006-2008), organised Zenobia Trienio" in March 1916 Zenobia with "Official an enlightened Poeta Reciencasado".

America is like less without raising Paul 
"Sometimes God creates people perfect. 
Paul raising was one of them. " 
The phrase is of the Field, who worked with him in "No", and gives the idea of the distress of American films, and the whole of America, before the striking idea that his gone. mischief Sally actress 
Look that cost them to a Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn from 2007. 
And who knew that he was very ill. 
There has been a blow for all. 
"In times what one feels is beyond any expression, and I now have lost a great friend", cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
Nobody was afraid do the ridiculous or exaggerate. 
There were killed a father of films and the homeland in a particularly obscure, with fear terrorists and markets, with the American soils, desperately searching reasons for dignity self-esteem. 
When so hard is the time and without virtue men and well few remaining need not be Luis Cernuda to love Paul raising, you who admire. 
Encarnaba for all an ideal almost Platonic of beauty and of truth. 
It was formal Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and gained them, since the foundation for combating drugs created in honour of its primogénito died from overdoses until its mark of food home-made organic and. enemy 
All a gift to a country that has cost much shrug off a suicidal food culture. 
The wavelength expansive of the admiration barred Hollywood regardless of nationality or passports. 
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, concluded that has not died a man but an era. 
Another English, the oscarizado director Sam Mendes, said that his work with no more or less than the summit was in his career. 
The bad guy come from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call raising its greater inspiration. 
"We has left the very high standard to all, perhaps one of the few that today dares to try to live as raising: maintaining high the requirement of probity and have a serious and removed from the cameras. private life lived Paul stated George Clooney" 
This is not always easy or even possible in the media jungle today. 
But there is anyone who tries to, and Paul raising is its example. 
It divorced once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, which was faithful when you not harmful opportunities fingers left. 
"But what I shall eat hamburger outside the home, whether within have steak?", used to joke himself. 
In the sky has the pride that in the land their daughters coincide with their called anoraks, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the major roles he interpreted, none was so proud and husband devoutly, father lover, grandfather caring and philanthropist devoted", they say. 
The race imperfect of an Olympic Madrid 
Yes, the dream of many of us is held in Madrid and, after 2012, may be the 2016 Olympics a failed. 
But I wonder, are we prepared? 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday, I say no! 
The race perfect the called, and in my opinion has been the worst race with much in which I have been. 
A height of outrages that, since then, if we bear in mind as evaluation and I examine, would be a hold very clear. 
But we go for parties and from the outset. 
The outrages are beginning with the collection of backbone, you do have to go before. 
This does not seem to me wrong, but if you do go that far den all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race). 
Because not. 
Here you were going to collect the backbone (first compromised, go only to this) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, had only size 'S' for the t-shirt printed (second compromised, because I need a size XL) only 
What world we live? 
Or is that by the crisis have decided to buy only T-shirts small with less fabric and cheaper? 
Well, things as they are peanuts compared with the day of the race. 
Apart from that have to go very soon to collect the chip, the queue to reach is 15 minutes and, furthermore, we should stop anyone. 
More than 35 minutes waiting, something incomprehensible to a race where is expected to more than 11 000 people lasted. 
Then, as expected, began the race and we still had not made the anyone, although once achieved, the collection was worse. 
Moreover, the rain amenizó the hopes of more than 40 minutes, coupled with that of popular revolt and assault on the caseta. 
I believe that some 500 people probably tomorrow we have pulmonía, and some as I, nor even appearing with time correct in the classification, due to the chip to gave me that, I imagine, I am not marked the exit correctly. 
Since then, if I ask for the race perfect, this would not enter into my thoughts. 
So I believe we will dreaming with an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft search while virtual (a) 
In the conference of MIT has shown an advance of a new system of recognition of human and interaction, a kind of great intelligence able to perform some basic tasks, as ask a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move by the company) according to what listens in conversation. campuses but Artificial without Intelligence image Technologies Emergentes Microsoft 
Thanks to a chamber and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "" can know how many people there are in the room, who are - even remember what carried because - and hear and understand the key words of its talks. while 
We also embrace the present according to the groups of conversation. 
In the video shows the detects a third person but understands that does not belong to the group that is talking with it, and that is not an employee of the company. while of 
I question whether it is there to visit someone and he says that he will heed shortly. 
All without pantallazo blue. 
Impresionante. 
But that, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to focus, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has spoken very above a change of strategy on Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more slight and will not have so many programmes associated. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essential instead of loads of basurilla commercial, would go five times faster - man, Steve, because it will be for less. 
All a discovery bearing in mind that Microsoft, version following version, has added functions and "overtime" to Windows. 
The change of direction is appreciated. 
Microsfot is right, operating system is losing importance, and also the software. 
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those that joined the theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not a workable system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential for the Hardware and Filtering understand. 
It meets the same function that his wife or her husband when you have to say something to its meant. 
It is true. 
Never will disappear but must think in the "death" of operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative. 
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser. 
The computer it begins to implement the Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time that in the environment of windows. only 
Why are half the applications that come in the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 must be less, much less, that Viewed. 
Less heavy, less stretched, less complex. 
In Microsoft interested in more integrate their on-line services and finally to be an alternative to Google. 
We desperately need, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
The photograph of this post did in one of the rest rooms for employees of Microsoft, in Redmond, earlier this month. 
In the machine manufacturers a poster asks them to use their tool of search - "Your search. Our future". 
In the year 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek in the network. 
Last week, incidentally, was confirmed also a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
We will come to early 2009 but to the end, rather throwing to 2010. 
In Microsoft certainly sought the launch set of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, is increasingly computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, is going to happen bill.

The drivers repeat offenders by must install 'alcolock' alcohol 
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents kick-start the vehicle drunken or if it is blowing. 
The initiative is already announced last June and now is already included in the annual memory of the Public Prosecutor General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year. 
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so that this will also receive a course of road re-education.

According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more once and for lead ebrios returns to the car.

Its cost is higher than the 1000 euros and would run by account of sanctioned. 
In this sense, a study carried out in US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with these devices reduce until in 65% infringements during the first year of implementation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
The measure sticks to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviour before escalate into criminal offences.

Talk asleep 
Some children speak for the night. 
I am not referring to those that are very espabilados telling us something that has happened the day before, but to children who speak still asleep. reawaken 
The first time that happens as best you take fright, but in reality has no importance. 
It is a benign altering the dream that is called somniloquios. 
It is quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents. 
Surely that more than one would have been told that spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can appear so very sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more every day, once a week, once in meseS...), the next day the child not recalls nothing. periodic ( 
There is a single cause which determine its appearance. 
Often van connected to other changes to the dream as tend to be the nightmares, the night terrors sleeping, but not necessarily be so. sonambulismo) or the night enuresis, the (be pis 
As we have already mentioned earlier can also be linked to pictures of foot very high, to situations of stress or over-excitement. 
It is nonetheless a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable. 
It may be that speaks in a tone of voice calm, words loose, a murmur or otherwise (cries, llantos, long speeches...). 
In cases where the demonstration is very intense should observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there are any issue that is creating great anxiety and gives way out of this way. 
We have said that it is a benign, therefore has no treatment, except that goes associated with another distorts the dream that we can treat (for example, if it is associated with the dream or a picture of stress). apnea altering 
What we cannot do is take account of a number of preventive measures very simple, such as: 
To try not excite much the child before going to sleep. 
Therefore seek games reassured and avoid programmes or television series that are of fear or a little violent. 
With children very nervous and that can be used to help them to acquire a certain technical relaxation costs much relax, internal calm. 
This will encourage the child can have a dream more calm. 
Once the somniloquias intended maintain calm. 
'Remember that are harmless for the child and that the next day not recall nothing of what has happened. 
Councils useful 
It despertéis. 
It is useless, because he is not aware, and I romperéis the dream. 
Although is talking, he is asleep and is therefore descansando. 
'Remember that if is very angustiado during several episodes we should consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child. 
If we understand what he says (that is not the most usual), not caigáis in the temptation to make an interrogation to coax information. 
We conseguiréis nothing, because to be asleep is not aware as to organize its thinking. 
Furthermore you oiréis what he says, but not to say that, with which very careful how interpretáis information and with the conclusions that sacáis all what is dreaming. 
He would digáis the child what you can interrogate evening to know their secret. 
Not even of joke. 
That creates great anxiety. 
In short, Don't worry, is nothing wrong, is an episode which lasts only a few minutes.

Obama could confirm their advantage on Thursday with good provision expected of its member of his same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sara Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to be underestimated. 
It has good instincts ", warned however Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenario McCain revealed its undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the "naïve" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation. 
"The Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." accused in several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be chairman," also assured.

"In Minsk," Do you really circumvent noticed the elections in Minsk? " 
Young and opponents demonstrating last Sunday afternoon in the main square the Belarusian capital to reject with anticipation the results of the legislation. 
Some hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday evening from the closure of the polling stations in the central square in Minsk to protest against the flawed nature of the legislation. 
While no result still had been announced, many young people had come to express against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, has to resign". 
Some recognize not having voted: "for what, as do what they want with my vote", says a young. 
We believe that the regime that set for foreign observers in order to renew the contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change. good 
The sanctions, between the Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections are regarded as fair for observers. which l interdiction of visas for 40 certain 
There were according to the opposition. 
"We have been posts at the side of the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes", regretted the spokesman for the Union of the democratic forces, a twelve parties. heterogeneous reunification, Iouri Potemkine 
"It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the presidential election of 2006 and leader of the movement pro-European, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive. 
If some members of the opposition fall in the parliament, is because you have been appointed but not elected. 
"But its entry into parliament can mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law." 
The opposition must therefore entering the political game because "must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many debts opposite Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent ". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not accept the validity of the vote. 
It stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the spread of vote with anticipation (26% of the electorate in Minsk) led to manipulation. 
"Do you really circumvent noticed the elections? Interrogates Social Democratic leader, one of two recent political prisoners released in August this year. Kozouline Alexandre 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to the parliament, which suits best to power. "

The interview - Yellow returns to be safe 
Héma-Québec held yesterday its 10 ° anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of suppliers more secure and efficient of blood in the world. 
And above all, reconquered it public confidence that had been vacillate by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s seriously. 
As we know, national reserves of blood transfusion administered by the Red Cross have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) and the virus of hepatitis C during the years 1980. Viruses of Canadian Service 
Faced with this tragedy and to the public, the government of Canada did in February 1994 a survey, chaired by the judge, intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such tragedy and make recommendations to that such a disaster not be reproduced more. Krever Horace public discontent 
While the judge in presenting its relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that was intended to plan for a new system of management of the blood in Canada. Krever took 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. 
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada to provide Quebec and Canadian Company blood to supply all the other provinces and both territories. Héma-Québec: 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began their activities, almost 38% of people had still confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public ", says that the principle of 2008, near the 94% of the population quebequesa had henceforth confidence in Héma-Québec proudly claim before. 
The Dr Décary recalls however that "the confidence is something extremely fragile". 
Since its creation, 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, assisted in Europe the birth of numerous cases of human variant of the mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account Décary. 
I do not know whether this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
Then we support in one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, whereby if we do not know and when a serious illness can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterised by a leading inevitably to death, we instituted measures of brain degenerative exclusion. 
In April 1999, because refuse the blood of the people who had remained over a month in the United Kingdom since 1980. 
But, some years ago, has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that applied had the sense. " 
In 1999 appeared in the market a technique much more sensitive HIV: the evidence that can detect directly in the blood of the virus and not antibodies against the virus, in which governed the evidence used hitherto. donors nucleído acid screening 
The evidence of nucleído enabled shorten the period between the time when the person has been infected and when the first virus can be detected in the blood for our technical, explains the specialist. acid 
We reduce this period in less than a week. 
Disminuimos so substantially the risk that certain donors are infected inadvertently and that we cannot detectarles. 
These improvements enabled fall significantly the risk of contracting AIDS by a blood transfusion. 
Today, a person every 12 million runs the risk of receive contaminated blood for HIV. 
"That means that there will be to distribute 12 million blood products before that someone is infected by HIV. 
So as Héma-Québec distributed each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, will be more than 24 years before sobrevenga a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product. 
I believe that can be today receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain the health without concerns ", says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the coming decade is to maintain the security of our products. 
He knows pathogenic which could emerge in the system. 
Last year appeared in the island of Reunion, for example of the West Nile virus of, is conveyed by an insect in blood. Chikungunya the virus 
We must be constantly vigilant ", pursues the addition of a secure supplies, Héma-Québec must also anticipate a sufficient supply Dr Décary before stress that. 
"The needs increase because the population is ageing. 
Since the treatments anti-American carcinogenic more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood of platelets. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of donors of blood that brings together on average only 3% of Quebequeses allowable to blood donation. " 
All people with good health, 18 years and that correspond to the eligibility criteria can however donate blood each 56 days, or is six times a year. 
On average, 14% of the people who are not accepted, because suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if travelled in a country where reigns malaria, will be excluded during a period of one year. proposes their blood 
'With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory covering the needs of hospitals. 
The hardships are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot more donate their blood. 
But it is difficult to convince the people give blood, but especially detaining them and inciting to be regular donor. 
Since the current unbridled, are rarely the time for a time to give blood ", is concerned about Francine Décary is very life. 
With a budget of 297 billion dollars per year, not only blood products, but also human tissues, between those who injertos and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burnt. eye balloons, caused an increase in bone heart valvas, Héma-Québec supplies 
These tissues are analysed, frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec which arranges also the only public bank cord blood in Quebec. processed and 
The umbilical cord blood rich of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer is full of a formerly was viewed as biomedical waste. 
"We have held a few weeks ago, the bank of our thousandth shows cord blood and is expected to make more of a thousand of these per year. 
We should start to propose this for injertos at the beginning of next year ", which describes this programme of decision-making blood of cordon as very popular. Décary Doctora precise 
"Many are disappointed of not being able to enjoy this", since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this programme complex and costly in every hospital in Quebec.;

The prime minister does not exclude of launching elections before the end of the year 
As soon as the Liberal Party was yesterday in Juan-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (of left), seeks to be choose during the election today. partial general advice, Jean Charest, 
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual fall in the broad lines, at the end of the Liberal Party's general advice of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. force " 
Behind it, during his speech, were planned images. 
Desfilaban, in three screens immense, hydroelectric dams, proposed mining, of Quebec seen by "," maps, etc. Maps Google spectacular images of 
Great means as during the electoral period. 
The first minister thinks that the elections this autumn, although did see that its timetable was very full. 
The "" is the fourth side of a 'vision' that the prime minister of a "new economic space ', which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario. Quebec, aims to take for conducting North 
We often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory parallel - never had been the subject of a presentation to 49 °. 
The prime minister was limited however explain why the North was "a jewel the potential immense", but not gave a term, amounts of investment, nor priority needs in future projects. 
What could be more developed are: particularly the hydro-electricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures. on all 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platino, gold, silver, iron, titanium and also diamond", according to the list of Mr Charest. 
This "territory twice large as France", "is home our, is in Quebec. 
Not only is home our, but that is in us ", insisted, as to show that national founder requesting a myth. 
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: the flood towards the gold in Abitibi, engineering quebequesa, the Bay James. 
"We belongs, is our future", added, having made a pause doing to contemplate the map vast behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory Quebecois, comprises part of the Labrador stated Prime Minister during the press conference that Quebec always proclaimed,. 
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated. 
There is a line which will not long ago and, when the time comes, I reiterate the position of part of the government ", indicated border in the agreement. 
Moreover, "with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North", declared talking about the passage of the north-west, launched each year due to the Ice smelting. 
In this new geopolitical context, Prime Minister considers that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the Materials Nations and the Inuites? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit, particularly the young. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the party Quebecois of Ungava), already begun consultations about some thirty communities. 
A ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Resources natural) has an important role began some work. 
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "will be a common vision." 
The development of North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The Plan North "will be concluded, respects the environment", orderly and promised. 
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as one that is in continuity with the prime ministers liberals before it. 
"As liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage party to power. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rename the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adélard-Godbout. 
"The Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, who made the nationalization of hydro-electricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party knew forge the future", declared John Charest. calmly and Revolution in Lesage 
In the press conference, claimed another reference, that conservative, the programme 'Roads to the North "of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister since 1957 until the 1963. 
Tocando the draft dam, Mr Charest stressed that its start-up is scheduled for 2012. Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric of 
"This falls between us, but I foresee be there", entrusted to their militants, causing applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that would have no place elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, not ruled out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, what the law allows him. 
It stresses that its timetable is however full, particularly because of a mission of the advice of the federation in China and a summit Quebec-New York York. 
The general weekend abasteció nationalist, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that were not problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. liberal leader a platform that contained resolutions council 
He also that Quebec behalf to members of the Council of the Canadian and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec telecommunications and broadcasting. 
In the hand of the opposition, greeted the broad lines of Plan North with scepticism. 
The head of the party did highlight the common of development of North of Quebec that the government Landry had launched in 2001. Quebecois, Pauline Marois 
According to it, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, chose to implement it.

The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a Plan North part of the government. 
"But what you want, is that this is not just a spectacle, commented on the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, which returns on holiday today." 
Letras - A country brought disgrace on itself 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of the "Justice" (lo irony!) in the cabinet Harper, allowing last summer say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada. 
Dishonour well this woman who took a relentless fight for justice and which deserves our admiration what says everything about relations of the prime minister and Stephen Harper. 
We are in front of a government that is the only, between all western countries involved, which has not repatriated to their national who is rooted in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
It is a government that does not take account of any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager very young when the facts that are recriminados occurred. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, is denying its promise and leaves live in inhuman conditions a child soldier. 
The only thing that chonta with a false justice to assess the culpability of the accused. 
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of lawyers Canadians, particularly, maintain the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that enjoys the benefit of a fair process in Canada. 
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little cares that a young adults is psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after so many years of levies. 
We still do not realise that, but we are witnessing at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continuing repeat and that makes no sense. 
The time has come, in which there is more: we can mistreat, torture, imprisoning arbitrarily at a Canadian citizen wants the head of government (what will happen after the 14 October?). minority until now and moral any 
Many electors believe that will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, the State Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more. 
Opinion free - The speech Orwellian of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, I Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Following a logic Gold says that the largest in the world tried to a process for defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small house in order to provoke a "public debate transparent." editorial aurífera company Orwellian, Barrick 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, is not the truth that judge, especially in the case of persecution for libel, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely outweighed by Mr Garver. 
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to carry a public debate would harm anyone dares to sustain a position contrary to yours? 
The result of the lawsuit has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada should spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the pockets almost without substance of the mining. 
The tactic, in these fights unequal, is often consists in ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly solution that amordazará addition to frighten whoever will dare to re-examine the issue opposition. 
If Barrick truly wanted a public debate, is ahead of public opinion that would have had to submit their vision of the facts. Gold 
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Gold, debates in Canada are normally by the change of ideas and not to stick. Barrick works 
It was then that opened their books, their dossiers and establish a genuine debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent teams search that could have clarify the issue. mining 
But Barrick Gold seems not to rely on public opinion and rejects the petitions and the letters stronghold to the authors of Noir Canada. 
Do Possibly Mr Garver could explain how can ask for a debate "public" disregarding the views of this? 
According to the vice-president, it seems that this word known only to lawyers very paid and not for all the Canadians; this represents a view very limited the concept. 
In a democracy, the detractors also have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or what does not understand - is that the public that maintains the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so above all because it rejects the mining of brutal way. Barrick Gold 
This is prepared to listen to Barrick and to judge, but taking as civilised arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecución-mordaza (pursuing the "public debate has just put a requirement with regard to the authors of Noir not to use more this word). intimándolos Canada Gold Barrick", based changes public 
In addition to the speech Mr Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of search university and of truth, essential couple all democratic societies. surreal 
Niega the right of quote credible and make a debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work sources. 
If it is impossible to consider and discuss subject that dislike to rich companies of this world in a country such as Canada, under death many persecutions, who can? 
If Barrick Gold truly like a public and transparent debate, could do so following scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It has a right of reply. 
The university world, to which we belong, known for a long time administer the debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what is intended, does not feel like make a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments are devices that limit this kind of proceedings.

"We have a financial problem very serious. 
There are solutions. 
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers'. 
The representative democrat, that is a promoter of a small group in Congress, presents the problems of another way, but comes to the same conclusion. Sherman Brad 
"Cuatrocientos teachers of economy, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us to tell us: we ask the Congress and carefully examine the path to take" no hurry, stated yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, we had again proof of the global nature of the crisis.

In short a citizen model. 
What is what produced in the factory bills Zuschlag & amp; Co.? 
Very soon, on 8 October, will begin the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and their accomplices. 
The political and their accomplices to commit fraud of significant damage, so of business, constantly and in addition to other crimes, between these counterfeit documents. organised way accuses the 
According to the Public Prosecutor used for purposes own funds obtained in public competitions justifying on many occasions fulfilling the tasks with bills false. 
The public funds and the municipalities - in its entirety about 65 million HUF - stop in part in treasury of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal into the pockets of individuals and in part. 
The method, which was published by researchers also, was to justify the recovery of funds obtained in public contracts with bills false behind which had not real implementation, the various associations never met their obligations. 
According to the accusation, the majority of the bills were false. 
For this obtained the talonarios in the market district of Józsefváros and stamps in the city of Kiskunhalas circular were manufactured. 
And the question of that in the name of what company was to make the bill falsified decided among others in that tour of the Region of Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István Lados. 
This last confessed that for this purpose should choose hostales and restaurants. 
He demanded bill for their consumption and these bills that presented the Ministry of Youth and Deportivos, in the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs, as well as in the city of Capital competitions among others used to prepare model Affairs. 
These bills were signed in its majority by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports required to obtain public subsidies. 
During one of their "study" Lados chose a Hamburg. 
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices, this centre food style provided food to a group of 1990s people of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
However - according to the manager of the centre - so many people no place in this place. 
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Foundation Jobb Jövőért - later so-called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal errors and contextual. 
For a hostal the town of Badacsonytomaj had just three rooms and more than ten people could not move there in a night, however in the bill constaban cent and thirty people. 
But the manufacturers of bill of great fantasy also pointed to the Kft. because in the teneduría books of the same - according to the information given to the Public Prosecutor - had not documents to the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá. Pigal food style centre were when 
Győző the manager of that company, I informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and saw the bills, already knew that it was false documents. Farkas 
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in place incorrect." 
This: in addition to the problems that according to the bill housed 100 people, since they have only eleven rooms in which there is not so many people. Nor concordaba formal 
Moreover, in the bill included also meals, while the restaurant long ago that does not work. 
The enthusiastic manufacturers of invoices are not reported either that the travel agency elected in Budapest foreign trips, so that in the bill of cash, which coincided with the practice of issuance of bills of agency. Nor within Hungary as a service a trip indicated foolishly organizes exclusively 
In addition - as is known during the investigation - included in the document VAT also, despite that travel outside the territory of the European Union were exempted from tax. 
Among other things the extent of VAT in the four documents issued by the Hotel for the foundation, since services of that company are not loaded with a but only with 15% of VAT, moreover employees the hotel bills made to machine however the bill was handbook. extending only 25 Jövőért Jobb Kft. Révfülöp was also incorrect 
Furthermore the "shipping agents, as in the case of a company in which set in the bill as activity carried out road transport which is known during the investigations of the prosecutor - not makes the company founded as a consultant investments. -" committed other errors also 
Equally by formal inadequate the bill, is known that are false invoices issued to Együtt to Harmadik 21st, for. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. Alapítvány Évezredért stamp false - differences - format 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Campamento Sports of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused have issued these bills. 
The counterfeiting gave attention to that when the group of Fiatal hence (2001) the HIB was in the process of settlement, why the charge of the process of the settlement - according to our information - negated have issued such document. Kft. of Nyíregyháza comía Egyesület Városért either 
Expidieron consciously invoices 
Another group of manufacturers of invoices false they are composed of those who were aware that they had to issuing bills fictitious. 
The Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - amounting to some four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért. Ifjú Szocialisták, issued bill Alapítvány Budapestért Esély 
At the manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - convinced one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing bills fictitious. 
Similarly was working with Zuschlag and their accomplices the process of settlement, which in 2003 supplied bills for an approximate value of five million HUF to the foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and partnership Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity. Alapítvány Jövőért Jobb, currently under Kft Biogate. 
There was capital movement either, because then they cancelled invoices prepared but forgot to record in its documents to this entity. 
In the next group of manufacturers of bills false include those who have any link with the accused. 
For example Kubatov was the Ukrainian manager of the Delta fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which was concerned with the trade of fuels and vehicles. Trio SL with demandadero of Ivan 
This company issued to a value of approximately 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT resources. HUF numerous bills 
According to data from research these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. that, since 14 September 2005 is under process of settlement. Kiskunhalas of 
The manager of this company was a Romanian who Ivan Kubatov should also documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005 botched. 
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the research that issued on behalf of the company bills for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány gaining the amount himself. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment were founded by albañiles Romanians to express request of Ivan Kubatov Bt.. 
However, none of the companies worked effectively due - according to the accused - that were not work. 
But took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer, who prepared the documents of registration of the company, issued on behalf of societies to organisations linked with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció. bills Szente Zsolt 
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Delta, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave in total 15 different entities by a value of 14,2 million HUF. bills Trio Investment 
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices. 
This man seized even society in comandita Szi-Beri for issuing bills fictitious used in the Biztos Pont. 
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség presented a tender in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (EBA), public utility entity of the Socialist Party. Magyarországért Modern to 
In the tender obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but not used the money for the objectives of the tender. 
For that not discovered, presented the EBA five bills fictitious received of the works Team Kft. 
These were invoices encountered during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the seat of the Ministry of Education. 
Part of the accused probably related in the trial - as they did in the Public Prosecutor - the course of falsified invoices. 
The most interesting can be the confession of own accused main János Zuschlag, if it decides to dismantle all. 
For their confessions until now have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised talk about everything, this has not until the present. 
The question is: what interest has done, because perhaps in exchange for the return of the most money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists came to an agreement with him for that Zusi assume all the responsibilities.? 
Who, moreover, for these days, since to alleviate their prison conditions called house arrest, but I was repeatedly refused until was offended. 
While the many authors of crimes, which never returned the money can expect in their own home the judgment, he has no possibility for that. freely or at least running, higher very economic value 
Psychology of the sobrepuestas: Why spend more money? 
The participants of auctions are prone to spend more money and overstate the product. 
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the foundations neurological economic - this conduct known and apparently irrational. 
According to the study published in the magazine Science, people do not want to lose in powers as the auctioning of eBay therefore prefers to pay even overpriced. 
Scientists tried to establish the scheme neurological of this "stake" at auction experimental. 
One of voluntary groups played lottery, the other participate in an auction while it examined by the system of magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) areas of the brain people participants in the experiment functional active. 
In both games could earn money participants, but during the auctions, where it is essential element invest more than the other, to lose the game intensified the functioning of the complex so-called stratum below the cortex 'brain. 
This area of the brain, as well as many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "car prize" of the nervous system. 
So according to the scientists, the increase of betting explains as a prevention not to provoke a reaction intense of layer. 
To establish his theory, economists of the scientific group also made a study of financial follow-up. 
In this experiment three groups committed against a person in different circumstances. 
At the control group are simply told the real value of the product in question, and their members who bet. 
In another group addition he promised that if they earn, would receive 15 dollars over prize. 
Instead, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in the case of losing the auction members of the group perdían even this money. 
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one highlighting the triumph and for another failure. 
However, the hypothesis of the members of the group that playing, "against the failure" were prepared to invest even more members of the group of control and the group "winner." neurologists, checking 
"These results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory previously. 
For those until now of auctions solely with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks. explicable phenomena 
Only the visual helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that now we reached a third explanation "- faculty of the University of New York. economy, Professor Schotter Andrew established neurological methods 
Hepatitis: When must go to the doctor? 
In the world a few hundred million people suffer from hepatitis B or liver chronic disease is considered one of the main causes of death, and in Hungary chronic C. 
It is estimated at a hundred thousand the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick not know that are infected. 
The designation of hepatitis is the name of common liver different diseases caused by a virus. 
The symptoms are much; are characteristic infection liver disease and the ictericia, but their pathogens and diseases caused are very different. 
The virus spread with two main forms: hepatitis A and E by (for example with water or food contaminate), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with blood and physical (sperm, mood of vaginas, froth.) with popular moods food path pathogen dependence on the hepatitis in 
It is advisable to passengers be protected through vaccine against the virus A and B, against the C do not exist vaccines. 
The symptoms of hepatitis In appear two or three weeks after consume food is expressed by means of a bad general state, weakness, pain abdominal nausea and infected,. 
After that appear in the skin and in the target of the eyes the ictericia, the excrement is clear, the 'of colour dark and cure can last even two - three weeks. 
Approximately a million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease. 
The main reason for this is that, according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receive treatment pharmaceuticals. 
The hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer. 
The majority of those infected does not know who is ill because this agent in a gradual way the cells of the liver and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years after unhealthy destroys. 
It is therefore very important recognition premature, the systematic medical control. 
It is much more frequent this disease in three groups: the people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and which lead tattooing. 
At present there are some 200 million people in the world who suffer from hepatitis C chronicle. 
As to this disease can be discover with a routine control laboratory, is worth consult with the doctor of the family to experience some symptom unknown too. 
The disease has cure if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the body, so we can remove the infection and prevent cancer. 
On 30 September is the World Hepatitis, which was organised for the first time in 2004 by organisations representatives of the sick. Journey 
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of the chronic infections liver disease caused by the virus and the importance of its recognition premature. 
Will it hurts least who believe in God? 
According to the result of a recent research, religious faith is also the death of the martyrs of calming effect that alleviate Catholicism. 
Scientists of Oxford University made an interesting experiment: analysed that religious belief in what way influences the human suffering - reported the British newspaper Telegraph. 
In the framework of this unique experiment applied electric shock to 12 believers Catholics and the same amount of atheist, while both all were looking a paint of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, believers Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Thanks to the technique of escaneo human brain could verify that believers Catholics were able to activate that part of their brains that is responsible for the regulation of pain., 
This experiment is the first of the number of investigations in which the hand of academics also involved scientists, philosophers and theologians of the various departments of the University. 
The analysis happened in the following way; set an instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock sparkling. 
Researchers asked the participants of the experiment that set their sights on two paints; the Virgin Mary, work of Sassoferrato of the century 17 and the Lady of armiño of Leonardo da Vinci of the century 15. 
Researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary provoke a true and faithful, in both that chose the oil because of them because it was not too different from another, and thought they had effect reassuring. religious mood between 
Patients spent half an hour in a scanner, receiving in that period electric shocks in four parts paint of religious issue or the other successive while saw MRI of 20. 
Catholics claimed that in looking at the Virgin Mary felt in "safety" as people "protected", "be reassured and in its heart prevailed peace". 
By noting the picture of religious felt a 12% less of pain that when looked the work of. issue 
The psychologist Miguel Farias also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image as striking can be achieved a similar effect atheists also, only must find the appropriate image with. 
"We should find the portrait of a person for which feel very positively, and by a mother or father" - said the psychologist. 
The bishop Anglican Tom Wright held the result of research. 
"The exercise of the faith should and in many cases of truth change our personality" - added Wright. 
After these formidable results is a single question: what effect would have for the regulation of pain if you show the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or other painter his size? 
Is the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary would even better results?

In its tenth birthday the Google can say: you can find both in the pockets of the people, as in the sky above its head; knows where spent their holidays, what doctors visiting and what is interested. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough. 
Furthermore the sceptical that make a parallel with the vision orweliana do not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently declared the Financial Times that the main objective of bringing together the greatest possible number of personal data on their users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original aims of the founders of Google: "meet in a system all the information in the world! 'is Google 
According to the leader of the Google, the company even after ten years of work that is still in the initial phase of efforts to deal with all the information. revolved the World 
To the question that what will happen within five years Schmidt replied: I would like the Google could answer the questions as "What do tomorrow?" or "What would the work that should be?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions apparently as simple as long as there is no sufficient information to users. I better 
Not all surfers are aware that during its shipping in the Network is stored with precision the key words sought-after, directions of IP and pages where spent to conclude the quest. 
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that began two years ago, users can hold their own record of shipping, can return to consult what sought before, which opened and thanks to this record in this same logic will be based, in which the system we will offer products and services on the basis of the preferences previously defined and stored. Recommendations the create searches much more personalized 
What will happen if advantage my data against my same, gather information on my activities? - ask those who are seeing the monopoly informative of Google. users if 
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not the remorse, the fear for the punishment, the desire for freedom or rebellion against the power. 
However, it is a fact that not only retain, but also yield to third all expressions, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of surfers. wanted justifiable in cases already confirmed 
The example more discussed in recent times was perhaps coordinated action against the Brazilian, when Google handed the Brazilian Government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles. web would 
Instead, Internet users who are concerned about the rights of people, in the month of May, when the company together with the EFF for the defence of the rights that was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, it will be able to force Google, by any of the points of the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI. before the court, demonstrated successfully electronic, organisation alleviated 
At the same time, the federal government managed to achieve on the pretext of strengthening the law of protection of the child adopted years ago, almost fifty thousand directions of a few thousand phrases, but without obtaining the lists of search of individual users, nor full lists of web pages and key words of the last two months.) wanted Web and ( 
That is quite contradictory the opinion on the Google: we criticize those who fear supplying their personal data because they think that harms their privacy, their private life to begin to use the services of Google, and rebel against it as against multinational companies of image conservative. 
Meanwhile, the US and its enthusiastic supporters, Internet users and users of other countries, see them the future generation, the "vanguard", not to his rival the Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as, for much that both fight for the same objective. World conquering corporation geek culture 
This can happen because the Google contrary to the users, money for their applications, the code is open and the package of constantly, and it seems that the practice of official the software giant youth more, more collaborator actual free programme identification code is not asking Microsoft, no. 
But can also be because the geek see precisely the relationship between the rights of the people and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the key words more mentioned in recent years: the Web 2.0. existing very problematic 
The Web is collaboration, deliberate behind us and take the channels of communication available, and while the measures of these several individually, the substance remains the same: show ourselves. trace of 2.0 
A young collective pages, and even can together with other services, such as for example the Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their habits of music, then to these the can include in a monitoring system, as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can have a blog, in the most recent the gallery was stored in the Flickr or in the Picasa photos of automatically that appear in numerous normal can have profile, since Facebook until Xanga. 
We can learn many cases which shows that, for example, to see the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, learns with who spent the night can dismiss the employee of a company because this writes its opinion on the direction of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life is completely. revalorised blog sincere in its previous its bridegroom fraudulent or the girlfriend 
The life on-line 'of a person is what it shows itself - this is the definition behind the conduct of the youth of our days. " 
And it wants to hide something, or at least seeks to dodge the monopoly of Google, it can do (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search of Google, but leaves no traces). 
There are many people who do not want to register in order to prevent the can find, but it can replace on-line "of Google, since the software of drafting texts until the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions which were not the connect with giant servants or prepare the profile more perfect possible on us. applications" collective pages 
The public expects almost to the day when the Google shows its true face openly. 
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars worth more than 140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the areas of advertising of AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies, in both that services that are increasingly cause serious headaches not only for the Microsoft, but also to many other companies software developers. quickly IBM ( 
The observers will find, for example, the higher the protest of employees of doubling the price of the company, the number of employees, but all this is nothing compared with the fact that in the year 2006 the Google gave way to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked out any information that violated the moral and the interests of the Chinese regime. good food unlimited deemed too expensive child kindergarten categorically rejected also alarming contradictions critical however: management then 
One of the internal regulations of the company says that it will be announcing any new service in advance, but only when were already ready to function, what is certain is that foreseeable problems of the coming months and years the world: while some believe that the draft escaneo such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of their system Health, because in it can create our own profile, with past analyses, with our doctors and our problems. full health will Google and magazines of books and file can leaving no stone unturned if 
And the fact that will create a database genetic, can provide a good raw material for writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled popular, describes in form, in which a man only of data from Google can be described alarmingly well. orweliana those future Doctorow Cory, novel of Google

Some states today can still shaky to financial institutions, thereby saving bankruptcy with the taxpayers' money. tire belt of lifeline 
But if, as the sway crumble, then it will not be sufficient nor the new funds, nor the new improvisations still more bank. 
The long-term needs which the Member States of the European Union set aside its national egoism and centralised control over the financial markets fragmented. 
The financial institutions in the Monday over 100 billion euros - recalls the vienés Der Standard, adding that are increasingly concerns, as did the Americans, also European taxpayers will have to pay much money to solve the crisis. real just received crisis 
The EU has not so far taken seriously with the crisis that happens as a cúname by the Old Continent. 
The "saviours" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if defined: in what cases is justified use taxpayers' money to avoid a greater evil? 
The car intelligent keen the flight of abejorro 
What would be the best method for developing technologies in order to avoid conflicts, if not the imitation of sensors of obstacles in nature? 
For example the of the abejorros. 
In a surprising draft presented in the CEATEC of Japan, the abejorros gave the starting point for the next generation of the system of prevention of interference engineers of Nissan to design. 
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, devised the system of nature, to which they gave him the characteristics of the abejorros, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can cope with all interference. BR23C copycat car robotics direction such 
During the flight each creates its own space oval sign that in reality it seems much to our security - explained in the explanatory Kazuhhiro technological development and research. Doi, director of RP and protective contained in particular abejorro 
They play an important role the eyes compounds of the abejorros that are able to see in all directions in one angle over 300 degrees. 
To copy the role of the eyes compounds, engineers used the measurement system of the length by lasers. 
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in a angle of 180 degrees, estimated its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of vehicle that immediately becomes a manoeuvre to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds identifies the obstacle, then the imitation movements of the abejorros amending the direction turning to the necessary extent the wheels vehicle robot,. 
Unlike any existing system currently, this manoeuvre instinctive is completely. 
If not, the robot of vehicle could not react quickly enough to dodge the obstacles Andoh, head of the culture and the project of robot of vehicles. Toshiyuki explains "- hence" 
It must react immediately and in instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable of the protective of security, in a layer within which are currently considered as inevitable all kinds of crashes. contained internal layer 
All the process must reflect what is a abejorro to dodge other abejorros. 
This process must take place in an open and close our eyes. 
However, unlike the abejorros, the movement cannot address upwards, downwards, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of turn of the wheels diagonal or 
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities for the abejorros to dodge other abejorros here, just as a possibility for the robot of car the rotating movement and accelerating the frage used. 
The BR23C used batteries are lighter and is greater its density of energy, which means that they have a duration of living longer than that of lithium-ion. lítio-polímero of that 
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive reaction and intelligent and not the ability of processing of data, far less the storage. 
This apparatus in every second only must prosecute some signs of entry and react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store these data or react with a knee-jerk logic based on data from the previous games, used only some tens of kilobytes of memory. 
We need memories of gigabytes, nor of megabyte optical fibre cables. 
This is the first step to develop the technology to dodge immediately the obstacles, which according to estimates the Nissan, within ten years will join the models manufactured in number. 
Another possibility for its implementation is to incorporate the unity to satellite navigation system by to carry the driver to their fate, sidestepping the existing obstacles in its path GPS. 
It has behalf this costly child 
It has prepared the written version of the law of the package of financial rescue 700 billion dollars that apply in several stages with the purpose of buy the appropriations bad banks. ' 
In the first phase will be spent half the money. 
According to schedule of the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress came to an agreement on the package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion - reported the Reuters financial rescue. 
We have achieved an important progress - said, chairman of the American Congress, claiming that lack only formalize the agreement in a document would democrat. 
The commitment made on the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Finance Minister, talking about the outcome of the compromise said: this programme will work and will be efficient but we need other measures, is not save the Wall Street, but to return to the board of the economy would most. According to. 
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday night, as is before the two of the morning of Monday, according to schedule of Central Europe), without triggering a dramatic leap forward bags. (or Washington hours before the 8 
On the draft law so-called emergency law for the economic stabilization of the year 2008, the Monday first vote the American Congress and the Senate. 
The President George W. Bush in the night of Saturday consulted would and then the White House also welcomed the news on the agreement. 
We are happy with the progress achieved during the night and appreciate highly the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - declared Tony Fratto White House, the spokesperson. 
The programme is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration to spend all the 700 billion dollars to buy titles credit fundamental values of poor quality. 
We can only be spend half of the 700 billion dollars, using 250 billion immediately after the vote, probably the Monday of this sum the Ministry of Finance credit rating and the fate of other 100 billion dollars depends on the decision of the chairman., poor basic securities buy Congress 
This programme will be controlled by a particular body, which will also participate the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion will be spent after a new decision of Congress. 
According to the law the Ministry of Finance can implement a tactic combined: can buy simultaneously appropriations bad, mortgages and fundamental values, as well as other credits of type "poisonous" also. credit qualifications 
The purchase may be done at auction or in the competent people directly - reported ministry. 
The law allows him to companies affected participate in a programme of sure where the portfolio of finance ensures the elements worrying, by which will pay companies the amount corresponding to the damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson said: the necessary financial resources, which can reach even 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the financial system, whether the purchase of financial resources, or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions. assurance its bad American way ensures law until 
We all need to be ready to introduce the law as sign - added. 
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in distress and expect state aid can count on the official limitation of their compensation, that the American jargon parachuting simply called of gold. 
Only in some cases certain payments will be restricted, as well as the limitations depend on the form of aid from the ministry of finances. 
The limitation means that if the ministry purchase in the framework of an auction, it will impose an extra tax for the golden parachuting, unless we retire the head failed the bank. 
By buy appropriations bad government to ensure that the compensation of heads are not exaggerated. will intervene aggressively directly 
Furthermore are not going to change the contracts of gold, the limitations relate only to the new contracts to stimulate well also participation in the programme. existing parachuting 
This is the first case in American history that will be in force for the income of the director-generals - commented this measure the democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services. legal limitation 
The State will also acquire actions of banks participating in the programme, it will reduce the risk of taxpayers can even profit with the compromise in regard to recover the economy and with it the bank. definitive in right 
According to the draft law in the next five years President will have to present a proposal on the form of how to restore to the taxpayers the losses of financial sector Congress. 
Of course in both sides were those who expressed their reservations with regard to the project. 
It is this what us by American citizens, i.e. are not protecting the dollars of taxpayers - declared Congressman republican of California, Darrell Issa.

Review of press the area of German speaks 
The group of right-wing voters more aware - says the Der Spiegel on the weak CSU election result in Bavaria, only within the own group became is intact. 
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic publishing of the German magazine, in its Article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents' analyses the motives of the dramatic defeat of the CSU. left Franz Walter 
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU was started long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office. 
The Christian Socialists for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are those that give the back. 
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, also of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not totally amazing to the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that is already envisaged for almost ten years: disappeared the hegemony of undeniable a party of state. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained a 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50% since the 1950s. 
This was repeated three years ago, in the election of the Bundestag 2005, i.e. even during the so mentioned was Stoiber. 
The reason for this is the modernization CSU consistent in the province devorador of their parents. 
The 40 years ago, but the pace. However, the secularism, the results of education and the settlement of the North German in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the accuracy of the CSU voters were wrong much sociologists already are already predicting this. 
With the modernization also raise the possibilities and it also has political implications. 
The group of right is intact, only that within the own group became voters more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks precisely the citizens that most of the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrial, those who have high school and the diploma. chasing conventional groups were 
This is recudió at least 40% support the CSU.

Járóka: There is to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today has begun in Paris the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, their host is France that this year is also chairman of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, member of the European People's Party, in his message to the full, as one of the main speakers of this meeting, called attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations afflicting children gypsies and it is also the biggest obstacle to the foundation stone of their interests. prevale professional Fidesz by the 
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency, French Minister of employment and social affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities. - by Xavier Bertrand 
It was attended by representatives of the governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations of protection of social rights. meeting 
Járóka - according to the press bureau of a group of Members of the European Parliament in the addition of discrimination in employment, the Roma are outside the labour market in the first place by their low level of schooling. - warned that Fidesz 
"The greater part of the young Roma have not finished middle education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain university diploma". 
Járóka stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevale foundation of other human rights also. 
The investment in education of children gypsies at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the stupidity, it is necessary concientizar widely these issues both between the Roma as between the not gypsies.

CSU: grace for a transitional period 
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein 
Despite the serious electoral defeat, have not yet been severed heads in CSU highs Bavaria, for the moment has been delayed the debate on personal questions. 
Erwin Huber chairman of the party and provincial prime minister in their posts, but we do not know how long it will take the grace Günther Beckstein, still remain. 
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17%, will be decided in the congress party extraordinary meeting last weekend of October. 
The members of the much criticised duo hinted: not cling to both their jobs. 
With that sought to reassure the enraged members of his group and of its organisation of basis, who one day after the personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority "tsunami Bavaria" demanded. 
Five years - albeit under the direction of Edmund Stoiber that was at the top of their race - the union Socialist-Christian reached an 60.7% a year after the blow crowded against Stoiber, secured only a 43.4%. Instead now, 
The CSU for 46 years had 'monopoly "in Bavaria that gives by 18% of GDP German. 
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the conservatives are dominant, in the future without doubt must make coalition with someone. 
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice-president Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the possible successors of Huber also has a seat in the small group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the FDP liberal and with the Constituents Free from right on a possible coalition government in Munich. 
What strange of fate is that in the list of the Constituents Free enters the parliament he by Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken to the coup and then deleted cruelly stage to the ambitious policy Huber-Beckstein duo of local. 
The leaders of the CSU are investing now all its energies to stabilise Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now was moving the strings basically, the former chairman of the CSU described the 28 September as the day more bitter of his political career. provincial and government ex-jefe 
On Monday Huber made some critical comments the CDU, in its opinion had deserved much more support sister party. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and for its own Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be able to enhance together the CSU who played a key role in the successes of the national elections in 2005. Chancellor if not 
According to Merkel barely could hide their disappointment at the failure, losses will impact negatively on the great coalition CSU not Berlin. 
This of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the CSU wounded and the crisis of the Social Democrats. 
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition of Lukashenko 110-0: 
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no Member opponent in the Belarusian parliament. 
According to the observers Russians, this explains with the welfare and stability that Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this explains rather with violations of the law committed during counting the votes. Instead secured in the country 
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries, not acknowledged the election result. 
While the country of 10 million inhabitants, for more than a decade has no opposition, before the elections yesterday the united opposition under the name of Democratic Forces Nations (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, that for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the elections in 2006 of dubious legitimacy, by consequence of the amendment of the Constitution would "the entry of some members of the opposition in parliament. this time" integrated percent and ten Members, legislative 
So the ODSZ removed the boycott that originally wanted to do. 
In the substance of the expectations of the opposition, which increasingly depends more economically of Russia - which took a credit to temper the import of natural gas increasingly face of Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which gives permission of entry to Lukashenko and the other high-level political by having a political regime considered undemocratic. Beltransgaz was the Belarus 
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, to assess the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on the phenomena positive and not on the mistakes - such as the prohibition of participate tax to one-third of the opposition candidates. rather 
However the OSCE's own campaign - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in counting the votes. criticized even Monday's primary report 
With all this in view of the opposition is an improvement in the political climate: were released political prisoners and Minsk is prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia of Georgia, although Russia - which is a federal state - a month ago which considers the two regions as independent. theoretically Belarus 
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that has begun dialogue between Belarus and the European Union - declared to our regular Alexander Milinkevich. 
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections is desirable to maintain this situation, despite that "the regime fears allowing the entry of even an opponent in that parliament without weight". 
The opposition not plans to organize demonstrations in protest at the results, rather trying to reach the voters on the need to make economic reforms. his message 
- This clear we cause many problems because the opposition press in Russia, local authorities in their distribution, but even so I see that are increasingly which support change among the elderly, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate or even pensioners, which are the most subsidized by the regime. officially main also - said Milinkevich difficulties must print 
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the collapse of social security that "looks like the silence of the cemeteries" - felt Milinkevich. 
The observers Russians contrary to the democratic opposition politician they saw as the election. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States declared to the Russian people does not believe in words but in deeds ", so that the lack of the opposition is nothing other than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. Novosti She sends news agency:"

Figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the number of deaths on the murder. 
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil held in all the provinces of Italy 58 national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalised in the second Sunday October. No 
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days is the issue of prevention in the work", says the President of the Republic Mr Napolitano, in the message sent to the chairman of the Anmil national mutilated and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli., Association confirm as crucial

Napolitano does not hide that "there is without doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information. 
What is also extremely meaning taken the numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness of part of young people entering the world of work. 
It is a duty to keep alive the attention the phenomenon, not curb the alarm on the seriousness social, implement and improve the legislative rules. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of the deaths women constitute a social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decided effort to put urgently end." absolute 
"The data on accidents at work seem to point out a positive, but this does not mean that the number of deaths women is equally impressive", has stressed the chairman of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. andamiento slight 
"We want, indeed, that this" tendency towards reduction "translates into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention diminishes that exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that general level is still too little to compare the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be put into practice through many actions. 
They are necessary, to our criterion - has stressed Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger on the training of workers, and this from the world of school. "intervention

Hearing music to high volume for a long time using portable musical equipment can cause permanent damage to hearing. Mp3 readers as period 
It is for the European Commission, which in a communiqué issued in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee of the emerging health risk and recently identified (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today. 
"In this scientific opinion - we read in the 10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen with equipment for more than an hour a day bearing the apparatus to high volume risk losing a permanent hearing." portable weekly musical music felt note that 
"I am worried about the fact that a number of young people who use often portable musical appliances and mobile phones to aircraft noise high can ruin unconsciously their ears in way irreparable", states Meglena Kuneva. thus 
"In the scientific evidence - remains the responsibility Ue - highlights a clear risk and must react quickly. 
What counts is raising the consumers and pay this information in the public domain. 
We must re examine, as well as the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, for they are widely effective and take the step with new technology. " 
Bruxel had asked to examine the problem, seeing the great use of equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that creates. portable musical the Scientific Independent 
"The scientists - concludes the executive is cause for concern, and the European Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders that measures are taken to protect children and adolescents of exposure to noise from appliances portable musical related and equipment." better could possibly will now confirm that Ue. 
Currently, there is already a rule of European security which limits to 100 dB the noise level of equipment, but concern increases as the damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise. auditory portable musical 
It is possible to limit of much these damage using solutions as the reduction of levels and the time of exposure to noise.

He spoke eloquently about Rome, gives the path to the Commission for the future of the capital 
Today begins, in March closes, in June will be the accounts. 
It is this the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the 'Commission for the future of the capital of Rome', which has taken place this morning in his new seat behind the Termas of Caracalla. 
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission deliberate the main points to Rome. 
Once closed doors in March, the junta and the advice communal assess analysis and projects, in way of presenting in June the Piano strategic for Rome with the "official bollo" of the Municipality and its intendente Gianni He spoke eloquently about. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political, social and cultural tends to stress should provide proposals for the development of Rome in which to decide politically, the junta and the municipal council can then avalarse. He spoke eloquently about - ideas - 
There is no needless position of roles, only the willingness of having a place where produce a great project for Rome. 
In March completed the work will disappear, because this experience must have a temporary ends. 
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work of the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome '. intendente heralds. 
To those who accuse the Commission of useless, given that its opinions are not binding, "Everything depends on the work that will make the Commission and of the quality of their proposals. He spoke eloquently about responds: in degree 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, their contribution will be essential. 
Almost always the policy is crushing in the day-to-day management and in emergencies that back in return are demonstrating.. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look more long-term outlook, in a more profound, working with seriousness the development of Rome and its future. "there and 
The intendente of Rome tends to also point out that this Commission is neither a lame useless nor a truism: it is absolutely free of charge, not a euro to citizens and serve to participate and reasoning the best minds that exprime the capital. "Roman coastal" 
In fact, "it needs to have a strategic design as a reference, not to allow our city make a genuine leap, of which we have absolute necessity, thinking with unitary spirit to its future." level movement or closed He spoke eloquently about 
A future that is not limited only to the current communal but not only in terms of the future and of their legal status of Capital but "also considering the role to Rome can and must desenvolver as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." Metropolitan city look more beyond Rome intendente, needs the "corners" 
Do Obama? The first president anti-American American. 
He has written an American political note that move by independent: "Barack Obama will be the second chairman anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that with its decisions reduced the USA and tube relations (as also makes today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam. "economy 
They increase the attacks against Obama while the election date. 
has written a lady from Miami in a Web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a great side of stone: believes that won the office of the nation that has had two governors and five senators black! "most high. 
In reality are attacks that does not say much; they are clearly of racial and do not respond to the question of the electorate: will be a good President? And are also the opinion polls; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage. nature of attacks 
In this case there is who speaks with the heart but not with the brain. 
One day, in the heart of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the cockpit to vote know well who will vote the American patriot. the Mississippi 
A side of the American mindset taken covered until the last. 
"Whatever they want, we will think we then to where put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain". 
There are people who swearing-in: if it comes to win Obama, we would leave of America. 
things never these before now, that seems almost true the success of the black candidate. 
However despite, all these arguments, the weapon winner for the democratic George Bush. 
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the errors committed by Bush during its mandate? The 89% has replied: Iraq. 
Cambia America. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent home to kicked in the back. 
In Iraq are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been the weak point of Bush. 
Anyone who will assume the post of George W will have a duty enormous that desenvolver. 
It uses, the economic collapse makes itself felt also for journalists: in the newspapers is time of cuts. Many give the blame on the Internet, "murderous" of printed paper. 
Half a American journalists have been concerned by PEW Research Centre on the state of their profession and mental control for the future. 
While, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about its future. 
However, journalists have not stated openly feel less concerned about credibility. 
We feel isolated as once. 
The problem for journalists Americans is money, the money. 
The crisis in 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
Furthermore the cuts made in the room where the authors work to make the newspaper, is a major problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want the traditional as it understands the majority of the public is reduced substantially journalism. 
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today on the American journalist. 
Six on ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at national level this following a wrong way. 
In the field of local the group executive is 65%. 
Impreso against emission. 
It is difficult for journalists to see where is the web. 
The greatest houses publishing houses are opening up a gap in the Internet, for many view as the 'murderer' of the letter printed. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has risen to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that are embracing the technology in the hope that do something good "by journalism." 
The breaking more great today in the American journalism, or is the directors and journalists working for them is between who directed newspapers. 
The 56% of executives at national level is sure that their journalists share the same values, while locally percentage the low 23%. 
For some this has to do with the security of work ". 
The executives who think of job losses in 3 years are 47% at national level. 
To the journalistic staff is 30%. 
What of 'safe' to level staff (our authors, ndr) in America is always the agenda. working 
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract. 
In a nation vast as the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and becomes a question of 'take it or leave it'. 
The directors receive almost always good salaries, while the authors can win until 10 thousand dollars per month, more retirement and social insurance. 
To holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 days after a certain number of years to complete. 
But journalists Americans, by admission of yours, "contract" followed during the year. 
It is all a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF Rome, DANILO COPPOLA That QUEDA President GROTTAFERRATA 
The chairman of the second section of court of Rome, has decided to reject the analysis of the estate Danilo asked to be able to move from their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. Coppola Carmelo Rinaudo, criminal 
Coppola this studied by bankruptcy in the field of research on the pact on the escalation Unipol-Bnl against. 
In the course of the process of arrest in office, the week, has obtained the liberation, transforming house in mandatory residence to Grottaferrata. 
Their lawyers, Michele Gentiloni had asked that the route of the city of the province until a room of the capital can go and Gaetano Pecorella, property. 
According to the court, these journeys (for which the pm has given vote contrary) would allow it to influence their society and access to the evidence that accuse him. 
The elites in danger 
The phenomenon had already expressed some days ago with the vote of the camera of representatives against the plan of salvation of 700 million dollars launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested to punish Wall Street that to save the economy. 
It gives a confirms the New York Times yesterday gave us briefings that the current crisis is more divided between its old soul of the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, Washington 'and the world of finance, especially in the states of Central and South strong conservative, hostile to "those moderate, favourable, always disarming the party Republican Costa This. 
The soul, indeed, that has become grandiose with the vote of who spoke at the beginning. 
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here only. announcing economic earthquake barely mentioned 
Be in the United States and in Europe for some time the crisis seems to function as accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidified and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the re updating, the extraordinary revival, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re control of the economy. 
The crisis is indeed a crisis of institutions which have strong relations with the outside world, but especially are committed much more balances of families living in a single country and in a single state. financiarías, if, bancarias- funded the 
The that creates immediately a political problem for who governs: that is how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families that, on the other hand are voters. 
The crisis appears world economically but is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism or do not have much to say: the crucial test is The European Union that divided as always between the various interests and the different strategies is not decide no policy in common. state substantially outside stake seems 
It is the government of each state that all we expect a speech, rescue and revival, of new rules and especially the subsidy of funds: from the moment it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources to remedy things. financiaros reaches the court plans 
And also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two invaluable in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization cannot ever have in the same measure. probably, values resources 
This new emphasis that the crisis is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to give it to a factor very coligado to this element: the territorial scope. puts on the nation-state 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced have entered into the network of the most sophisticated, while we were convinced that the global finanza was intended to dominate the world, we noticed that our future will change that make the accounts ever more with things little intangible as water, crops and oil. intangible, always technology 
All things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land but are equally united in absolute way in an area confined, a territory. fíjate, 
So who is as sovereign, has certainly many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a seat without crops, without oil and without water. 
Now to the second novelty that but presaging a fracture. 
Anyone who says Territory, state, government, inevitably says common and Leadership. 
In this sense the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena converging. 
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for a leadership, the request of someone who knows take in hand the situation. 
On the other hand a wavelength discredit of the existing emerge species, economic relevada inadequate with many grey areas. 
And together something more profound and in a certain sense, an image inadequate, a sense of insularity, which tends to involve the whole ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number. A intolerance disrepute, a worrying: 
It seems more, in various parts of the population, the conviction that their actions are the same as those of the elites until now in the same way, its culture in the end, to have done the own time and to be more strange to the views of the majority. comprehensive exception felt and ever-growing social before forward always 
The demand for leadership, in short, a movement of delegitimise the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which are in a sudden recently, since the collapse of the consensus social-democratic in Britain, to rebellion of men of American congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the Right in Italy that has something to do). Austria-Bavaria in electoral 'revolt in changes or collective popular moods conservative exit "subterráneamente feeds arisen but powerful sections 
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectuals accredited, any more difficulty to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are strata of society and that the economic crisis renewed, growing and stirs potentially in overgrown. Western profound always make its format would say 
In the face of all this talk of a "rebellion masses' today is frankly excessive. 
But having open eyes certainly is not. 
The super glue to walk on the walls 
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls as the man filing. 
It is the objective of several research institutes Americans and now a team of four institutes was close enough. 
With a badge of only 2.5 cm scientists have had brought a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The ESTUDIO The American magazine published discoveries of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air force Research Laboratory. Some researchers Science 
The material invented by the team of researchers is evolution of existing that use a structure particular of carbon, so-called single-wall nanotubes carbon. 
‘ The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti 'explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta. 
Scientists have been inspired the leg of the gecos minuscule that can ensure the animal perfect adherence to mince, overlaid. 
The test facts on various materials, such as glass, teflon and role of lija, have shown that the new is ten times more powerful of the legs of this and at the same time "diverges from the walls' explains Liming Dai, investigator empowers the University of Dayton. of Engineering easily it badge 
CAMINAR for LAS PAREDES? - "This material could be useful as transitional badge 'adds Liming Dai. 
Capas to walk the walls exactly as the man? Capas yes, but researchers think a use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic equipment, because the single-wall nanotubes are drivers heat and electricity. carbon filing 
Other applications would have to do with the aerospace engineering. 
For the moment nothing of superhéroes. 
OTRA INVESTIGATION - I also the University of Berkeley, in California, is being devoted to the search for a new badge.

Beware implementation is also the multi operation with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in degree of open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
That is very interesting some functions as that which will reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example, to send it, or the possibility of importing the PDF in the drafting, retaining the original aspect of page. grafica module have electronic fun path of some modules specific 
We always on this front can create documents "hybrid", that the format of Adobe with the elements of a road calculation or a producer of text. PDF pile up the grafica typical 
The partnership is an element which has received various improvements within the aplicativos: in the road calculation can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of the modifies, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator given a colour in the comment on for a better recognition in the review phase. 
Some companies are also working to carry some functions of OpenOffice the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final outcome. 
The Italian version can be downloaded in the direction at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html and it would add to the English that was in the mirror from Friday. 
Moreover, as normally suite is also available for the operating system for Windows and Mac OS Linux. 
In asked can be sent also the cd of installation home or at work. 
And if the issue of free may be a hook to the dissemination in houses, is in business that Open Office the suite test, tries to the great challenge, and can count on several projects in the public administration and in schools. already area 
And there is no shortage of even the realities that offer a service of training, consultations and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could be open prospects of business ideal. 
Open Office consists of five main: Writer, for the corresponding the Word is the road calculation for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eaten in the case of the programme is to work in the dates back basis; and finally Draw the module graphic. consent to that Access known; Impress, Excel replaces Calc;, writing video modules 
objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that until today we reached almost 3 million 600 000, with the departure of the version can be overcome the target figure is likely to new already.

INMIGRANTES: NEW YORK TIMES That PREGUNTA, ITALY ES RACISTA? 
Italy of country of immigrant has been transformed only recently in a privileged destination for immigrants' welcomed with hostility. 
This is a nation of racist? It is what is question the New York Times in a long article devoted to the debate on the subject racism in Italy on the case of the original Guibre Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for having stolen a box of galletitas. young Abdul William beautiful in transforming the country 
This case shows what the New York Times defines the northern ": the northern regions are at the same time those with" more integration and more work "but also the more high feeling anti-immigrants of the country and the most high league North." can't stand "paradox 
As confirms the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the New York Times has also been mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
The new legislation beloved by the Lega the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as paradigm of climate cambiamiento in Italy. 
This marked by the Pope that by the chairman of the Republic: "Mr Napolitano - XVI in Congress has asked that the state and the church to work together to combat racism." to finding 
Students victims the rent expensive, until 900 euros by a room 
The rental market to the academics does not know the crisis. 
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of the individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. tenants hire a 
"the phenomenon has assumed very serious until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people by the extremely high costs that the family should sustain - explains the responsible for the office in these cities demand has totally distorted the market to such an extent of triggering a process of general increase until for residents." strong Mariani Laura Sunia's studies already characteristics 
In part that in most cases the offers of rents contain a series of violations: contracts type free, not recorded, without limit of fee, sub rents linked. 
To Sunia are necessary extraordinary speeches which, through the review of taxation, we can regulate prices. 
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, by a bed in euros; by an individual from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to an average of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in area Victoria). Brianza zone, serve 450 room 
In Florence a bed costs on average of 350 / 400 euros, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, serve 250 / 280 euros by a bed in a room double and 370 to 500 by an individual. 
In Rome in central areas near the University (Saint Lawrence, Bologna) you call for approximately 600 euros by a room individual and 450 by a bed in a room double. Plaza 
Only values slightly more low (550 euros by an individual room in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).) 
It is only if we change peripheral area: 300 euros by a bed and 450 by a room in area, Centocelle and surroundings. Prenestina individual economy 
In Naples by a bed you serve 300 / 450 euros, by a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with prices more high in the areas Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari by a bed you serve 250 / 350 euro, at least 350 by an individual. 
in cities more girls prices are more low in absolute, but has greater weight in the economy of the city. termines 
In the cities as in Perugia, where the phenomenon of the rents to students and applicability is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 30% to foreign students on the Italians 25 / fees. 
Farewell the old cinema Paradise, the cities cancelled historical rooms 
The historical film rooms close promoting the Multiplex. 
"A city film rooms in a city blind, is as a face without eyes" without. 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore fotógrafa with effectively what is happening in major cities Italians and also in the cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of cinema, that with the birth of the large in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the rooms in central areas of the city, is an event inevitable and indisputable with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. meticones monkeys 
In nearly always historic places, full of memory, "is as a friend, a well-known with which a piece of place and so much emotion, 'It notes the director of the new, the film that 20 years ago, and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, had a cinema of province and nostalgia for the way of live the cinema that lost perhaps forever. poetry back earn the cousin Oscar Paradise cinema was shared died if disappear. 
The figures given by the main of traders, speak clear: in the last five years have closed, and to pay most are sobretodos rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. traditional cinema 316 Anec, partnership 
Among the regions more suffered by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 less, following by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41) cinema. 
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the avenimiento of multiplex, are own these three Italian regions that have made the greatest number of new cinema screens in the last five years, 81 is in Tuscany which in Emilia-Romagna. meticones: 195 most in Lombardia register 
‘ The Italian, chairman of the Anec, "it would be useful to building new structures but would be needed to ensure the continuation of those that already exist, because when a room of city closes, not all its frecuentadores are prepared to be transferred to the meticones. has developed irrationally 'notes Mr Protti exercise 
That is not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state is approximately 10 million euros previous debt. 
It is shameful since the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year '. 
That is very interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried by the closures, decided to be repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema monkey room is in the historic centre that in the periphery. 
Among the rules laid down for the managers and advantages for the public in termines of mobility: viewers can enter the area of traffic limited and will have special tariffs for the facilitation mediated exist to fiscal grounds. 
‘ It is an initiative that I like 'notes Giuseppe Tornatore "and hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures. 
It is true, that for contrasts the power of the traditional rooms must improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding. meticones, extra 
The defence of cinema is a subject that for me: the closure of cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New cinema Paradise", which already thought for 10 years. Bagheria of traditional was always important

When energy is born of the waves, down to the scene large 
It is a field that 70% of the surface of the planet and we are now discovering, large companies world energy most exterminated. 
Olas, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which look the great as Chevron. 
The possibility of movements of the sea is studying for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, the investigations are enhanced. collect energy 
When the price of oil, in 1980, the idea of marine harness the energy was removed, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase of oil give impetus to the sector. under 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for the 2007 that 15% of the world could be covered by that exploit the movement of the waves of sea implant electrical need. 
This amount would be double the produced currently for nuclear power stations. 
And furthermore would be tides and currents. 
Gigantes the attack. 
The first company to bet on energy has been Enersis, that the 2005 has sealed an agreement to build a breast in northern Portugal. marine 
When the intention was announced was a step revolutionary. 
In two years of distance to bet on the marine energy are always more and between these companies that have voted always by traditional energy. 
"Chevron is considering the technology on ocean energy - has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US economic Wall Street Journal - and it is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us." to the newspaper has the oil colossus 
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permission of the committee for the American energy, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a signal quite important, if we consider that in Alaska the US continue to extract oil and President Bush has activated a plan for new drilling recently. 
Besides Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy that comes from the sea, the total invested until now, although not will be detailed indicate an interest in increase. 
Technology to develop. 
The experts speak of a technology even at the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a major environmental impact. 
For now, such as those Portuguese or the Scots are of small size and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem impacts. 
To produce energy to long scale, we must use a technology with greater environmental impact. 
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas together between them. 
The strength of the waves, which makes up and down becomes water with pistones roller internal to them and other boas towards pressure. 
The pressure is turning a turbine which feeds a generator. 
The electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cable. 
We are now four implant developing of this kind, waiting only of the federal, to part of energy, could serve to a military installation approval. 
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy to a commercial centre and for a parking submarine in the East River of New York, using turbines. 
The movement of water when there are tides, turning the paletas, creating a movement giratorio that feeds the generator of turbines. 
Verdant said that has a long list of customers to the hopes of permits necessary to use energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, say in the Institute for the development of electricity, merita at this moment the potential of tides. 
While this is a phenomenon that the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy are more intermittent, tides preventable. 
It is especially on energy and New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that are close to the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned an investment of 35 million for the 2009. from tides that states
