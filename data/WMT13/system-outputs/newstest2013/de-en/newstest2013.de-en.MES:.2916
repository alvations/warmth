A Republican strategy, to confront the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws that hamper the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills have been introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that the voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, also be shortened by these laws, the periods for the early vote, declared to be invalid, the right to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
In the course of the last two years, they encouraged to show bills in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced to a photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e., 21 million eligible voters have no identification document issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
There are, however, often to pay more than a hundred dollars, to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 years did not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are considered more voters, who will be voting for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo identification issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, it may choose the same states members of fishing or hunting clubs that more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a request.
Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that demand from the voters that they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures aim to limit the vote.
Because it is clear that two of the three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration for the general elections in 2004, to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted in five other states laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections were in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who constituted accounted for 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened in order to implement the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear objective is to influence the results in the key states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with any certainty that these changes to the electoral system of legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test on the way, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to further delay the already indecisive men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies carried out in the United States passed a number of spoilers between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without screening.
The study also showed that the probability of the formation of metastases to 30-40% is higher in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years ago, when there is no screening was carried out.
I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, if one has a direct relatives, who had already been ill with prostate cancer.
In men Afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, making the options will be presented to him, where Prostatakrebse can remain untreated, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men, where no one has detected cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers progression of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for a decision as to who should be dealt with and who does not.
That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
However, it is most important to talk with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," emphasises André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, Mastdarm, oesophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommended to limit the consumption of red meat.
It is too large quantities increases the risk of developing a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu-sur-Mer stressed how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzed the Higgs-only
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-bosons has caused a stir in the last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was our best of the standard model - or "at least" false declaration of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs-only.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week at a major conference in Kyoto, but there is a lack of data, to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we are assuming that it is actually the Higgs, there seem to be only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is all about.
In this world there is a law, which means that two objects may not be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and they do not try to do too much, because you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law is also for you: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are located in the same "Quantenzustand," with this "condition" is from some of their properties.
Based on the part of the particles in two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and obey the principle.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that you can, in fact, are located in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay, which we will not deal with here, and the "power" through which the large forces of nature and spread with the Higgs-only would somehow related.
But here it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are in the position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle speeds up with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field exactly at this place, "disturbed" about like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon, and thus one of the bosons "sources of power."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-only, with the difference that another field that Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this only shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to reach very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks.
This is why we need a giant particle accelerator at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve this kind of energy.
Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do not do this, but others - for example, a sheet of paper would never even in the refrigerator.
And not all of the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon) have no mass.
For all this research can now be "good," said Mrs Plamondon asks?
For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM.
Moreover, there are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some of the holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter has more major shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again!).
However, at CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to say, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw further scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Boyle - which has worked in the Bell, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the self-developed in 1962 the first laser (the first were gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning, rather than a "laboratory."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, has developed Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in a small room.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir
With your Committee "die in dignity," Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of life.
The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this important area.
Le devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which had aufzehrte him, let him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said, half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he was reached the day before.
"However, there is always a shock, you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease makes their work: an immense weakness prevents him to go to the toilet, and even to eat alone.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned to help with dinner.
Even succeed him to smile and to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, around him bring his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in the stand," Pierre-Victor-Gadbois told Brodeur, a psychologist in the home.
In the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation returning home for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," to take a step backwards, he notes.
According to several people who work in the palliative care to find great events taking place in the midst of this regression.
All the patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses, who care about you, not with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, "and" by suffocated to death.
But I learned my children really know by the disease.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before she accepts that one up a mask, which helps her breathe.
You can expect in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who comes from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake.
The palliative care will then be used, if there are no other options.
To make it more enjoyable.
In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, if you take into account that we all die someday.
Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Given the dying according to a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will be drinking beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," director Nathalie Savard reported.
The home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, which enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years ago, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"Six months since three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago," said Dr. Christiane Martel shares with concerned.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say to a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health-care system Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to a quality palliative care, before it is accepted, move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, no one has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And, at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST treat their patients despite the worst predictions doggedly until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will break off the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end of the day.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be said clearly that the palliative care is not in pain treatment Janet Quarton.
After Monereau, director of the palliative care of society of domestic palliative care of Montreal are talking about 8% of patients to a pain treatment.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to the-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer do so, as if we do not take this side of suffering.
Patients without pain will increasingly be able to fall back on these-terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want that they put me," but "I would like to say that my pain is relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Administration, companies in the construction sector, creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed.
A "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange, as the system is unraveling, since it has taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and a former head of the Montreal police witzelt.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties in Quebec, which had reluctantly agreed with the then Prime Minister.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "would have been the Transport Ministry alone saved $1 billion on the Treaties," because some zügelten your instinct to get their share.
The Commission, "Charbonneau already has two mayors brought to fall," he adds, "in the hope that it will be able to show the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit taking with their troops to auditors, the government and analysts also identify a great deal of effort.
In addition, the police force, "the" marteau, which has since 2009, that the "cartel" Montreal is more circumspect in the artificial inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has made house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third-largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Moreover, engineers have been accused of Straßenbauamts of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission explains the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years, 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator, associated with the Mafia gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr zambito has had in the 2000s throughout his hand in the game, he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of political parties, especially on the power of his liberal.
He also admitted to have organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles surprising has described it in detail before the Commission: ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 in return for contracts, whose costs artificially pumping up.
Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they were artificially aufblähten the bills with false benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party's mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay accused that he deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, which has filled its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations at the beginning of November, Mr Tremblay resigned, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, which suggested an alarm.
As a citizen mistress of the budget of the city district of Rivière-des-prairies, in the east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of a community that, for $5 million was bought and sold for 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market.
More than 70% black money in the election campaigns
The investigation, which is being carried out at the end of the day, she says that they "on a thread, which allows you to understand the workings of the system of ants migrated to stop the evil and to condemn the culprits."
She says that the procedure "was painful, but in a positive way."
We are trying to clean up the wound, but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean power.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all thoughts about the role of the "mandate, which are about the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of more than 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: "I was told that this is only a weak imitation of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100, which would change nothing in the situation, according to him: "as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "we cannot fall deeper; when we go to the bottom of things with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh, to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain to him through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players are coming.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my level of play.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
They are taking advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition...
The latest games this summer are accustomed to a very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player, like I, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in terms of my position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I do.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
As a matter of course.
Jeff inspires respect for all the technicians.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The confidence that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the.
But we are lurking in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified us in this way for the eighth finals.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are going to talk with against a very good European teams have our say.
First, we want to be the first of our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game.
The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club?
He has already been the budget...
In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Weld together the resources so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this title.
In the last season, we were informed.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to cope with the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has had an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we can win in a home match against Troyes 4-0, and it is still a little place, what they accuse us, and that is certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to make a game concept.
A team builds up with the times.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club of the past two seasons failed to qualify for the eighth finals, and which has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed you to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore.
Geboostet, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season of this new PSG were not good. "
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, smiling winner, and we say that we have finally won, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he is coming, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has led in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This stimulates the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all the others, in order to make progress.
How do you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was to take part in my heart, at the European Championships.
Unfortunately, something has to beat my injury prevented from playing time.
I saw things, from which I am emerged stronger.
Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behaviour on the day.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
It was, as well as Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal, he had qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain, forced draw (1: 1) a game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin without paying and selling bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system designed by banking monopolies, leading to financial crises.
This is indeed by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange, such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions have already been collected.
A few thousand websites Bitcoin accept as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 has reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to $2, before he has recovered today at around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest for this purpose.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make headway in a video game, which you can win games or buy (and sometimes back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
Each time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, trustees of the Court of Auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the traded Bitcoins are taken into account in the book in the entire network of public accounts.
The decisive step is to contribute to this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege, add this additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
"The computer," the new transaction and add a number before the whole thing is being hacked to bits. "
The goal is to find the one number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, and the other nodes can easily check, whether it is the right one.
The transaction is closely linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes), with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network, and the other remains without a link, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with each improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.
"The vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes," Pierre Noizat, which has just introduced Paymium, this is a company for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin assured.
The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering by using this anonymous service.
However, cash has also these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
They will be accepted by others, such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the invoice book and shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-Schlussverkauf" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold looks forward.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book on this currency firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages its identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented at the dealers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone "and" recognized, Pierre Noizat indicates, which assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems to be reconsidered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until 2013 Bitcoin prevails, but could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB sees in her report to assess the various today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are likely to follow at the end of 2014.
It is high time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without having to expect all of us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our soldiers killed 88, as well as the injured and damaged.
The Taliban often consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
Do you want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if you have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Sometimes tolerated, supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there, and if the Western countries to be more discreet.
Financed by the base in Nijrab, which I have observed with almond trees planted hills, using the French loans was the withdrawal of French troops, was carried out properly.
The tanks and helicopters überflogenen truck convoys have reached Kabul, without having to be attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
Kabul was empty at the time and the country as a result of the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
The takeover was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to the security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the al-Qaeda organization divided farmers, but their situation has not yet improved.
Former mujahedin, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are coming back to power in 2001.
They have turned themselves in business, they have seized plots of government, in order to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefit from the massive American awarding subcontracting.
You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, people do not want a government that is composed from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who have been able to make use of the American donations: capital flight is considerable.
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls as boys.
These young people who do not want to go back to the obscurantism of the former parties nor to the corruption of some executives, one will have to make jobs available.
All parties, including the armed, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world is being watched everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle has already committed to the restoration of the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzaï wants no foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, it is his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were not re-established, functional storage plants are not available and important irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables will be produced nothing.
The private initiative will be the priority.
In a country that has been directed by 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, to seize.
Without energy, to handle the iron or copper ore mining on the ground, or without any means of transport for an export over the mountains is not possible.
The Chinese have left the copper mine mes Aynak already almost, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site, and the most important employers remain in the province.
One day, it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on exports and the produce to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young colleges, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carry out of a small French non-governmental organization, to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, for the number of local workers were required to contribute to suppress the uprising: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase of farmland.
Let the military spending of two billion back?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, which are very hard in these often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres valleys.
In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of communities in the province of Kapisa.
So that the farmers get rid of the insurgency, which is led by foreign groups according to their own statements you wish to continue lower, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid would be required for their benefit.
A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, which granted him temporary unlimited power, more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt is based on a number of occasions now for almost two years ago on a provisional, the amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has provided only for greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic" Delirium, "when he breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the sides of his supporters we are assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which the brothers forces to abandon their plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president is once again to find it a manner, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest rages across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote will be an ultimatum: "either is true for my draft or do I keep the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the constitutional assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
On the eve of the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have been turned away, because they are of the opinion that they are not in a position to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted alike.
In order to achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, Deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day is... In the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clocks  the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which has been adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which attracted all the attention is identical with that of the constitution of 1971, and states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that "the principles of" by "to replace the" rules, which would have made it possible to make a stricter application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals say that this can only be seen as a propaganda.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution via other articles.
In doing so, they have particularly Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in terms of the examination of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is worrying, because the people who are not being asked for an opinion, "have been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university is likely to be much less moderate than the present.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no ulema, but academics, who have been trained partly in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased.
He admits, "that can have an ambiguity in terms of the article, because the terms are used borrowed the religious vocabulary.
It is here, in particular refers to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will be severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers, which he was granted to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on the use of civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears in relation to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines HEBA Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to say yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.

The Dead Sea is even warmer and there will be bathed in all the year round.
Moreover, this unusual sea is a situation of 417 meters below sea level, the lowest in the world.
His turquoise water has a high salt content and even swimmer on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come for treatments using salt water (natural) and mud flows, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and vulnerable to calm nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These mysteries of the old city of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Tel Aviv on the Mediterranean coast.

"The great and powerful leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members of Parliament and civil rights activist discuss the usefulness of the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers to come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each working immigrant must pass a test, the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far this provision applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time, according to federal immigration authority should be in the future for all guest workers on duty.
We must not only language tests, but also take tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language must be demonstrated both for the conservation, as well as the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
It is also exempt from this law, people who receive their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The problem, and the protection of the rights
The whole of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, St. Petersburg of the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, the State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can put the tests in all the cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 center opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration authority.
On the other hand, human rights activists said prior to the entry into force of the law in the press on a number of occasions the following question: what makes the whole thing?
What changes does the legislation to have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?
Above all, spokesman of the migration authorities say, it is trying to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrants," says the head of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must be protected, however, already before departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
On the problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stuck with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home is the one you promised, and they are cheated on arrival, have taken their passports and do not receive the promised pay," the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed.
Rail, chief!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not control not only the language of the country, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their debt, rather than the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because, in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager then these children to take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language," they admit.
"You still feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activist in terms of the law following an important aspect.
The test only migrants must discard with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no review and, therefore, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "ban on access for unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fabricated, and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow manifests itself against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers,"
Already on the day on which the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates which certify the completing of the language tests have already been beschlaggenommen by employees of the federal immigration authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, that the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to spare the tests to be paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: it costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, are united both officers, as well as civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time by the test, only promise that you will have time for a language course.
In addition, in areas will be newcomers without language, in which no active understanding is necessary with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
Thus, the authorities to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police do not want to ban the deadly weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been the chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes will be presented to the arms of the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems through "attraction of the screws."
An open letter was published in the Internet, whose authors call - representatives of various associations - from the authorities to take the "senseless" distance.
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the experts in criminal law, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC said.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousands of crimes have been recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will hold criminals not to use on the black market.
At the moment, you can find in Moscow, according to the authors any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons come through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff told.
Screenshot of a web page, which accepts orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from the Russian officers, as well as the Kaukasiern themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal weapons, parcel of criminals will be stolen.
Baranez explained that include weapons that were stolen, both from the arms of the police, as well as directly from employees of the law enforcement authorities.
Further illegally sold weapons from military arsenals.
Many military camps, it often came to explosions.
"There is evidence that there was, in some cases, arson, to cover up the absence of weapons," says the former military personnel.
According to make a contribution to the black market arms manufacturers Baranez.
"Nowadays there are squandering countless private arms factories, which do not withstand international competition and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, which organized the smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated share each of the five channels to supply the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for problem analysis and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for government statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators from the Army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are tirelessly to get through the "debt of leaders, which have to do with weapons in their work," it says in the report.
According to the data, the researchers 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% back to thefts of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sale of a weapons store, which does not want to be named assured that weapons, which can be found in illegal excavations, nobody buys for a long time, since they are out of date.
According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supply in an arms depots.
For example, on an ensign a weapon, a gun is bought by the type of TT.
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he tells
"The police, of course, knows about everything and, therefore, if they do not comply with the plan to the detection of crime, periodically Kontrollkäufe dealers, the illegal weapons sales consultants offer," which adds.
"As in the luxury '
Buyers and sellers find most well-known to each other.
I had seen my websites and blogs, as someone who was to draw attention to myself and I proposed to come to the station "Begowaja," where a person would be waiting for me, which would like to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the only weapon I learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"I need to get a weapon, a well-known, the contacts," which tells sales consultant. "I have such a well-known, but I do not trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code as "by Ivan Iwanowitsch, which set up the subsidiary that has lost a tooth."
I am currently even in some of the rings on a well-known, whom I trust.
He also gives me the key rings only because he knows that I am not verpfeife him.
Newcomers are searching for weapons in different ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album, in the "everything" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury," recalls of military personnel.
According to the buyer gets Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I do not simply as a potential customer purchase, but the seller in the forest, and this is where we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," the expert describes the action.
Shopping
Internet search engines search results to websites and groups in "VKontakte," where weapons are being offered "for different purposes."
There will not be any papers still needs, there are personal meetings.
"You need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "combat gun or rifle."
There, users give up their orders and ask questions.
It is also sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," user "Ivan" asks (direct quote).
"Buy a TT." Moscow, the laconic request from "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service recently shifted countless Web sites, and who want to purchase weapons, shoppers are crowding into the network.
The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then land in Siberia and shovels coal
Military kommentator and former military members Viktor Baranez
I have heard from following scheme: the website is registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The officials take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an automatic teller machines.
In response, "he receives a photo and a description of the captivity of arms," said the press spokesman of the non-profit organization, "Pravo na oryzhie" reports Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that one can come to the conclusion, empty and locked up, if you placed a question on a Web page.
The Federal Security Service recently shifted countless Web sites, and who want to purchase weapons, shoppers are crowding into the network.
"The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camps and shovels coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
When buying illegal firearms, according to experts is to be expected with prices from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislow of the organization, "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for up to one and a half months.
The weapon will be spent in military arsenals of middle-class.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal weapons throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand back, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to 7.8%.
In the United States almost food- and supermarkt- workers strike
One in four American teenagers sitting behind the cash from Mc Donald's
In the last few days it was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will continue, or whether you soon the air goes out.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and almost food- employees, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far this sector of the economy is hardly organized trade unions.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, which were held in the United States, the Ausverkäufe attracted millions of customers, which has led to sometimes to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people.
Cannibalizing sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries up to dust extractors, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only on their own work.
Prices and product lines were cannibalizing to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics often cannibalizing the goods can only sell so cheap, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about working conditions, for example, lack of forklift or scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday," asked for wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, which earned 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increases the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.
The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay.
To make the wage increases would be cannibalizing fully to the customers, they cost more in the future only 46 cents.
That would be a year for you today, compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars.
Advocates of cannibalizing satisfied to note that it was only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period cannibalizing sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart funds led to the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees work and the protest only "another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests, was.
"Free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their objective, however, were not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and that is why so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage legislation in accordance with federal and New York is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants will raise the minimum wage, but not too strong, and the average in their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No less than they deserved in this expensive city.
How is it possible, to come to New York with so little money, incomprehensible.
There was once upon a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's people who complain that they have to come up with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants will receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance, to stand in the way this objective and to urge union members or to fire.
On the other hand, the company makes it will not be easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
On this day Lautstarke protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at midday before the McDonald's at the Times Square, in which some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food staff together, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, which everyone deserves New York!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are far from being employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses.
"The brain can trick has been only moderately,"
The supporters of modern technologies popular theme of the enlarged reality is perceived lately, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented in summer at its annual conference in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In the interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It irritates the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space.
- please describe what their research group operates.
- we are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction.
So far, the humanity is largely stuck in the phase, worked in the pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touches.
However, we want to look 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the new generation sensors, a step forward, and today no longer being sold without, as all interested in motion control.
- what awaits us in the future?
- even though the interaction on a physical level, much still unfolding on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decided.
We are trying to change that work on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need to dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make fassbarer.
To do this, it is necessary, however, that it is not only the users, but also its surroundings is detected.
Then we could complement the real world much easier through virtual objects.
And we should first and foremost this bescheuerten virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about language control?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always like to inform all the others about his actions and intentions.
In fact any kind of interaction is good with computers, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, instead of with sweeping gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet, which registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is a relatively large, however, in theory, could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But on the whole, however, the future belongs mixed types of control, for example, gesture and language.
- like that?
- me, for example, we would ask you to them Sprudeldose?
They say it, and at the same time.
- Normally I say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- in other words, they want that adapts to the user what can make a machine at the time and what is not?
- not necessarily, but we are talking about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we will have to work in the near future, particularly on the development of new types that allow us to capture reactions from people in more detail.
This could be, for example, laser sensors, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- which claims on the basis of their work with the Xbox 360 the new generation sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be a bad thing.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms more work.
It must not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the z-axis will be taken into account.
Also, the speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and open said, are the current 30 fps, especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device, only without the touch-control and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
- is currently working with three cameras, with one of them, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
They are not used to calculate the object.
Perhaps more cameras could solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
The new generation would be a flexible, similar system in which we could play with different camera inclinations, to determine how it helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- if I remember correctly, Microsoft presented to the public, in contrast to Google his glasses.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life has the best prospects?
Of course, it is not pleasant to hold a smartphone in hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of glasses on the smartphone,
The glasses is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private can only see them), but also its weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses that they can work together with other virtual objects.
- we imagine for a moment that the virtual holograms manipulation in the air, not only from the Iron Man, but also accessible to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers your group wants to give to this objection?
- in my lectures, I often assume that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as something unusual projection.
It performs excellently pressure.
But there are also technologies that are, in fact, to give the "pictures in the air," something tangible, for example, the interference of some ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, however, when someone these fallen on the palm.
There are also bands for the wrist, which affect the Nervenendungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- they have tried to outflank the brain?
It is thought that it is what it should be, if it looks like something?
- it is a good idea, so we have tried it yet.
Here lies another task, with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a man who physically located in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can outsmart only moderately, and that there are still a lot of work ahead of us rich years.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.
Instead of their own culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "avant-garde," which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde art and culture.
On the list have already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and who often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt of extravagant artists Miller.
The whole town knows Miller, the bearded, dressed in red and one time at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Miller, they attract large crowds.
Miller is one of the typical of St. Petersburg social philosophical artists, the new myths.
Miller is a luminous personality of the avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up by his presence on the street for his fellow citizens a smile in the face and makes you a good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg summertime, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his life, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready.
Why, for example, you're not actually always in red and yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
Everything in the society, which deviates from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- when you know that you need to be?
- at an exhibition in the Cultural Palace, in which my works were exhibited.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then there is the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter came to an end at the time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I am friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; "Rachmaninow" and then once was concluded.
It attracts me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, in fact, apart from the literature.
- and all the united in your kind of clinic... - it was important for me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best new artist should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there until the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: name., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, as with his project "Ucho van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore T-shirts, and also to you today's hottest composer Igor Wdowin belonged.
When the group began to play live, was removed from the "Leningrad."
The costume moderated many programs before the time of "Halli Galli."
We gave them the costume, and it began his career, but he learned the basics with us.
Even the gallery "d 137," or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the clinic.
Our employees and regulars were there.
I am a hero of the last century, as culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "Artist of the Year," and so I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution.
- your works have an unmistakable style.
- many of my pictures are genuine pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of the ideas expressed.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
In the past, I was afraid of social, but now it hurts and is preparing to be the case.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone respects the clothes and is based on the outside, not the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a people's hands, but should he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today, commercial art must be careful and considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were the other major groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to fall.
I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each.
Now you have to think you, whom thou shalt case.
Now, each about 100 supporters.
- to the performances of Stas Michailow, however, several thousand!
- abandoned women come to him, where the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less money, and all perish.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is that you do not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty in order to rejected time and money.
This is the culture that I support.
Petersburg - what is missing?
- good cultural experts.
One says: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have experts who could be, but you will be the road, because it requires hochrangigerer experts who assess the former right and make them the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that you have to say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some other museums.
Petersburg - which is for you?
Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art can grow up is difficult.
For example, we need a cultural ferment, because we now have more writers as readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants in the town of St. Petersburg
Born in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with planet aboard on the search for a replacement.
To save humanity, the important question is how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the spare planet?
In my opinion, there is not a lot of choice.
In fact, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars, however, are relatively friendly, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all the possible.
The question of reproduction in all the researchers treated first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century earlier experiments have been carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the difference in orbit bred peas are not in the least by the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of the tiny fruit flies (), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It has developed a normal chicks.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained.
Without a solid surface the chicks tripping over their tongues.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn fully.
The chicks responded to light and loud.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let slip chicks and made the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all records.
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only to be located on the bio-satellite "Bion" homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been sent in the fertilized.
In principle, it was found nothing special.
"It was just the bio-satellites, but once again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Vladimir Sychew noticed.
After the landing of the space rats were young.
The issue of reproductive directly in space could not resolve so far.
The task is a difficult one.
Animals, who will travel from their natural habitat cannot simply follow their reproduction.
In contrast to the human animals could in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
From the ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying in all 50 years ago.
It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova.
The most valuable asset that has humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew them, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight?
They will be able to bring a child into the world?
"After all, nobody answered that question," says veteran Wachtang Watschnadse space.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew was also kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even if work outside of the space vehicle gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where, after long flights everything went well, and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in orbit," cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and concludes hero of the Russian Federation.
But humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the centre of the Cosmonaut is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here, in a state of flux the Cosmonaut routine win for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants water as a natural element.
It is, as the small Ichtyander would bear witness that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother is in the water, and the water that it can then make it easier to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just two weeks ago.
"This is too little time to forget about something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur speed back and thus also takes the ability to press the child.
Well, we go through geburtseinleitende tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, the child.
"But what happens then?," which is not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
Without having to feel the earth attraction, the organism can't form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in orbit as an adult to the training in a suit.
He is simply the absence of what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment will mean that we will have a disabled person, a completely unadapted people to the world," the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts.
So far, the birth of children in the world is all mere theory.
At some point, however, it will be a reality, when the earth's inhabitants to break into your space ships to a distant planet, which will be the home for their offspring born in all.
Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, falls back in their application.
In the interview for Aktuálne.cz of Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," said Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
Prime Minister Petr Necas as a negative example he leads the attitude to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system now is banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, however, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not just the chairman of the government, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it?
It is a parallel review, with which we have started about two years ago.
Easier said, it is important that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislation and, finally, there is the real practical application.
This is all we have compared with each other, and even though the review is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are with us, maybe even a little "strict and perfect," the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish, always new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How you can be an aid project? What emerges from this project?
It is precisely such a joint control could help that we stop to constantly strive for a perfect balance of the laws and the lowering of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact.
Efficiency means one thing to purchase at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and rule out unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It is perhaps even in such a way that we are only the excessive burden on the system in this way, "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to use the system, as if the threshold were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What is the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only a little differently, but fundamentally similar work both authorities.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are courts of auditors in the individual Länder - is the German system differs from our.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the land audit offices there.
As regards the German legislation, it is easier than our?
In general, I would compare this reluctant without any concrete information. However, in a sense, is often described Germany as a model, but you can certainly not say, however, that Germany is better.
Perhaps it is that the auditors are better there?
This is not determined, but as I said: I don't particularly like comparisons.
This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to contend with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn't it?
As regards the Czech legislation, which had meaning for their authority, the revision of the public procurement law, you already feel any impact?
Given that this is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
Since our controls take place later, you have to expect here with a certain amount of delay.
We feel so far more impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified
You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption has been confirmed.
It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules are "severe," and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules are an audit of the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, accountable to the Regional Council) to the effect that any breach of the public procurement law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But then it is useful to make the law even stricter?
I do not think that in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a mistake, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
Firstly, we say, which is not targeted way.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
The black system is banned or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the government can not come easy chair, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: 'we change the law and allow the matter, "but he could not say that we are doing so, as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded solely because of errors.
The law will never be completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that is what is missing from us.
There is some Eisglätte on the streets, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of snow and Eisglätte is partly in the Czech Republic.
On the contrary, however, the roads are good, sometimes increased caution is needed.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary were the streets this morning, there was snow and Eisglätte.
The temperature fell to -5 to -10 ° C, there should be a little warmer during the day.
Snow in the region, and it is no longer in the lower altitudes only a thin snow remains.
The combing of the Ore Mountains are, however, about 30 cm snow.
According to the district of limited visibility due to fog.
The highway r6 and the routes of the first class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is needed, for example on bridges, where the roads are sometimes crampon and smooth.
All roads in the second and third class, including the mountain roads are also.
On these roads, however, remain section or ausgefahrene snow remains.
Therefore, increased attention is needed, especially in the higher altitudes.
Districts pardubice and Hradec Kralove
On some streets in eastern danger because Eisglätte, at higher altitudes and in the mountains is located on the streets are sometimes a ausgefahrene snow layer, with shares the roads and highway principals on their websites.
The Straßenmeistereien Eisglätte warning drivers that can occur, especially in higher altitudes in the district of pardubice.
In particular, it can come to Eisglätte on traffic due to the second and third class in Ústí nad Orlicí Lanškroun circles, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow, in particular, on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické Hory.
A ausgefahrene snow layer is located at elevations on the streets of Rychnov nad Knežnou and timetables.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is now mostly sunny and serene, and it remains largely free.
The temperatures move between -3 + 1 ° C, it is a weak wind.
District pilsen
The streets in the district of pilsen are today is necessary, however, increased attention, and the driving is to adapt to the weather.
This is the morning chill, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it has snowed in advance, and then the temperature fell, it can come on the streets to Eisglätte.
It is to be expected with fog, with the view, however, will improve in the course of the day.
These figures come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The D5 motorway is virtually unlimited, increased attention the Straßenmeistereien recommend, however, between 80th and 131 kilometres.
The first-class are mostly dry, but freezing.
However, in the south of the circles pilsen and Tachov, it can come to Eisglätte section.
The second and third-class are wet, and therefore also applies here, the reference to possible sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area.
Olomouc district
Today, with mud slush must count on drivers who are on the road in the direction of the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
According to the use of cluster vehicles remains slush on the pass Cervenohorské sedlo, as well as on the road in the direction of Videlský kríž.
The Straßenmeistereien forced to use, in the town of about 3 cm fresh snow fell according to the road management.
In the other areas of the district which roads are passable.
"In the Šumperk snow remains still remain in the altitudes.
On the pass Cervenohorské sedlo drivers in the direction of Jeseník must reckon with Schneematsch, "said an employee of the road administration Šumperk today with regard to the agency CTK.
Also had their colleagues in the district of Jeseník out in the night, according to their information, the streets are free until the altitudes of chemical treatment and wet.
The roads are passable, in the county of Šternberk drivers must, however, be careful, because the roads are wet.
Ústí district, district liberec
In North Bohemia Straßenmeistereien report several bad passable road sections.
In addition to several with snow or Eisglätte mountain road from Telnice is locked after Knínice in Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain in deeper layers below zero, so that snow and ice on the roads from the low levels, particularly in the southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the other hand, are reported no problems, and the streets are usually dry.
To date, no traffic disruptions are reported.
Eisglätte is reported, especially from the periphery of Štetí.
According to meteorologists, there was rain and melting snow in the ideal conditions, day and night, in the cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes, as well as from the road I / 13, on the border of the districts and liberec bad traffic conditions are reported.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of Rohol, which were down by the snow load up on the road.
Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the world should take place in less than a month?
This is a disaster of those messages, to which we are so happy to jump to people.
With our band, The tap tap to make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can gather enough positive energy, to stop or to prevent the world.
In December they realize there is a unique project with three concerts against the world.
You can imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21: 00.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone around 12 hours before us, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea comes from whom?
Originally from me, then we have shaped the idea, together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we would like to not only collect sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the world, but we also want to consider, along with the public about the state of the world we once handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key fobs us against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support.
The band The tap tap has included, along with other performers also the so-called national anthem against the doomsday titled "world."
Today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. It will be performed on the charity concerts?
Of course, and certainly not to conclude, provided that everything works, and the world does not take place...
The national anthem should be sung by all of the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit of the Czech television.
The text of the anthem by Tomáš HANÁK, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl x sings with...
As you have come to the cooperation with the two?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which relates to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We are trying to involve us, these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts benefits against the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we are already working together for six years with the club tap in the Jedlicka Institute.
Students of the Institute of Jedlicka are regularly maintained by editors, which will help you in different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to seek the editors, we want to help you in this way.
In the completion of the Institute of Jedlicka its own building should be created, in which we have a draw with this project.
A number of groups and performers at each concert occur.
According to what criteria they have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China, support lesbiens, Illustratosphere occur with Dan Czech, the tap tap, Marián Bango and JIRÍ.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big venues," are also planned for the future?
In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - it would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their plans are not very small, so far, they have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group, which is composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with these logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. Also, of course, we need to carry a lot of luggage and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always been worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised to find myself sometimes.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through its foreign trips, you have a comparison, etc., as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks like, how to deal with people with disabilities
How do you have seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East is still everything in its creation.
Moscow is absolutely not vis-à-vis Prague for disabled people. There, it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone in the center of the city is on the way.
It is still not there, of course, that you can be a wheelchair users, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs that try to point out to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things that we depend on...
This is to say that an improvement in the situation depends on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities move independently in the public space, go to the museum, you can use toilets, etc.
But it is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the social events, we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead.
In respect of the public and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of particularly strong personalities.
The tap tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what has motivated in 1998 to found a band?
At that time, I started as a supervisor in the Jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people, who were keen to deal with something.
And since I am a musician and saxophone games, I have founded, along with a colleague, a music AG.
Well, and by the time this is how our moderator to say Láa Angelovic, something out of control (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, or I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation has helped with well-known singers; in addition, we have also begun to advertise for us.
To us, it has become aware that if you are doing something and not to be seen from the outside, it is its own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
Moreover, thanks to the EU funding, we can afford to do good, high-quality equipment and, etc.
It was their goal, to bring it with the tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that we can address the things differently.
In the showbusiness often copied today one of the others.
It is on its way, logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer has usually is, of course, pity; that is, of course, only...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because there is no isolated and abandoned creatures are people with disabilities, which we would regret.
There are people who can live a full life and develop, as long as they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, this is a step forward, not only for themselves, but for the whole society.
It was also useful for this success, that you are a strong leader, as we hear from many people?
If you want to make something good, you can go in many things no compromises and demand must also be a certain degree of discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and then if you need to see that they have twice a week, complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm for many.
So it works, but everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
At present, the tap tap twenty members.
How many of them were from the very beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láa Angelovic.
We are an open group. The people come and go. We cannot prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate with us is always welcome.
20.12.2012 will take place on the day before the forecasts of doom, Thursday at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Ostrava / Plynojem; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to the final circuit via live with each other, and it sounds like a common interpretation of the anthem "world" of the band The tap tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled education center that is to be created under the name of STUDEO in the cost: 25 million CZK Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA and participated in the following years on several projects.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish workers with the space, but they do not always understand.
I would remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Kosmonautik."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André-Léonard Louis deer donated Prix rep Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the crater was named after him on the side of the moon erdabgewandten.
Already in 1925 a railway trolley was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is still not clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to slow down the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests.
But the research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 of ING appeared in the press on Rohozinski draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from passing by scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, however, his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other articles on the space appear after World War II, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is carried out in 1954 in the November issue of the journal, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to see that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 kilometers and come to use for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development has been stopped.
His successor in the first missiles of the type developed the Meteor missile was in the years of 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor missile had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of the meteor-2H and Meteor-3 have been built.
Also worth noting the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, is on the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national committee COSPAR.
Poland also participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos on space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on non-profit work.
This decision caused a lively discussion in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) there is tension.
Under this concept of a state is to understand, in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheaper goods in the economic competition, he offers the competition "to bring down a larger market share and to increase its profits.
In the large-scale, this means, for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy there, or to give up, but your business. The result is comparable to a high level of unemployment in countries with high labor costs.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily increased government spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and thereby to replace the overall social economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to reduce the social level of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide its own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is reflected in particular changes in applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of pay.
This is happening on the one hand, economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers' rights.
The results are growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
A few years ago in Germany there have been public food outlets for poor people, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected is in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which workers receive such a low wages, that the state needs to increase their income to the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal was revealed in the case of workers in the German Bundestag auxiliary staff.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU's southern states will no doubt on the state of the same amount, in which the people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels (as happened in the 19th century), or to languish for a pittance on the fringes of society, and to hope that it will eventually go private investment capital in the country.
Here, the question naturally arises as to where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of a country in the other; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at the employees' wages for a fraction of the European work.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not be involved with capital to its own economy, and that economy will lead to economic disaster.
The narrow-minded private capital insisting on his position that the state should not interfere in the economy.
But then we must ask whether the policy is not the private capital, and thus the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all Member States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual benefit, a legislation, in which everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable in practice.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department hires private lack of finances, dense with industrial companies with the drafting of bills.
These bills will be passed in the Bundestag.
Then all violence is no more of the people, as it is announcing the western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are currently in a situation where, as you Appian in his work to the crisis of the Roman Republic at times and describes: "the state was for a long time in the collapse, and the offices were filled with violence.
Grease money through illegal or fraudulent benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption has already grown incontinent, and the people went with bought votes on the election, "..." People with character applied for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul "..." You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine is an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man needs to be elected... "Appian thought while Pompey, but the strong man Caesar, who was then replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, as in ancient times today's society is based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without having to pay attention to societal interests.
The private capital is by its nature is not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, who are not in the least to in-depth reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we need to search in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state of affairs, the sinking of these regimes can be seen in favour of liberal democracies as some pause, during which the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, face in total ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work here is not the solution, or at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to put the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is more targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... That nothing comes from violence, or ever could," Sting sings in the song, which is the most important verse in the chorus: "... So that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons wanted no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild family's reputation, in 1849
According to the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with which the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about who in these recurring waves of killing Schuldiger and who is the victim; at the end of the day, today's residents of Israel were born, including the self-governing territories in the current political situation, and we have not seen the beginning of the violence itself.
It is a matter for me to open the readers to look behind the scenes look at who is 95 years voltage (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small country in the Middle East, in particular.
My thoughts are based partly on historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we will be able to make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were themselves, the specific steps, or whether someone was behind the throne, which drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the world's wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.
Under this astronomical rich families, which could be described as head of the Kraken (I do not know whether someone is still about them, but I do not agree with this) - the Rothschilds.
A great deal will not write about it.
Understandably,.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to prevent the connection of your name with high criminal, whose background is always to consolidate its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to these (before the raid on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the raid on Iraq, there were five countries, following the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia, in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has).
Anyone who has also always tries to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to give out during the civil war, its own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to give out their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis MC Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed due to the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global power lust of the Rothschilds resulted in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulating a plan to free three world wars by Albert pik, a Masonic of the 33rd, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war had to remove the target, the essence of Europe, by the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the global population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their facilities and their luxury and would also not consume so many resources) to create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up), and finally to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (Order from Chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the Fed's founding, so that crises such as the one you do not recur in 1907).
After it was able to resolve them by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the first world war, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian empire, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to the Second World War, the bankers could spark created by the policy, a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the condition deprived masses, so they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the culprits and simple solutions offered Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth columnists, and also to stir up the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as possible on the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain, which had initially kept the international bankers, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as by the war reparations against Germany was preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third world war.
If it is the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, similar to the Jewish people during the Second World War to the victims in the front line, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only of how to divide the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who was the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelites, where only unjust in an endless spiral of violence triggers, and at the beginning of the greed and their pursuit of global power?
Here we must distinguish between the people of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable, the international bankers loyal devoted politician, who is doing everything to stir up a war with Iran, which could in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly spread to a global conflict, and it could be because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies to the destruction of the world economy.
In the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "the only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every new-born babies at birth a chip implanted to subject of this nature of total control.
"And it is that small and large, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all the time on your right hand or on your forehead that nobody can buy or sell, he had the time, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, anyone who has understood the reasoning, the number of the animal.
It is a number of people, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. "
The film Argo: if Hollywood's worst call
In November 1979 a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release they called for the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the revolution in the United States, which had maintained over the decades, the patronage of his regime.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would have damaged confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position to put in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation made everything worse.
The captured diplomats have been freed after 444 days after negotiations were conveyed by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film director and actor Ben Affleck's Argo describes an episode of this story, which cost the US a small part of the victory.
Immediately prior to the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff managed to escape.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story to cover their true identity helped them - they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly disguised as members of a Filmstabes, who visited locations in the country for a science fiction movie.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation in Hollywood.
So the camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic, but at the same time a so-called "Bob Movie," i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks as, for example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
In the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically, and therefore come easily.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable start of his career.
From a losing has become a respected director, actor, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal ironic comments.
ARGO is his third film Gone Baby Gone, according to the playground (2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is not Afflecks first film, which plays in the Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that lifted the previous films of this director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense, but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. "
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story moves.
A similar effect achieved Affleck with his team, with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story is, in fact, not many people in the cinematic scenes.
He works with a few but quite successfully, although he sometimes helps the reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis averted at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway have contrived something).
The weakness of the ARGO is to have his too-wide spread, which is caused by the need to show too much to many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and that they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film loses traction. It is a movie that you can follow with some interest and approving the design and a thriller from the 1970s retro style.
However, he awakens enthusiasm is difficult.
As a reminder to a living piece of history until today in some way, and as proof, such as excessive, but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls annually a survey about the oddest bank charges, decided this year to hold the competition "absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea of recently brought to us by the EU's plan to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, compared to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women is located.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they represent a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"Further incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "Nacher said.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of ethanol fuel, which is in its follow-up naturschädigend, furthermore, banning mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because the eggs in this year have been much more expensive.
In the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in general are represented by one or more member countries (as the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to push through, with veto threat, the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not an "anomaly" exhibit.
The European Commission defended with the argument that they only harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have already been watered down by the EU against the opposition of some countries, with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU invoked an American study, which, in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious, cross-border raids at home
It is also relatively absurd - a directive that concerns the European officials themselves, everyone in the EU, which occupies an official function must not be used because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece, the name of Macedonia and instead must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks on the territory of a member country.
The EU set the Hoechstvolumen food stocks, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume set for fungal canned foods, and a large fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to ensure that they have no sea, or by the idea, however, to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU, "said in autumn 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and overcrowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases goods.
The Czech Republic as another way to ports, according to the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission was the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically, it should act to promote funding for the limits of money applications to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easy to the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus deserves to efficiency and development of the entire European Union according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, which were, however, imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member countries.
Emotions cause is the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other member countries in Brussels to fight for the right to use of specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic was able to defend after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvaružky, the residents (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but in our manufacturers have had to rename" Tuzemák. "
The name may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohorelice and Trebon, or even the more hops appear in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham.
With an EU trademark Pardubicer gingerbread or the Horicer breasts roles.
"The people that I want to save the republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how the idea to stand for the office of president?
It is not my intention to be a senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without any problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves, will be increased during the people, taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But when I see what I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things, rather than to run for senator or president.
They have succeeded in the Senate and then straight on the road to the castle.
They would not return to their voters back?
I told myself all the time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I made it and said that I am going to run for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate as possible.
However, the problem is not only that we rail as people in the pub, and in front of the TV, but anyone who wants to make the change.
The media who want to rob an honour, and confusing to lie the freedom of speech with freedom.
For example, has been said about me, that I would bribe journalists or that I was consultant from JIRÍ Paroubek.
We are talking about their visions.
The battle for the castle, they have taken with the idea of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million kroner.
To do this, you need to change the laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it will be rejected, and that keeps the population.
As an independent party I have a much greater potential to win support for all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party, which is the best for our country.
They see themselves as a human being in politics rather than right or left?
From the point of view of Czech, it seems to me that the people see me more to the left.
For me, this right left thinking, however, is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we can move forward.
For me, it is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right, I would like to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from, or from the Czech Republic, and I shall also speak against bad ideas.
It is not like you, if someone calls you as populists.
But they do not confirm what you have just said?
If you are a company in a business plan, then you also have an ideal destination and a vision.
And that you are approaching.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, already work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts.
But without support in Parliament keywords.
And so you come in the policy does not go far in the long term.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people who will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to implement these goals.
As President, there would be no problem for me, to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the raised would have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality, which points to abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was an achievement of the public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I just started and trying to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go back in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I am not alone; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with, for example, radim Jancura, which refused, however, due to overwork.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure any more.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, and those who are mostly gone, have elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are now only two independent.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and district of the main men.
You think about the creation of your own party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I don't have time to review the past every potential party member, and also do not have the money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
They talk of assets declarations, how would their?
I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu, which is worth about a million, and then I still have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was, in fact, a children's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was in the car drove, Galant to women and, at the same time, fought against evil.
Drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but they do not want to invest their own money.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I should make some debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
In fact, the cost of the campaign will be covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senator salary alone I could not live; so I could, for example, my son is not the English school funding, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
In other words, they remain more than entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will not cut back on these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have reduced some of my activities.
For example, my deputy in spring, CEO of the travel agencies.
The people want to see me as a Good Samaritan, which saves the Republic.
But I must do something.
They were accustomed to monthly income as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is to continue.
As President, I would put my activities, however.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is to see something interesting," says Verhaig, a Passantin on the roadside.
And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby says: "it is that house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet access, iPad and e-books.
No human being is voluntarily today in one of these old-style libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, sonderbarer record holder.
The 80,000 residents of community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
To curb this stupid circumstance, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general education and to build the seven bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the offensive.
And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to become the statistics: a library.
, winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took the matter with their usual serenity and appeared at the hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked nonplussed and wincing with the armpits, Esspecially Freche Maas his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and ended his speech with the words: "love an actionist founded municipality!"
In other words, that is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is dug up.
He is part of a revitalization project, which also include parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
So the faceless town retort that no longer had to offer so far as a post-modern pedestrian and an ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer.
Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: books Eldorado under glass.
There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and read the fußläufigen climb the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and well-structured, the ceramic Klinkerboden and elegant street speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It already holds for banking, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually way too expensive and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have asked the classic space configuration upside down and read the area from the inside to the outside world.
The interior of the books is cleverly used: in the middle of offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and headquarters are located.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are wall panelling, parapet, rose close countries.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the head.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a friesländischen farm of one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, is used in the Netherlands in glasshouses and fields a thin plastic woven as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins.
The fleece was pressed for the library - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, material that smells a little after new cars and a little after sports shoe.
After 105 steps one has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys will be rewarded in the literary cafe, not only with a fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, yes, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy.
Although the book is under a glass of fall, the sun itself seems just on sunny days in the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, which are across the glass facade, serve as shades and intercept a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry has already ventured to go the way of the new library.
Also Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, who described the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
In order to be filled the gaps in the still not fully stocked library - currently 70,000.
The concept is absorbed.
The shelves are filled to obenhin.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
MVRDV succeeded so that those who are called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
They also may be so young and uneducated.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a greater role,"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the motion of the Palestinians' observer status at the United Nations.
But then contained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Now Germany must be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
At the same time, however, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it comes to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy and away from a policy that has been gemanaged, so to speak, by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
Compounding that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The German is therefore find themselves between the fronts.
One expects from them that they play a more independent role, but not because they are accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It also shows the willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, in other words, the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful, the general public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not the head.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to attach too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, it has abstained in important decisions, such as when the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will play a certain amount of respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests are taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
By contrast, the United States have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Due to the American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
However, due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly.
I believe that the real differences are not so big, as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Germany find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead must push things from their own position.
Just make it with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
The lead or Germany is still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to the fact that the country is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role in a wide variety of anti-German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like it, and there is still a lot more unpopular makes it - c'est la vie!

"" trademark protection in China: if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind an officially registered designation in China, which has nothing to do with the company, however, hides.
However, as long as they do not accuse protection, such as the actual name.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Patt hole, lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The other countries have indicated a few additional letters enough so that they are not allowed to register their brands.
Lu Gucci, Prada will simply enter from Gucci, Prada-Kny.
German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Stand-off hole opens up a folder with entries of the PCT in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company, the trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are the world champions in copying and the injured intellectual property rights, is well known.
In the large cities there are stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
But Pattlochs cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This means that women are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"This is, we must fight it," calls for stand-off hole.
"The brand will be diluted, which disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion in the year of the third-largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But DELETION dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the process can drag, with an uncertain end.
Reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because the name was rejected after the long duration of the "market has become a reality."
If the plaintiff misfortune, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump.
The Chinese must therefore today use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue and white logo, which reminded BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would look at the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
In the past year, but it was returned by the "emergency in the workflow to normality."
So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was decreased by 22 percent.
You almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, are still waiting in the office 81.500 appeals to carry out.
It costs a lot to deal
As so often happens in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications were CTMO on trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It was a record and means that China for the 10th time in a row, the list of new registrations in all over the world, who shares with authority.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges.
This means that any simplified registration costs, on average, 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs a lot to go against it, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years ago, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
It is true that the Germans have been able to achieve its illegal manufacturing imitierter motor vehicle parts was dug.
But the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
We have failed to do that, because in Germany family names could not be protected, hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical says in Munich.
Indeed, the trademark office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.
We must be careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "this process is extremely time-consuming and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly figure, the company archives have seen even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to the settlement.
"You can see how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are threatening to spread to Europe.
Then, when there will secure unprotected brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the Council's lawyer stalemate hole German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It was not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should register "everything which is somehow deserving, as well as in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, in the last act: if Freudenberg under his trademark drama, then we would have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed into the segment in question from the market.
World AIDS Day: noise, singing, help
The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg imbongi - and AIDS orphans in Swaziland rejoice.
The story of a connection that transcends far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the plan: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then press the voices of the singers - old, bass, tenor and soprano, and track.
The 29-year-old conductor, and Fiete Hopf, it almost highlights from his shoes, if he brings together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg rehearsing the choir imbongi a new song.
Fifty singers and singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin up to the house.
"OM Obani is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and that even in a very foreign language: Zulu, which will be from 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and spoken in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million infected with HIV, which estimates Unaids, the program of the United Nations for the use of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa found in Germany.
70 of them attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the children's school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily in the gogo Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or even Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently speak can sing, but no one in this area.
For almost ten years ago, the choir songs in this foreign language and also brings you and then back to where it was originally: in the south of Africa.
8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Around 2000 people living there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a majority of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents, because they are prey to HIV.
In Esitjeni worldwide, according to UNICEF is reflected in the small, Swaziland suffers from the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy.
Circumcision of male foreskin, which reduce the risk of infection can be proven to be adopted by the half of the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland Immunschwäche virus to die with mid-thirty is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, it is not only those who lack of parental responsibility, but simply: food, clothing, education.
No school has no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private individual to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the association "Voices for Africa," which cares professionally since almost to the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni founded the choir.
Facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and Tripper ().
Frequent viral STI HIV, humane Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Crab and itch are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main parties concerned?
Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
The heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexuals adults comparatively small - yet: around 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other populations.
According to European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years ago.
Here are also often humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 at 3698 diseases more than doubled in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to a sexual disease?
The infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, as well as complaints urinated, flow, Unterbauchschmerzen vesicles or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100 percent protection.
Partly because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend especially frequently changing sex partners regular check-ups.
Most of the STI diagnosed early can be cured and avoid late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fees that ersingt the choir in Germany, CosmoCode yields.
"We have already sent a total of about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini manages, a self-conscious and assert strong woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about is that the orphans, at one of the grandmothers.
The gogos, as it is called, the old women in Zulu, who are based in the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, will give you a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear every day just in time for the school.
Anyone who has any more, comes into the house to Khanyisile, a single woman, who will be paid by the association as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa," a Nähschule in life, built two Hühnerhäuser and organized jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI that many people in the village of an HIV test.
It is not self-evident, because it is so obviously the disease throughout the country, it is silent on the dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," Annette Lennartz says, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.
Sub-Saharan Africa, the last absolute monarch, King Mswati III is well-known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
It is also, among other things, this state-sanctioned form of life due to the fact that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms there at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but that hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the imbongi choir every two or three years, together with the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many know at the southern tip of the black continent from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white, sing the songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but it has also been abgetrotzt some fierce border soldiers a few tears.
The journey will continue Esitjeni, where the singer visit your godchildren.
Even if you have the small village on maps, takes place in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than well-known.
"After Esitjeni, because it is light," said the people who live there.
And when you return the 8733 airline to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Strasse, then you can see it here.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there are Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice may be up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science."
The Messenger probe have found evidence that there is an ice in the region permanently in the shadow of the planet.
They should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that are taken on the Mercury.
But nobody put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, to explore the depths of space.
From time to time you send images to Earth: small holes in infinite reaches of the universe.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers have developed by the Max Planck Institute.

The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius Trifid fog.
The name is derived from the Latin word trifidus Trifid (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), because dark dust strip dreiteilen the fervent heart of the birthplace of stars.
In the constellation snake-makers have astronomers photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carom: 400 million light years from Earth, the seeds of two galaxies verschmelzender each other and will inevitably clash with each other.

Our insight into all: the most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei set up a year later to the star observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights that they deliver, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It looks to be in the same all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Construction: the telescope is ground to a halt in his elevation - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light gathering force.
This is enough - despite the comparatively low mirror diameter - the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
"In the" search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by putting more computing power available.
Overlooking the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which makes his name.
With a total of four reflect the telescope will be able to shine in the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum.
Also on the Chilean observatory was NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is being planned.
Its main mirror should include whopping 42 meters - and will be set from nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
But with the images until at least 2018 is to be expected.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
They offer two levels with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, along with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea is intended to create a new, huge telescope, with an average of 30 meters.
It is here to gaze on an illustration.
However, the main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble supplies.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the search for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
In the picture, the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at the earliest 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: there are looking for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice on the south pole of the Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Daily drinking butter - and 168-year-old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people achieve a high level of age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan to achieve a high level of age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The trip through the Talysch Mountains is to name wild romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one might think that being in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, which borders with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Aserisch and is very durable.
The terminal is Lerik.
The small town flaunts to powerfully meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Lerik Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the vehicle to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago, a children's shows
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region, and he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years ago, he is said to have a daughter.
So has irali Müslümov charged at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also striking many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation no scientific proof to bring about the age, given that person was missing.
Every day, melted butter becherweise
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly live here in the south?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the food.
But that it is precisely the kalorienreiche Talyschen should be as healthy, especially the love meat, bread and milk products, many of which have daily drinking a glass of melted butter, from a nutritional point of view, not just seems plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years for this is still relatively young.
And 143 descendants Mirzayeva, which claims to have lived in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground back and forth rolls with butter, which you worked tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are grandparents.
Two infants also jump around.
In the kitchen, preparing the tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly under her headscarf conceals a long, dark blond braids, which reveals her son proudly in front of us.
I washed my hair with milk, so you never went out and retained their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
She has always eat only what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the most serious in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyev Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, which will drive the father figure of the nation, ruled his country like a dictator knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, and later his son, Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no emergency, Azerbaijan's old.
Mirzayeva, 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) per month as a pension, a sum for local conditions, from which you can live well.
And perhaps has also long been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "the old enjoy in our culture."
They are living in the midst of the large family, are loved, and are happy.
If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo seems to be the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president with pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds, it is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was aimed at the whole nation, but, above all, to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because they have all been hopelessly in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He did so, said Mohamed Morsi almost excuse the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and its powers expanded, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate of the American University of Southern California, save really wants the Egyptians, the world is not entirely in the clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt, partial worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the law on the principles "Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
It was, and is, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will take advantage of the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least that sets a new article hinzugeführter close: in all matters relating to the Sharia al-Azhar University should be held to the rate, the most important Islamic institution in the country, with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
This is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would lead to the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the interpretation is Verfassunsgsentwurf
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also protect, as it is in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morals and values. "
This is legally formulated so blurred that state institutions could control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English that means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, there is no article stipulates equality between men and women.
It bans or another to insult the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to slander.
But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the wording, the "insulting people," was banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurist?
Morsi interpretation, like so much in the draft, which will be presented before the signature and according to his words, "very soon," the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution is back,"
The opposition formed for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the charter to fall, even before they can enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said, the draft Constitution "belong to the scrapheap of history."
He accused via short message service Twitter followers Morsi to want to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren has yet to be paid," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced, do not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution,"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew on the counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile river in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and cried: "the people calling for the application of the law of God."
They demanded by Morsi: "don't use the country!" And promised: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, had summoned warlike conditions.
This obviously did not want to risk Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood said, both the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to be decided, the people at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word 'human rights does not happen again,"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or were in court.
For him, not because he would be part of their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is the word 'human rights, not even in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi power to extend all three powers in the state had resigned the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of having to strengthen civil society, you have the president," de facto suspended Saeda complained.
But without civil society organisations could be a democracy does not work.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which sees the ideological direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
It could be revenge.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of the country's success might have something to do with the local appetite rather nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And they leave a week.
So you have to imagine the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, depending on how you would like to have his fish stink - up to one year in water.
When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians flock to a very hard here in Fagernes, that is, well, complete with specialty.
"You eat it raw and provides it with an aquavit," Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but also as a so-called "rakfisk General," says the festival.
People eat small fish cubes and make a large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Harvard.
The liquor can crowd out the smell.
I cost some hors d'oeuvres.
If one is to bring the rakfisk near the nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which has a long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and soaked fish in autumn in airtight salt water casks.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed.
A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was still not too long ago, much richer than Norway, immigrants flows.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway often failed in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here are still hates it, to name Anders Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 last year, men, women and children.
Instead, it only applies to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
It is held responsible for today's wealth in Norway since the early 1970's growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us," said Anna, our waitress, which distributes round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says.
We are a people - as they say - need to be careful.
Your English is exactly like that of most of the people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As with all money raised in the years up to the global economic crisis, which they had not, Norway, held its purse firmly closed.
"As long as we can go in winter, skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, rakfisk eating," she adds with hearted laughter.
I am in the snow and instead of me for another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
Such a moose burgers is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes wonderful to me.
But on the evening of the stink fish on the menu is once again.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests at the vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to one, with fly dressed show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What have ye up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard."
They applauded and laughed.
A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit.
But perhaps it is, but the severity of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to his office, he wants to grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring built from steel, blocking off several major transport routes in the capital and on the roads for chaos.
The goal, however, it was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters trying to reach Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week the U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, which we will be able to achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was working as governor of his home state Mexico.
In this densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered, for example, would like to him.
Residents of the resort to write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can ride on one of the highways, Pena Nieto, who represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets that were once again.
With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes" to him, his friend and political ally Gabriel LAX Nietos Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years out of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view on their former governor.
Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be greater on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden under highway on guided tours and represents, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems are in the municipality of urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a wasteland in the vicinity of a large landfill sites the corpses of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto Mexico have been murdered in the state of more than 1,000 women - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure, to say the least.
But, in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical for the run-down district, fights Irinea Buendia with the tears when they showed me photos of their deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at their home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body had already used.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross, which bears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, you have denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me when I was a humbug, troublemakers, whingers.
You just want that we accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto Präsidentenbinde on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to care during his tenure to this problem.
"I hope that, as president, he is so, as he was as a governor," says the PRI Congressman LAX in Valle del Bravo.
But it is precisely be afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.
The public prosecutor's office claims: Bradley Manning was not complaining about mistreatment
The public prosecutor's office is contrary to Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing dealt with Mannings time in the military prison in Theodore Roosevelt, Virginia
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges due to harsh prison conditions
The US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The public prosecutor's office has tried to be noted on Friday that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning failed - accused of the largest leak of confidential information of American history - several opportunities to complain about the abuse suffered by him in military detention.
In a cross-examination Mannings: during a hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland said maj. Ashden fine that documents to weekly visits to the prison officers during Mannings prison time in Theodore Roosevelt, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defense to the rejection of the charges - manning had been punished by the harsh prison time already had enough - manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen during his term of service in Iraq thousands of confidential documents.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, with Manning went through the forms, which had filled officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Militärgefängnis, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011, increased detention conditions.
The officials were manning questions and his answers.
When interviewed him on Friday to the forms, manning admitted that he assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by setting up a total of as "very professional."
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had consulted manning directly to his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns to express orally, and officials have discussed this with him, and to deal with them. They were not, however, be logged.
"They wrote (concerns)," "no problems, and that is not necessarily meant that I said nothing," manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning, asked why he has not complained about his treatment, when he met with a committee in January 2011, which should investigate the mentioned to him a few months earlier on a form suicide thoughts.
During this meeting, Manning replied that his intention to downgrade consisted to allow its observation status of "prevention of injury."
The military said it did this restrictive status - which is assigned to a level below the suicide risk - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good to me, and the observation status on the prevention of injury get rid of (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months, before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base in Virginia.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and was due to the heat even unconscious.
Not to be aware of what is happening with him, or in the outside world, was burden.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, manning on this cage," he said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to Theodore Roosevelt, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without any society.
We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to remain in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep, or even just to establish.
He was always have to sleep with light, which from the outside in his cell.
When he turned up at night, and his face no longer guards were able to see him, so he turns back again.
In January 2011 Mannings Mannings lawyer formally objecting to the treatment.
In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Theodore Roosevelt and are counting on a morning naked before guards and other prisoners.
During this census Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover themselves with its ceiling.
In the survey on Friday manning that he had concluded from a command of his guard, that he should leave the ceiling, with which he could cover, he admitted, however, that no one had asked him.
Manning had testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked in the previous night, he would have been tried before, to show an official that he poses no danger to themselves.
Manning told the officials, he would have been able to use the federal his underwear or his flip-flops, in order to injure themselves, but has not done so.
That night, so manning said his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will consider reducing his prison experiences and at least be drastically, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will commit less crime, while others will be contested charges, which are considered too extreme.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. From the public prosecutor's office is expected to be a justification of the detention conditions.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules that apply to all under the highest safety precautions in Theodore Roosevelt under prisoners.
The charges against Manning include the benefits of the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty on all counts, threatened him a life sentence.
My Mexican American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave due to the lack of opportunities, Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette is of the opinion that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as the helplessness in me.
Signs point to two queues: one for "" ("Mexican"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my life has been referred to as "Mexican."
An ethnic shortcuts - exactly what my friends in Boston "Irish" or "my friends in New York," an Italian name.
Later, I decided for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to say to me in this language at both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent I will also not meaningless.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about those Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto moment this week, when the future visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as most likely to remain in Mexico, rather than in the United States.
He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc modelled in the European Union.
Mexico's Pena Nieto vowed to continue to wage the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848, fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event should not be overlooked.
As soon as a US government official criticism of Mexico, you can hear - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas go on the warpath.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about feelings of resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people Mexican origin living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, lies in the fact that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents emigrated part - got no chance in Mexico and in the north.
And, in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now living the American dream, have visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, which we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes blurred, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial, a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families would not have failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would see us now is not behind the silk curtain caught - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who you are - and Mexican Americans.
While it is in American citizen, she sees itself as a part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How should I learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to take their links to the diaspora.
Mexican Americans want to set up a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, such as a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And, given the unequal income distribution, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I am afraid, because you need alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
It can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to be such a hope to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame were countless buildings to rubble and ash, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time, rockets are taken from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although both Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - both Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end.
A war, which will neither lost nor gained
At first glance, seems to be optimistic in the face of the current situation anything other than appropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November persists, the this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
Since 2007, the leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group saw large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that you have the time on their side.
So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to take powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, Israel's closest Muslim ally, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as has taken for Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren could face the Stürzung Bashar's, up to Jordan, where hamas- allies are threatening the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on People's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, which can not be wooed by Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, leave the opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a military threat.
The Israeli anti-missile system, "Iron Dome" has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israel will be able to sleep, at least for a while.
In diplomatic terms, the United States hold firm on its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remain, not least thanks to the closed plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state to protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, however, continue to be developed.
Netanyahu is well in the run-up to the election on 22 January his Likud party has allied itself with Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren group.
This is why cuddled scheming Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
In fact, if you have control over the West Bank, then they would not like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip to fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them in check and punish those behind the wall, you should dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry, but the Arab Spring could make you a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries on the seat of power, have little left for Israel, you will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments in the repair of its economy.
Indeed, that is the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world, taking tentative steps in the direction of democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt someday explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to the suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demand over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is, those who will be represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and from this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes.
The small - for the near future, the hope is that the cease-fire outsiders grants more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by trade and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more than for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for a UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play its part to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if it were a reluctant participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single entry into force cigarette packaging
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This brand logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are also printed with dramatic images, which show sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick babies and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images onward Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in small letters.
Australia will introduce the world's strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking, the glamorous image of tobacco will be eliminated.
This is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% under likely will start no longer afterwards.
"You can see children young age, that they are trying to understand the message to promote the tobacco companies with their brand image," federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, the changes will impact, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby hard fought against the law.
So it was with the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra hectares of Zico, import Pty Ltd, a small family-run company notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone cap has risen to cover the unbearable packaging, since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the law.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale shops and waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, is located in the popularity of social media in precisely the population group, to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, it is prohibited to act as a sport no longer sponsors and forced most of the traders to put cigarettes in shops. The tobacco advertising is switched on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who sells tobacco, and only a small area to promote its products, is not around to the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researchers in the public health at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noticed an increase in reports of experience to brands, which have been written by "ordinary people."
The question must be asked: is this just a private person, which is so great favours at Marlboro cigarettes, that it takes a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry, rather than focusing on marketing, dealing with the new laws.
She has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, though none of the countries has increased trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which wrote photographic warnings.
Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are under consideration in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers defiantly show.
The images will not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"It is simply a dump, and the box," says Victor el Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumour.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, "King of the pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging have complicated stacking shelves.
"In the past, I have to sort needs an hour to a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government would have to ban cigarettes - then we would have said OK, that's it, we make," he adds.
In a constantly elektrisierten world it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait on another plane.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait for a half day at the airport on a flight, it is quite - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to you, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting idea, which may promote the creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on one or the other screen staring us no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom.
In other words, we should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls adorned a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that want to exercise than the experience, "a satisfactory activity, but it will not be able to define themselves."
Boredom differs from apathy to the effect that the person is not working, but would like to be.
When the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something about it.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of the process of attention, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be seen in the context of bored people, the problem in their area, or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that it is boring to us, even if we are just struggling to focus.
In their study, "The unengaged Mind: defining boredom in terms of Attention": "the idle minds: the definition of boredom under the aspect of attention," which was published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants heard a tape, on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the adjacent space that has nothing to do with the content of others had heard it on low volume, so that it was almost imperceptible, while the third group to hear these sounds not at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television, to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they have had problems to focus, and could find no reason for this to their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said.
On the other hand, if you put a monotonous activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor, music can distract and help to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.
"Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particular film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a "scale of boredom vulnerability."
On the scale statements such as "a lot of things that I have to do, and repeated are monotonous," and "I have so many interests, that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - in particular, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human development and gemeinwesen conducted at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do homework, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen in terms of boredom or declined.
However, he was sure that "the youth will be perceived as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drugs to relieve them - that have shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, which explored the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain would like to say that we should do something different," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what you should just do best.
If there is a boring and one of these energy used to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide short-term for heaven, but in the long term they evaporate again.
So who his bored children an iPad, it is enough to distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "self-control of a situation on the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas will receive more self-control.
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
We should also see them not to be critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel us away from the constant activity and Technologieberieselung well.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only after a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, even if the noise is silent."
In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before the court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, had been summoned for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a fine of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But he is also one?
To legalize marijuana in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offences less by the law, rather than from the site.
Hundreds of Administrative Offences, which revolve around marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, has already approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession of small dimensions. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that pursuing existing marijuana offences and people are still quoting in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J., the police chief in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratching perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline on 1 December 2013 before our eyes.
In Washington there is of the opinion that Colorado is, in any case, most of the states with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes, and then to the own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state therefore well suited to the orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that there is no place or system can do more to serve as, in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502 enters into force on 6 December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system is not yet exist, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be resolved at this time - for example, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the ban on the use of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare.
"Nowhere, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal, "a recently formed research group says.
On 21 November chief sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years ago, and that the police "immediately" will strive for any prosecutions for these offences.
Chief added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorados district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he gave his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams of marijuana or less accountable in court, even though many have been indicted for other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue violations, where they were at the time for crimes," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of no longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided to do so, not all outstanding procedures.
"I do not believe that I don't waste my time to implement the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
District prosecutors if it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants in court for marijuana offences and local acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for criminal that you can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states, such as alcohol, the smaller quantities of marijuana, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also waiting nervously on the instructions of the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give.
Despite several arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik adviser to the Obama administration is of the view that investigators are likely to enter any doors, to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, state-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado don't wait for the fact that the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, even though they could open up until about a year ago.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level, a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative change.
Then we decided, for what the community and not afterwards, for which the state has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
Today, not only university students to be attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once held for the world's largest stamp, for a modern Greek symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said, I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with the fact that students in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author A N Wilson said Haydn, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had harassed me only for one reason - a reason, which seemed in this so-called cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatchers and I advocate in the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to the latest reports is suffering from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred on the Tory students in Oxford has gained such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection, who is gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they are often due to their political views, "active in isolation, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
They are calling for ensuring a place in the Equality Committee of the college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis represented.
It shows an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce was, among other things, and with silver suit and silver occupied floor protzte.
Conservative students at other universities say they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend at universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon club without having to have met us at all. "
In Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent, who initiated the request for greater protection is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that they have observed in JCR members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
When I was incredibly shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education, not an honorary title.
The atmosphere would be even Stalinisten on terror.
In the first days of the current week, the new students learn more about themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even with the joys attended it.
Political issues, such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century English. On what should happen, I was not been taken.
", Miss Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased)," please translate the first paragraph. "
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are simply stupid?," he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Tears in my eyes on wallten.
"I suggest that you do in your free time, a couple of hours - in other words, if they are not too concerned with their social activities are," Pitt gave vent to me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
On this evening, I sat in the college alone at dinner, when someone typed me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore, it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to adjust to me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects.
This should prove to be unsuccessful.
A study in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, as a conservative force Eton College had visited, said to me: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As Tories have sex?" One asked me.
Each other?
I felt so, such as homosexuals in front of the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt like.
I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would be able to meet like-minded after collapse of darkness?
I should have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were in front of me, extended before my mind to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, which was open to identify themselves as Tory, Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had discussed Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and to write speeches for you.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic-fascist history perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at the BMP Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said to me.
I started to commuting between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties were accepted all the political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
You would never do such a thing, not in my city of the tower.
Even my friends always impeccable manners on the day.
His wet eyes marred.
Give me a chance.
I am sure that you can only neckt.
It would break my heart if you.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and Renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another Geschichtstutor claims seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I zerging secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing," and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who suggested the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and my Häscher gave up after five minutes.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen tail.
But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even worse is that it was a University of Oxford, which spawned not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is far behind a reputation of equality and freedom of thought hidden.
"Valentino prefers elegance of the celebrity '
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture," acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 clothes of haute couture has been compiled, which were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history can be written, whose only protagonist "Il Signore" Garavani, which would not, however, without his clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stifling and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be seen until the March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the aristocracy, from the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita Salimah Aga Khan and the princess of England, up to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows this personal memories as trophies of his social ascent of the modest fashion-maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be a disadvantage.
"At least not on your carpet, as it is doing some beautiful celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all of us, when we were invited in his house in Gstaad," the former wife of Marella Agnelli, "" Thyssen, closely with forgotten beauties such as or Eugenie Niarchos explains.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria, in a dress from Valentino
Not even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the Modemachers.
Many years ago, we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music and you felt his influence.
"All invited to feel important and loved," the "Top Model," which began her career in the week of the couture in Paris in 1995 remembers.
"He never goes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she says finally.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is no history of Versessenheit, rather than mutual Business as Usual.
He may be people with a good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60 meters long catwalk, which proposes a role: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk, in order to admire a beautiful "Audience," which masterpieces of Valentino, such as, for example, the dress, the Jackie Kennedy chose for their wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes, the Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls names such as the Sibilla de Luxemburgo rays, Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion-maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him all the others because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty," the ex-Duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors, which he uses; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg cannot forget the first time, when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of the age, and to have the opportunity to wear one of his dresses...
At the end of the 1990s there was then.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a bodice with a neckline that makes his name.
"It was a dream realized," says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg.
"Valentino depends not of fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratin, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d Arenberg kept their dresses of Modemachers "with the utmost care," not only because a dress is a dress, but also the related memories. "
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for your wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion-maker called his) were necessary in order to make this Ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy signature style even when grunge, the highest authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the top of society."
For years, with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce Cavaliere del Lavoro (Italy), the highest award, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Bocuse d'Or, added Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I have noticed always be refinement, his calm, to be perfect," d Arenberg admits.
I've seen him the last time before a month ago, at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four million to the winner of the Indonesian volcano your life and your health at risk if you have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and other work word for word in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must rise every day, down to the bottom of the crater, where the gas out of the ground advance sulphur entrenched in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large stones, which can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the stone paths.
Although there are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the need for more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they need to keep the balance and put their cautious steps, so that they are not slipping and crash.
You know that each step can cost lives, as a French tourist, who crashed a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miner from Kawah Ijen 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they dismantle.
The path between the tourists who shoot like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales that a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 metres
The company is PT Ngrimbi, which uses since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and never (better) said its workers, which pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and used in the manufacture of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we are usually 70 kg, we will receive for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million)," Anto, which normally three routes a day explained to us.
For each route he needs three hours that he is completely done, but at the end of the day, he then 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an inhuman effort, but it is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miner here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) will be paid at the coffee harvest a day, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 million) is very high," said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer explained on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto since three years of his life at the Kawah Ijen to play, whose sulphur when he left the first tracks, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I am going to work here two years ago, because I would like to invite you to make or to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but could work as a tourist guide of the life gestrafte young man, waiters or at the reception of the hotel, but instead he performed the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands at two o'clock every morning, because the sulphur coming out at night, where its characteristic yellow shines in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, he rises in the light of a small headlamps on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, in the crater.
About 400 on Kraterboden baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized, in order to save costs, and the media, the work on their own account and will be paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get no share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) charge per camera, which the guardians of this nature parks demand, together with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) from the tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and human donkeys.
"This work is for the animals, and not for the people," Madrusin, an alert, 42-year-old carrier, which operates three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen protested.
He is in a position to contribute up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as there is" because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years old.
I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the eyes, throat and itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers in the thick pillars sticking up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... Of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, Arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders of the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years used to be able to contribute 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which will be transported by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in the absence of some teeth.
The oldest of his five children with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur-makers.
Time passes, but the meagreness generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore babies needed to rescue the economy
The Stamford put the blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, thou art my patriotic duty wife: we meet our citizens, and we are creating life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising Minzbonbons, but - or precisely for that reason - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "will be a" Bao "(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has shot the video preserves the hope that the commercial funny manner, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to perform their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, which is why we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, and that is why we realized that this is an issue that we had to look into the matter.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirting with Pheromonen or the organization of speed dating evenings (quickly).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore, we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Every year, there are 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-technology city-state in south-east Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Stamford more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was partly due to a "better training" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social realities have contributed to the higher number of alone, and the delay marriage and birth rate, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to tackle on a surge in immigration in order to reduce the population to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are critical to ensure that they do not keep wages low and integrate.
The increase in the number of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on the economy of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore has also shown unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are not built.
She also has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large apartment for families.
However, Lim yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that you are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards wanted to give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is to take the talks with the Singapurern, the work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"People are highly stressed that housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old man.
Men and women have their careers, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons that you can have no children.
That is why the Stamford have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
The offline offline private is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, we are dealing with the private property, or "areas of private life, where one has the right to protection against any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under 16 years?
As this definition will be applied to his everyday life and the social networks?
He understands the dangers to which he is, if he is well-known in the Internet situations, which he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years ago, which are often in the Net.
In four of the cases they tied the concept with "something very private," on a personal level, and "on the password and user" if you apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office," says the 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may not know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
FB I upload pictures or pictures of the game.
I am also distributes my time with well-known.
"I would be part of a photo that is not of me, or from someone who makes the stupid," he says.
The boy is well aware that it is wrong to write, publish obscene photos of naked, of crimes, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most are related.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.
I am reported on Twitter, to put myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know whether someone answers, I invite you," he added.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives or friends in the distance," he says.
He replies that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone foreign empfähle, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ASK ASK, he admits, 20 of the people not to know that he has attached his friend list.
"It frightens me, not because we have something in common, for example, music," he indicates.
After giving the boy has made him no allusions or asked him after his address or telephone number.
"If somebody harassed me or they demanded of me, I simply remove him from my account," he admits.
José reported, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experience, which is known today as a cyber-bullying.
The well-known girlfriend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José the victim has not closed the account.
"He has only made it private."
He then outlined a series of steps to configure a user account.
In contrast to Jorge this boy would upload photos of well-known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, that is what I would do if I dislike him or he is one thing I want to wipe out.
"But I know that this is cyber-bullying," he explains.
Key issues
For example, Marielos Porras, teachers in English with a university degree in education and learning believes that are understood to be the children and young people, that it is the purpose of social networks, to inform.
"The Internet as a medium for the search for information; however, with the release of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she says.
Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of "digital natives and immigrants," these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, which is supposed to teach them, where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria, which must be distributed, published or said, and that in an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky about who, if it is to think the most important thing to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is to provide you with questions, which brings you to reflect.
"To say to you, you should not do it, do not work," he says.
Porras then called a number of possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why do you find it on the Internet?
Or: would you, if you published a photo of you, such as that which thou hast published by a friend?
You know what the other post about you?
If you have other people asked for permission in advance, if thou hast labelled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: all need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online, as they do offline.
There are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that the parents read carefully the directives of the social networks.
If you understand all the sections, you have a solid foundations, in order to talk with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one account on the Internet.
"Old age, for example, or what one part or publish," he said.
According to the children need to be reminded of the lesson, "Thou shalt not speak with strangers."
Conclusion of the summit of Unasur without the publication of the Declaration of Lima
The sixth summit of the presidents of UNASUR ended today in Peru, in theory, without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and signed by the seven leaders should be present.
San FRANCISCO repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government leaders of the Unasur. Sources in the Heads of State and President firm initially told that they would be handed over to it after the examination, said, however, that it would be published for some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
If you have any questions about the text, you said that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was set out in brief statements to the press.
The journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, the image of the president meeting without sound with the message "private meeting, limited audio," was in the press room.
The few details that among journalists have been received by the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document, which was widespread during the day, the list of participating presidents, eliciting the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media unease, which was called for more information.
After that, the media, the president of Peru, sent an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but the statement by Humala and not the official document to the conclusion of the summit.
In October Peru was host of the Third Summit South America - Arab states (Aspa), and also on this occasion was despite emphatic invitation by the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had been announced in advance, nor published.
On the official website of the Aspa can convince themselves that the document was published on Tuesday.
Two international meetings on the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for the journalists would be available, but in a highly restricted access to the information.
The summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, a ruling of the European Court of Justice in The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which is beginning to hear Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima launched against Santiago, the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow the verdict on the differences that we are currently before the International Court of Justice, and run," said Humala, along with his Chilean.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that abides by the international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and the international courts subjects," Piñera adds and largest Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ, after Colombia raised after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it had deemed a serious mistake, legal action against the agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to submit to the International Court of Justice judgments.
Present at the summit, the president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
In 2011, Paraguay, which has been ruled out after the removal of its president Fernando Lugo of the Unasur participated in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit in Lima shortly after lunch time.
The head of state was reading out the final document, which said that 16 decisions have been taken and set out the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur "take significant steps in the direction of the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to improve "the cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and against organised, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively."
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant trains, but intended to expand our production capacity and to show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 flagship projects, which is intended to improve the spatial connections in South America, and particularly in rural and border areas... And thus combine our countries and open up new forms of economy," the Peruvian president said in a statement read.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, who were on the horizontal axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption" of the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for that Latin America continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace, and with good neighbourly relations remains, was another aspect, which was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meetings, that he was in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his vis-à-vis of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to deal with the maritime conflict after one of Bogota in question ruling of the ICJ respectfully.
"Maybe I will be meeting tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua to make necessary talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega, that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defense ministers of the block to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened in terms of the defence of the region also met in the run-up.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the presidents of UNASUR, which took place in Peru in Lima said on state television that the Europeans' in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing "and" are now virtually a fatherland. "
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which push the Member States of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there are still reactionary sectors that strive for a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who never commit to something, and in return, we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights headquartered in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he did not regret this decision, because it does not betray his principles, but also fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was "justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not complied with procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to subject him an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sex, while "the Swedish law, which allows via a video conference on the Embassy of Ecuador in London could be carried out."
Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since it is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the leader in Ecuador.
However, there is the danger that he treated physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space, and no physical exercises in the open air could carry out.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, the granting of a letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that it would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities Europe's, he stressed that there have been talks with London, I have to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, this word, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
This morning, "when Britain granted carte blanche, this is done, in my opinion."
And if Sweden verhörte Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or via Skype, as it was to be the Swedish law and made in other cases, the problem was resolved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the malicious intent and the lie that weaken the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the most evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who aspire to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is not more of these journalists, "and also not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewers bourgeois" countries, and it is anticipated that he will deepen in a re-election, "the revolution, and pursue the path in the right direction."
Correa also supported maintaining the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain "hard and instead give any opportunism and no legal coup d'etat," because the legitimacy of democracy has been "destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the privileged maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries to negotiate, for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, to call international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
In terms of the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in order, he stated that he sees this possibility, "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he would lose the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had to believe that I was guaranteed that likely victory, which is why I must comply with this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, then I would like to withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is crucial," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba once again after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse into the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took part in Lima today on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, which ended with a call for greater regional integration, to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of a dying of AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they were the result of the investigation confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success, "tried to weaken."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, a few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time it avoided even the director of a clinic of IMSS, to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
Then AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people are still in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and the immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, i.e. the emergence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients, which absorbs the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," the head of the HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, but he said that this information was based in April of this year from a respected scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those would have greater opportunities, which are not drug addiction: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that anyone who gets in the age of 25 years ago, the diagnosis HIV-positive, in this sense, "can easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control," the expert said.
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has reduced significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who are dying of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died since the release of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is a universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- so why people are still dying out?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they do not know their condition, i.e., in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all the people, where it is needed, need to be offered screening tests."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de si del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who had to carry out its test at a private laboratory, and this is the only reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS phase, and even the Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then three more times," says one in my case.
The change was to improve the, well, I am ernähre practise sport and take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work a lot, but I have an active, responsible sex life, I am on my health and the other person," Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, to encourage those who with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS Day afraid.
You should make the test, if they belong to the risk group, the sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how you can live like all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the cause of HIV said.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past, they were made separately, now you give us with hundreds of packages, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk of new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" Is a question of widespread derision by social workers, guidance personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, who did not want to expose young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality looks; it is best, the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen nationally on 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in terms of HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there is a case for every registered 4 or 5 persons who do not know it.
After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling, which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the group, which has been achieved over a bankrupt trade in Mexico, a pernicious precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country will be created, the payment problems.
One could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment on 15 June handed down by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale leads for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, in order to call for tripartite inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges of the matter indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans first says that it is the main proceedings in Mexico to the trade deals with bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedures in the case of default of companies is not known with länderübergreifendem profile.
Indeed, for this purpose, the model law was created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, but the American Law Institute has been used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling states that it is not the majority required for the restructuring of the debt would be without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation, which had branches of vitro with its parent company, has been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Indeed, it is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and comercial, whose liabilities have been confirmed, the group companies from the Instituto Federal de (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies).
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
This will not be taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there are blamed for his difficult situation from 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
This is why the Gonzalez Sada family before the same court sets a contradiction, so that the vote will take place in plenary, i.e., of all the judges, because only three of them were voting.
It will not be granted, will be the Cerciorare appeal, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the court had set aside a document, which was sent by an amicus curiae (friend of the court of the government of Mexico under the figura), what is the procedure will be explained in the framework of the law on trade bankruptcies, and pointed out that it will adhere strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries had to meet the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.
In addition, it is pointed out that the country subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.

Héctor "Hetin," Reyes: "basketball was my life '
The globalization of the sport, Héctor "Hetin," Reyes, the basket was more than 60 years and has traveled around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of the history of the city of the country such as Héctor "Hetin," Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years, part of this sport, either as a player lower classes, the first National League player, agent and manager in the BSN with the vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My life I have put myself in the basketball many hats, even more at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," he remembered Reyes during a visit from Primera Hora Bayamón at home, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
Almost all the walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those who remember his time at the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated his fifteenth anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or director of the club.
"That was my best years that I have enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships of the vaqueros since 1967, as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN.
Then took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes says.
I do know that genes Bartow, who worked as a trainer here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was given to me, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had ever Puerto Rico.
Raymond Gausse Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists, and one of our best shooter.
I know, even as he said that, if Mincy allows for a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.
At that time he preferred it to enjoy its executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been, if not repeat this Canadian referee would have left us in the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the World Cup in 1990 was the best national team that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the US offered a fight against us, as when they won bronze at the World Cup.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be here in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, with which we won a gold medal and caused us great joy, was that of the upcoming tournament in 1995), Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of what happened at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We have had a number of good coach Julio Toro, Flor, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, the work of Leo Arill strikes me well.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995, which encompassed the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The fact that the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in your area, and only in the national teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children needlessly make many trips and games.
At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, contracts officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I would like to listen to music, see YouTube videos of music in my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and to go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry is dead
Larry was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was renowned for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the television series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, shrewd and manipulative businessman.
Larry, whose role as the Ölmagnat K.-J. Ewing in the television series "Dallas," has become a symbol of the greed of the 1980s is dead.
He was 81 years old.
, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer in accordance with a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown Dallas, where he was once again the iconic role that pleased him most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the harvest festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series, was when he died in the hospital of Dallas, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original and lived life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Cirrhosis was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years prior to "Dallas," was known in television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the NBC sitcom "Barbary Coast," the TV institution.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), which will be living with him at home.
He was also cast by two comedies that were broadcast only a short time, such as B.The Good Life "(NBC, 1971-72) and" Here we go again "(ABC, 1973).
His cinema works by the criticism well-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors" belonged.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable K.-J., which made for a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "who shot at J.R.?" The expectation should be created for an episode of emotion, where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
So the series reached a record in that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" in the second most entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had turned 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) had shot.
She had J.R. and threatened to make them as prostitutes, if you have not left the city, but also had other reasons for wanting to see him dead.
To leave the role of Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and untreuer husband, who sought a sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) later, its alcohol.
"I know what should be on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should read "here is the honorary citizens rests J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business, which he has not won.
The original series, Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin remembered Friday as a "tremendous personality and outside of the screen."
It is an unforgettable experience for millions of fans in the world and irreplaceable and leaves us, who had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago, with great success in the television channel TNT.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was shot, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT, such as the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a young people, when they got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater in New York at the beginning of the 1950's, and then he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air forces in England.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and she married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the city of Malibu, California, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he dubbed his memoirs "Hello: tall (and absolutely true) Tales About My Life."
"I have nothing written, of which I believed that it could harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
According to the liver transplant he championed liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital, anxious patients.
"I advise you to give them courage, I would like to meet with you, if their operations are approaching and then," he said in 1996.
I would like to give you a little consolation, such as "no fear, it is a bit inconvenient for them the first time, but it will go well."
He also set up against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
At the start of the course, who studies the "end of the World."
Every week, the students study apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Mayan calendar "long Rückwärtszählung" on 21 December, from which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But charmé had no idea what should expect him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the charmé apokalyptischste semester that there was ever," said this week the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone is analysed, what happened today in the world, as if we were thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only one professor, which offers courses this semester, which should actually be the last in the history of the "end of the world."
In Temple of beisitzende Professor Barry gives the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students studying apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread with the time," he said, as well as the manner in which hypothetical scenarios offered, which will lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic terms content and investigated, as they did in comparison with the real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," he said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history and his colleague, Matthew beisitzende Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology formed a team to provide a course with the simple words, "the end of the world."
"We do not in 2012, so that we always reserve the option to be able to hold the course for the case that all the rest of the world is not," he said.
In spite of the "impending doom," the students have to create projects and participate in exams.
Penn State in the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance, as "until the night to continue to work, where the world is supposed to end," said all the rest.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more seats in two hours' rest on its course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students said.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students, who asked whether courts are free.
For its part, the students assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing in order to console themselves," Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield said, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religion mentality is really only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25-year-old student wants Wekesa for psychology and nursing, said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be taught," he offered.
I enjoy it.
But none of those surveyed students - and much less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayans, and on certain manner we discredit them," Julie Zeglen, a student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester said.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in the Western society, which leads back several centuries, as people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased speculation.
"Elsewhere, the people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year responding quickly to the question of whether he would know where a course on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint on an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
The rest all pointed out that many days over the years has been talking about the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people think about philosophierten immediately to a new date," or the beginning of a seven-year period that the 21st of December was that the end of the world.
Students and professors to take this data easily.
Several said that they would like to go on "to celebrate the end of the world."
"Maybe I call on a few friends, so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
