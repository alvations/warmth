No liberating novella for Julia through Parliament 
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request , within the framework of a revision of the Penal Code paragraph , who had been sentenced on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko . 
The new rules , the way for the release of the detained Expremierministerin could pave , rejected the Members in the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes . 
Bakai was in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly adverse Treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas has been sentenced to seven years in prison . 
The judgment is not yet final , in December is the appeal of the convicted before the courts . 
Timoshenko call itself the judgment as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the1990 process raises the suspicion of the bias of the Court . 
The request , Article 365 , was sentenced on the basis of the Expremierministerin , from the criminal code , was supported by 147 members . 
226 votes would be needed to its adoption . 
Libyan victory 
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows their losers . 
Muammar el-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him is over the war . 
Now , there are just to define the winners . 
As usual him of that region , Islamists win in the elections , the only question is , what - the moderate or the radical . 
The National Transitional Council , the common law of the Scharīʿa , of which we are now in God has some idea . 
Libya would the country without crime , because for theft peck in short hand . 
Women should forget idea of emancipation as soon as possible , any congregants; breakaway are executed , and so on . 
Instead of a single dictator will society from mutually feuding tribes from the Koran . 
In short , in Libya will be an order apply; here would be hard to imagine and above all , not desirable . 
Only now is not the only - our lifestyle and objectively , will probably not be the best fit and would change the already-mentioned Libyans hardly . 
Accordingly , it is astonishing that the Moslem-Kämpfer rather of the infidel dogs clueless.Despite help at all . 
Was promoted to serve their defence , may only be the fact that the air strikes ΝΑΤΟ not by any General from America , but of Allah even led , whose omnipotence after every successful examples . 
The winners in Libya ? The West is not one of them . 
We were only in a shooting incident , served the interests of Islam and our politicians sought in the person of the dictator of political allies , without any advantage . 
Of the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq , we prefer a military occupation of Libya . 
This is the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders . 
The oil companies but also without occupation , the black gold on the song ? 
Hardly and can boast the West once with his selflessness in the protection of human rights . 
If they did not spoil the Scharīʿa-Vertreter .

The menu of a fat child addicts: humorous and not to eat dinner sausage 
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity , with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight . 
The current polls - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle . 
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment , in which he carpetshell and are the examples that surrounded him . 
On the tables adipöser children are sausages to half more on the table , as in families where normal; strong children . 
More than 19 percent of overweight children , on the eve of the Enlightenment action under the slogan ' obesity is no coincidence " chips for supper . 
In families with thick , is not a sport at the favorite jobs , but also the majority of today 's pupils - was only 15 that find their parents at least once a week time for active movement . 
Survey of 900 children 
The survey was last year at the end of this academic year , almost 900 children in primary schools across the Czech Republic . 
That was already the second batch of Action ' obesity is no coincidence ' , which is supported by the general insurance company and the society Unilever . 
To date , more than 12 thousand students in the project from 4 th and 8 th classes . 
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family , which are key factors for the increasing number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible . 
' only half of the children , for example , five times a day , in the modus Frühstück-zweites Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot main to eat - one of the conditions for a healthy diet , " this is one of the Exchange-Hong . 
No breakfast and sausages for dinner 
Experts point out that also relative things , such as the regular breakfast time of family , are important for the healthy development of a child . 
In the Czech Republic breakfast but only 23 per cent of the families of the students . 
And - in most families bishop alone . 
The worst was the assertion that in every tenth family is not any at all . 
Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily diet . 
The Umfragetest , among other things , on the day that they consumed in the families of overweight children much more often unhealthy chips . 
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink every day sweet drinks (70) 
Although more than 40 per cent of children sport , but only less than half of their parents do this - just 15 percent . 
Just give you your own menu together 
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from opportunities offered to put together their own menu appetito and opinion . 
" What Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of diet bias; , is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet . 
Among their favorite foods were many meal food , meat , and , of course , fresh food . 
" What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet drinks , " stresses in the final report on the survey . 
At lunch , so the main course , pasta , just before poultry . 
Pulses of almost all the children and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts; than lunch was very low . 
Hinkehr on health 
At the same time , the survey showed , however , that the children are quite prepared to change their eating habits , if they get the right information . 
" At the controls of the survey , the questionnaire after the conclusion of the present speech ' obesity is no coincidence " out , was in many cases a significant shift in the preferences to principles of healthy diet , " is in the results of the project . 
This was evident in the case of the sweet Limos , where many children began to give ordinary water . 
The children point in the questionnaire also much more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or over-sweetened food to eat . 
Experts; claim - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist 
In the initial article , learn how Stylisten , I always had a little bit that this was a bit too much fuel for the beginning . 
I was not in the slightest , which still is . 
Lectures of three professionals in the industry , the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the " in the square " . 
It is even worse to come . 
The closer we get to the test is , the more information and practical challenges; us before . 
But even when there is of course any on Saturdays and Sundays , he is nevertheless fully . 
This time , we debated with Director Alena (on course is not a single man), as a woman , which has no ideal proportionierte figure . 
And most of us . 
Have a short neck and the other to a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig . 
It is a matter for the Stylisten , broad shoulders look to conceal , conjuring up the neck or the necessary graphs . 
We got tips on how to Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - therefore , with great bosom , a hip and narrow their - nicely and attracts figurbetont , without fulfill--even too provocative . 
If , for example , the difference between their and hips is so great that the rock or the trousers really does not suit , it should at least a piece of clothed; groups . 
This will certainly be not regret , because good clothes is simply unaffordable . 
In such a tailor-made Rock you feel are much better than in a , the high and verrutscht , in the course of their absteht , etc . 
Jungenhafte figures can afford , in turn , clothing with wrinkles , construction , applications , lace or to take Raffung . 
For this amount of information and Figurtypen I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me go through the Oxfam-International everything thoroughly . 
And yet , I fear , not to create it is given the task assigned House almost . 
All the participants were given a Promi , for which they should devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe . 
We are the current appearance , the Modestil of the corresponding stars and its Figurtyp on board . 
To Miranda Kerr " , " that you may be from the campaign ' know Victoria 's Secret . 
Within juble I , because it is much better for me personally , as , for example , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , the last time on the hundred kilos has increased (oh well , this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez . 
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet , state and then deal with graphically . 
In the ' Moodboard ' , as the whole result is known , is our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design . 
It is very important to consider the graphic side of the Stylings too . 
The Stylist attracts the model not only physically , but is also known as the product side in the journalist (after concrete , for example , Trend-Handtaschen coats , etc .). 
Full-status told us of the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník . 
But the only on Sunday . 
That means that must have a Stylist a good overview . 
The figures with information on type-approval angefüllte Saturday speech was peppered from three visitors from the industry: 
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný , from fashion designers Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben . . 
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this . 
And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way . 
The magic word means variability . 
So you can take , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans , a T-shirt or coat , you can have it but also on the naked body , subparagraph shoes to attract and take it as a dress . 
Enough is enough , or roll up our sleeves and get to see from the whole look very different . 
 " Others-plays , " he said . 
Most came to me but the following Council: " First of all , you have to know the rules perfect . " 
" Only then you must violate them , " said Jakub . 
It is clear to me why we need to pauken all these theories , which can be combined with what and why , even if you get to see in Modejournalen often quite different . 
Not to mention fashionable look . 
Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now , that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options , as photographed it . 
So we need for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared , at least fifteen to stylen . 
And also that the clothing on the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality . 
With all of this , so in the design of the attire . 
That image and Styl sometimes make up half of the success , which confirmed a Jan Pokorný as well . 
Because one needs only to Madonna , not just a brilliant singer , have made the image and marketing a world star . 
In the Czech Republic is the services of a Stylisten rather reserved . 
Also doet people often think that this is a wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something , how I turned out is secondary). 
And if any of us stylen , then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs . 
It needs to be googlen then only to determine with certainty that writes the tabloid press , the Promi have declined to or , etc . 
On Sunday , Jan and Mario Inter-ministerial us not to believe , that we are in Stylist just to focus on the fashion and then the clothes " assemble them " needs . 
In his work must communicate it , especially with the people who he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist . 
People think , without curry favor and stick to its opinion . 
" If any of us , a director in order to see their clothes cabinet and to complement fine , we can clear up and say we have the whole cabinet - my God , this is terrible . " 
" You have to find at least a few worthy things , to which it recommends , what they can contribute , " says Mario . 
He showed us in real terms , as a so-called " place pocket; " must include . 
So a pocket; , the pre-Maastricht in the waists zuknöpft and in the pre-Maastricht all the necessary Proprietäten in . 
No such clear , as gap , Abroller to remove hair or security needles , they also Utensilien , such as a Nylonfaden (it helps the Stylist the photographing of products , such as handbags or avoid), specific clips , which will be tightened up , the clothes , if it is too big Stecknadeln (or other Klemmen are banned , so that is not the substance of) and , of course , Nähzeug . 
So we must listen to but not only , but also to try something , we learned , as in we put shoes . 
Is also in the photography at the courses , where the floor is , it is the Schuhsohle damage , let alone the outside . 
We klebten o and klebten we ... 
With the gap must be the shoes again , so that they are not damaged . 
So we must be really well . 
Mario was me , by my " creation " praised without restrictions . 
The skill is not just mentioned my strength . 
All this was only a fraction of what we did in the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs . 
One thing is clear to me now - to address the styling at a professional level is not an easy task . 
V Need for steroids: " The turgidity " - the illegal race across America 
Recession; 
The original reckless journey is through a series of entirely preventable , dilettantish mistakes; routine in the morning . 
It was , the ambitions; in large part to play , but what is the point , if there is clearly no one wish , a bit more to do . 
Even before he came to the Ladentische , the new part of Brejão with subtitle , " The turgidity " high expectations . 
He promised , but the old games series " Need for steroids " to postpone a step into a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play seemed to be not only one of many Action-Rennspielen . 
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist from the car , and continue on foot . 
But how NFS is , is actually a case , so accustomed than was expected . 
Sure - there are potentially very decent Arkade-Rennen , but on the whole , the game from a number of unnecessary errors , which are present in this series are already more or less a few years . 
So there are no more mistakes , but signs of incomprehensible laziness in principle the games developers . 
The adventure begins very well . 
First introduced it in history , has its main character Jack certain problems personal nature , the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America . 
In San Francisco , on the west coast , set to the wheel , with the task to be first in New York . 
The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements . 
The whole route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty individual race . 
This means that every race on other route and that the various stages in different , different and interesting enough milieu . 
One gets the impression that game would not take a moment to offer the same thing over and over again . 
Some of these environments are still very nicely , though , not the technical level the graphics on the earlier part of the series . 
So nothing called; . 
But the journey through the desert , herbstliche landscape or high above--relatively visually inspected by verschneite landscape we very pleasant . 
Now and then atypical elements a little change in the individual race . 
In the desert , for example , is surprised by a desert storm , which reduces the point of view . 
In the mountains , in turn , must you need to watch that you will not by an avalanche of being buried . 
By the way are quite good running the individual race . 
Only a few , but they are . 
For a while they tried to overtake so , the number of compulsory opponents (in principle) a classic race , then there will be time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expected an even a personal duel with a single opponent . 
And that also involves himself the police , the whole thing will blow . 
A novelty are passages in which Jack out of the car . 
It is more about certain interactive , in which Jack before anyone is and where he has to help the players in the right moment , the right button . 
So nothing complicated . 
It is surprising , however , that there is in the game much less such passages , as one would expect (actually only three). 
After all , this is to the advantage of rather , because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above--relatively point one of the elements that make the game diversify . 
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts . 
This means that from today 's point of view , it is no trees , on the other hand , you could not say that it would be bad . 
Who realistic simulations , must look elsewhere . 
But a action; invited Rennfahren meets the European Fahrmodell continue , although could be found in the competition better . 
Until then , as far as everything is well . 
Real problems , only after a certain time . 
In contrast to the Fahrmodell is not the conflict-of-law model quite OK 
Of a game of this kind is difficult to expect that it complicated deformations and collisions , but if it has virtually no impact on any object idea , what the car is doing , then obviously not everything is in order . 
Typical example: the close do or over--and drive to oncoming cars " does " in some of the other car only slightly , in others , almost identical situation is but skidding and is wild performance . 
Or the Karre to scrap . 
Thanks to the Restart-Systems makes it no more , it is annoying . 
The rest are resolved as Arts: if you total damage has or is far outside the line , then a the game on the last point . 
Only - in every race has only five rest Arts . 
If they have exhausted , all from scratch . 
The rest are Arts , rather as a tool in the event that is not something that should leave but not on it . 
Helps sometimes but not even the Restart , and nothing else , as the critical section to learn from the head . 
Extremely unpleasant , is that the same things happen often in the same places . 
Some curves must pass through , for example in a specific way , otherwise it is not easy . 
Elsewhere it in his list " civilian " cars are in the same configuration , whether it be the first and fifth , five seconds sooner or a minute later . 
It is annoying to see that , particularly in situations of Kontrahent before a romped two oncoming cars are ignored , but until it gets to the cars already in such a position that they must stop or to avoid it . 
And there is no difference when we arrive , everything is designed so that there is this situation--help close to your nose . 
The opponents have other benefits . 
Throughout the game , there are a few places where you always in the same place the same opponents obsolete , and will be again regardless of the time . 
The crazy TENs this is at the end of the game on the long bridge , which is in the right direction . 
The Kontrahent must here seem to overtake come hell or high water . 
And then , when it is facing a , then of course it makes a point of view , so we will initially other-gender car a couple of times in Klump . 
Clear - trying to make the game simply more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clearly , fulfill--even anticipate--a quickly , the joy of account; spoiled . 
And this is a pity , because despite sold Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and in some places so aktionsgeladen , that almost no longer know , where one of the head . 
And in principle , no matter what it is - " over-reward " the concept with  unique routes , the organisation of the race in a way that can prevent boredom , or something quite different ... 
An unusual idea is the least in the course of the race . 
We must not overlook the petrol stations on the road , because here you can switch the car , although there is in most cases the car , which has one . 
The cars are divided into three categories . 
The sports cars are well suited to the urban areas , the strong American brand for the precise motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys; , for example , on the Serpentinen in the mountains . 
Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the Aufgaben-Modus (challenges) - the race in the individual premises , we know from history . 
Here there are not only medals , but also to gain experience for their own profile that together for the tasks (challenges) and history . 
In order to get to the higher level , drivers must be open to different objects: from the car , to the Backgrounds for the profile . 
This is linked to the online role Autolog , among others , the own achieved results with those of other players and also for further collective functions . 
One of Schnitzern further incomprehensible is a situation in the last race of the history . 
Here it is: the car in a passengers; (as), where it is in the dark on the track for desecrate (as). 
On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km / h (I), but there is suddenly from behind a metro and is a tough to scrap . 
In our editorial , as well for a long time about whether a blackout in the game makers was or whether to keep the authors is so stupid . 
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there . 
Even more galling is that some of Bildwiederholfrequenz exciting times and this sometimes quite dramatic . 
This is particularly the case for accidents with greater number of concerned , where a continuous FPS nothing good . 
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound track is taste . 
In an effort to address a as broad as possible range rather young audience , created a Soundtrack a lá ' by each buy something " - but who is such a game because of the music ? ! 
The overall picture on Need for steroids: The turgidity ? The feelings are more mixed . 
If the game not by the already-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes , we would have with the held belief that The turgidity is the best piece of NFS in recent years . 
But so is the game somehow unfinished . 
To be a pleasure , but we should be prepared that this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes .

Ambassador Vicenová: 
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics 
" The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions feelable upset . " 
I did not expect that such a hard war flares . " 
" It will take five , six years , until the dust settled , and all will have become accustomed to her new role , " began girl Milena Vicenová , the Czech ambassador to the European Union , rather launch-on-warning lecture at the law faculty . 
How seriously it takes the motto ' Verständlich and openly about Europe ' , they showed in the first part of their lecture , in which it was , the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they so many editor would have the law faculty of the Karlsuniversität can . 
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy: 
" There has been criticism that he had to quietly - a grey official who is not up to such a role , but I must say that it has " all the time , how well he has taken up the cause . 
" He is a person who it is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patient; to communicate with them and the particularly clear ideas on how to proceed with the EU . 
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question: Who is the is supposed to - the European Union ? What number I call ? " , so as an important step towards the integration and better visibility of the EU 's policy towards states , such as China or India . 
Nobody wants us our Ölmützer Quargel ban 
Mrs Vicenová , also of the agenda , in accordance with the European Union , and lived in the near future to live . 
The Czech presidency of two years ago , describing it as a success . 
The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership . 
The fall of the government during the Presidencies described it as a great negative , which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic . 
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full . 
Said with the words of the ambassador , was not only the Presidency , but also in the subsequent crisis , which is not yet to quite hectic . 
And there must be approved by the Sieben-Jahres-Budget of the EU , which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated . 
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget , which received industries , which countries more and receive less support - all of this is now on the agenda . 
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels , " Verständlich on Europe . " 
" If I do not like something , then it is gräuliche SWIFTs , vocabulary; and jargon that nobody understands . 
How can I as citizens; really know whether it is in Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and different great bananas invented or whether anyone actually want to ban the Quargel . 
They used the soil of the EU would also like to , in order to get more Czechs in European institutions . 
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect 
The EU believes that the Czechs have a reputation for , to be Eurosceptics , the more the negative , as the positive sides of the issue . 
All the more worrying is the low representation of Czechs in European institutions . 
There are many factors , including the moderation; our candidate , whose inability to write letters and motivation not least the weak support of the Czech side . 
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency it lifted the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group , of the V4 . 
" Believe me , if a Pole or Hungarian come to me and is a Slovak , in the vicinity , then the Frenchman next to me: " Hey , what is it is because the heads together - is once again your V4 ? " And it makes a quite acid Face . 
Mrs Vicenové , expect the EU especially tough rules in the future of far-from-equilibrium budgetary policies more of the member states . 
As much of that as a " European Federation " is the concept of a Europe of the two , or even different speeds . 
" We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone . 
" We already have the Schengen area and we have the Institute of Harbor cooperation . " 
" For the first time , it was said that should work only the countries that want it and those who do not want it to be quiet outside . " 
" There will be more and more of these institutions , which ultimately on a strong " multi-speed Europe ' , " Mrs Vicenová expected . 
In this respect , paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle , according to the need to be considered not all issues with impact on the whole of the EU by all the member states and only by the countries of the euro zone . 
Fire story: 
The innovator IBM enters its existence the second century 
Wanted to look for a suitable word that characterised the strategy of IBM most closely , that would be the word ' longevity . " 
IBM is a synonym for technological revolution to the general public , it is known as a modern companies , although since its inception a century has passed . 
The basis of this longevity , already presented its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.W. 
Already he argued the slogan , countless were easily solve global problems , if the people were prepared to think a little bit . 
His slogan " think ! " Has been so for the trademark , for the life of the future giants should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine , which , in IBM in 1935). 
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture . 
" For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future . 
IBM survived and was also an entire century , because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else surrounding it . 
The allowed us , in the course of our first century , the technologies to transform the business and society . 
We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years , " said Samuel J. Palmisano , who is now director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary . 
Thought-out system 
Watson was already in the thirties socio-medical its employees - in a similar way , such as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers paid leave , insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a reasonable pay system for best innovators and traders . 
As more sophisticated are also of IBM long-term relationships with their customers . 
The company was from the outset in the brilliant talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world , on IBM any discrimination - and could decide accordingly . 
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan , will barely-existent the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty . 
Is already the thirty years with IBM , so far , the position of the Vetriebs- , marketing and strategy leader; . 
IBM makes so-called Online-Brainstormings in recent years , from where many future strategies and innovation . 
No wonder - ideas there are enough , the company is almost half a million people . 
An institution with a good reputation 
Their unwavering position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and this after within and outside . 
" From the outset , IBM , the concept of an institution , as a mere technology-producing company , " said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter . 
" IBM is not a technology-producing companies , but a company , the business helps solve problems using technology , " added George Colony of Consulting-Firma Forrester Research . 
As the companies themselves , there is a difference , to be on the market only present or to shape it through this presence directly . 
Family called " Big Blue " for their logos IBM - in the States , is one of the largest companies in the world has come in a century . 
It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and consulting services in a broad product - of servers to nanotechnology . 
Of all the American technology companies has IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize . 
To its most famous inventions include , for example , bank machines , credit cards , Finanzswap , bar code or the diskette . 
With approximately $ 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM in this year 's second largest technology-producing companies (after Apple), and it took for the first time since 1996 , Microsoft . 
Looking ahead 
Not all products and innovations , the taste of the customers of today - were unhappy OS for example the attempt with its own operating system / 2 , the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr . 
' business is based on the forward movement , not tie it emotionell in the past , " said to Samuel J. Palmisano . 
Therefore has no problem IBM , its foundations to build on various platforms - and if they do not work , they have to leave . 
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft , with its Windows operating system stands and falls . 
Promising technologies 
To the factor- of IBM participate in great extent services , software and hardware to participate in a fifth . 
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share . 
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit safest assets with a value of $ 15 billion , in the same time , however , $ 58 billion in the future technologies . 
In these investment continues IBM after 2008 , and saw the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world . 
Here , too , IBM was faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson , in the midst of the Great Depression its scale . 
So far , it seems that survives the company IBM today 's crisis unscathed . 
The value of the IBM-Aktien rose by 120 percent since 2008 raketenartig and the profit of the company productivity--the kontinuell . 
Is the corporate slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values . 
Also is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis resolves . 
Ibm-geschichte: from cheese Schneider to space flights 
The one hundred years in New York started-up society International Business Machines (IBM) had initially quite a sophisticated - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation . 
The name IBM took it in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America . 
The foundations for subsequent society IBM , the merger of four companies , whose history until the 80 s of the 19 th century . 
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren for the registration of the work and start -endes . 
Was the architect of this new company Charles Ranlett Flint , which had also holds the Presidency on the board until 1930 . 
And it was Flint , which stopped the head of the competition , Thomas J. Watson , so that he did this in the management of the company . 
The Leader , the founder of IBM in the shadow - ' is based on Watson 's ideas until today the invincible culture and identity of the company . 
Watson , the company until 1952 . 
IBM , reveals , as the name suggests , with the production and distribution of all sorts of machinery for the trade - of sausages and Käseschneidern , to cash . 
Watson in the first four decades in which he led the company , doubling its profits to $  million and the company rapidly after and after all continents . 
Watson was essential for the company so that he economybased sat in the job for  years , only then , he was replaced by his son , Thomas Watson younger . 
Leading IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache . 
In the 60 s helped engineers and computer of IBM NASA flights into space - the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 , the famous flight of people to the moon . 
Meanwhile , IBM in 1964 the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM system / 360 . 
A classic PC , certain of the computer standard that time , in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market . 
Twenty years later veräußerte IBM computer its production to the Chinese society Lenovo , on the other hand , they consulted , however , the part of the company and PricewaterhouseCoopers , now fully in the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value . 
The strategy , the IBM in the last three years pays; is the concept of " Smarter Planet . " 
It embodies the intention to use technologies to wise way in has not even planned areas , for example , to improve the situation in transport and in the Städteverwaltung . 
In the commercial sector , IBM introduced recently the ' Smarter Commerce ' platform , the dealers should help to manage the whole commercial cycle . 
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic . 
In 1932 founded IBM a branch at all in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe . 
Today , IBM ČR , among other things , a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno . 
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and here is a Top-Forscherteam world-class that deals with the technology of the Stimmerkennung .

After their spouses Josef Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become whose lover , Darina still hope that Josef from his touches dream and come home . 
But it is now with the patience over--and definitively and for the rest of life , it has clear rules .

As cesur Iveta at their insistence , after 30 days , and get back to íany , with Josef . 
Yes he doet even publicly , that he was fond of it . 
Resigned Darina with time , and indeed it seemed as if they are with their untreuen man system; cost - but they were now finally ditch him . 
Rychytář , it doesn 't matter , sleeping with whom his wife 
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová in future but should leave , then he will hypocrites; certainly not open arms . 
" He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to adopt his days in our common home , then I will not Out " him . 
" But not as beloved verirrter old ass , but as a person , to whom I have still some ties , " Hwang Mrs Rychtářová; they also said , however , they have separated from him already emotionell and alone decency . 
The fact that he has Darina the back door locked , Josef so far , with dignity . 
" The decision my wife I respect . "

" With Darina have I quite normal , only the bed we do not share it , " said J. Rychtá (the story) Blesk . 
If Darina wants to seek a new love , then he wants to not stop it .

It is clear to me that this is my fault , I was in love with me Iveta and therefore I take any responsibility . 
The worst female vices: what 's with you ? 
If you call the men , some typical female fights to shake , then they are all some promptly from the sleeves . 
The women , see you in the following lines , in which a few Unsitten review , which the men of the wallen ? 
Shopping addiction 
Accuses them her husband to be shopping addicted ? 
You have to buy at least one more week ? 
You like to go shopping and must be in actions; also a bit more ? 
Then it really in your case is a weakness . 
Some women are the least aware and try to keep their shopping a reasonably under control . 
But the truth is , what is it to bummeln not in search of a good sitting upper clothing only by a clothing business and equality; all (in all kinds of Farbkombinationen) try in the cab ? 
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women , for the men it is often the pure hell . 
Think about it but , as often to her husband has already said - stick you would rather be outside ... 
Permanent discontent 
" I am not too fat ? " 
" I have to at least five kilos - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik to make ? " 
" I liked you at all ? " 
Is familiar to them somehow ? 
Yes ? 
Then you will belong to the women , the obsession of this are , how they look . 
That does not mean that you go in , but many men respond allergic to when a wife are constantly on their appearance whinges . 
The greater gender is agree; - with rising frequencies; of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher . 
Order and cleanliness in first place 
It is a fight against windmills . 
Page-window clean sweep , places and dust , scheuern the bath - and this at least twice a week . 
, with its partners , because he continues , with shoes on the clean places , chastise you the children , because it gescheuerte Waschbecken once again is bad and because the glass door in the living room cabinet once again fingerprints , which makes it the whitening so much trouble ? 
You should suffer from this kind of ' Devianz ' , then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life cannot come first . 
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately mutual relations and above all quiet in the family . 
Antagonising 
" Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket . " 
" Do you want to run the old socks really attract again tomorrow ? " 
" A watery towel , not just on the floor . " 
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade , you should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme . 
Clearly this is not bad , they want to , but only the everything right . 
If the men knew this , then the women may not need so much to grumble . 
Gossip and novelty 
Some women and clap , Chen , as will getuschelt behind the backs or slander or be forging alliances . 
Women are now focused on relations , that is why they are to such issues by , for example - who , where , with whom , how and why . 
I think any of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and novelty to camps . 
Hand on heart , that is all women . 
This is not to confuse but with gossip aunts most calibre , which is nothing and nobody , the all around them , and are especially for women collective a considerable risk . 
Jágr and Voráek by Philadelphia with their Assistenzen to victory 
The Eishockeystürmer Mr Jágr had the Monday game of the NHL with two Assistenzen large share of the 5:3 victory in Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and this is again produktivster Czech players in the NHL . 
Beneficiaries of the overview of the neununddreißigjährigen Eishockeystars was in both cases , the Giroux Claude a assistance and was declared the best players of the matches . 
Two Assistenzen , recorded in the same game Jágr 's model--defines fellow-player Jakub Voráček . 
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had predicted Giroux a great evening . 
" Before the game I said to him that he is today a trifecta . " 
The feeling I had somehow . " 
Quot; now and then feel a such a feeling , " said Jágr , after the action Giroux already the first shot of the Flyers the first goal . 
A bit later had the second hits ' a Czech track . " 
Voráek won behind the door of the Hurricanes the Puck and presented him between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot . 
One second to reached the final of the first third of the Heimspieler Patrick Dwyer a Short-Hander , but the second third again the Flyers . 
Specifically Giroux . 
In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hits , then Wayne Simmonds whose shot for the fourth goal . 
" I love to play with him . " 
" I am not saying that he is the best players in the league , but certainly it is one of the best three ' , paid tribute Jágr his Center . 
" It would be in life not occur to me that I would like to end my career with such a player is , as with him . " 
" I am pleased about this huge . " 
" I am raising my game on I too . " 
" All the years in the NHL my fellow-player questioned their game on me a and now turns the tables , " schmunzelte Jágr . 
Carolina game even more to the tragedy - by the right of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer , who is from a Strafschuss victory , it was on a goal . 
Little Read , but any further complication , in which he was successful in majority two against one . 
" Excellent , Pronger in our zone . " 
" He got off the Puck , I took on and (Read), to more distant framework . " 
" I tried to take it and I am glad that it has worked , " Voráek described the last hit of the game from his point of view . 
By this victory , Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference . 
The Czech defensive players Montreal Jaroslav paek injured in the game against Buffalo and left in the second half because of a violation in the upper body . 
The Candiens losing about their learnt Beck also a unverloren their leadership in Penalty-Schießen 2:3 . 
One of the Strafschüsse could not Tomáš Plekanec . 
More than the lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team , the high disease; absenteeism in the defensive; - the game they played only with five defensive players . 
" This is bad . " 
" The meeting; we played only to end with a single experienced players , the rest were young players . " 
" But it can be to do nothing , so we must be ready , " Jacques Martin said . 
" For every change a wave after wave and we had nothing . " 
" We had the game easier and need to bring the Puck from our third . " 
There was room for improvement , " said P. K. Subban , one of the defensive players . 
The Czech gate-keepers; Ondřej Pavelec , thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg . 
At the gates of the jets , which ended a series of five defeats , had five different shooter had share . 
Development of the travel prices since 1989 
Until 1989 there was in the SSR only five approved state travel agents: edok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist . 
The travel agents sold at the time , especially only travel in the socialist bloc , in the West were the only chosen . 
And so , Czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union in the Crimea peninsula (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use it . 
Was a silver excep the period from 1962 to 1972 , when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia , then a pro-Western course a proposed Yugoslavia and have therefore been severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia . 
A great paradox of socialist times it was the fact that it may not even be citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel within the framework of the socialist countries . 
If I wanted to travel a citizen of the SSR for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union , then took it to a so-called invitation letter , were not Individualreisen possible . 
Even then , to the travel agents also travel to the West , then had to be huge queues in purchasing or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency , or at least " good friends " in the travel agency . 
Also so the matter was not yet . 
The so-called currency - the condition for an exit to the West - was only " politically reliable " of people - the other could not travel . 
The Czech currency was not free exchange as currency , foreign exchange , it would have been impossible , so the necessary funding (Western) find currency for a trip to the West . 
The way most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home , it is no wonder that bought the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas - a habit that continues to this day . 
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the revolution of the Czechs . 
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR in Bulgaria or the measure of all things , spent the Czechs last year 4,5 million their holidays abroad in countries around the world . 
A huge paradox , which is not at all now , is the fact that , in the most popular holiday country the Czechs - could not travel to Croatia 1989 at all , because it was part of the former Yugoslavia . 
From the beginning of the 90 s of the last century was lifted in the foreign exchange duty in the neighboring West European countries , which caused a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany . 
The Tschechoslowaken could not get over a long period of their trips to the West simply enough , everyone wanted to have at least a few days since . 
So slept the Czech holidaymakers in travel to Paris in the tent in the park , because who would have guessed the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension . 
A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a with canned , beer and sausages , etc . Vollgepackter boot . 
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades , our tourists buy the Western currency finally free . 
Our standard of living and , consequently , the average salaries rose to 1997 , which einmündete in another important moment . 
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights , which the air travel because of the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts , economy--with compared to the past . 
At the end of the 90 s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already exchange of payment with all advanced countries in the world , making it even easier travel . 
Another interesting moment in the history of the " post-utopian Velvet ' travel there was in 2000 , when it was Community-cleared thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand . 
Since then fly direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers every year in distant sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic  exotic destinations . 
Of the 100 Tsd . Czechs travel every year in exotic places ! 
Another important moment in the era , which our ' post-revolutionary ' development marked , came in 2008 . 
Roll on 17 November 2008 , the US visas for Czech tourists , which most definitely our country under the most developed countries of the world . 
More than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in years the Czechs spent 2008 (50,3%) and for the first time in its history peasants-a it for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt including the costs on the destination for more than 15 Tsd . CZK per capita . 
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again , there is a stalemate . 
Almost five months , the Czech football and there is no chairman that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known . 
Until today , there is still no agreement , after the electoral law . 
And this is no vote on the three potential successor . 
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík . 
In June Hašek resigned his role , and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to come together and to find a strong personality , which could lead the football in the future . 
Only in the era of Hašek , from the old squabbles between the two chambers Association , which are unable to agree on a joint candidate . 
This was very clearly on 16 September , should be chosen as the new chairman . 
The delegates of the main assembly; euro-egoism free of charge to Public House in Prague Smíchov quarter , because the negotiations led to a result and it was not only about the election itself . 
We could not agree is about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutes representatives or even with the full power of officials . 
In this single point it was at least partly agreement , which also helped the recommendation of the Institute for government and legal , whose opinion is not a representation at full power base . 
The divergencies in order the electoral law , however , continue to take . 
The Executive Committee did not bring more clarity in the matter , part-sessions , whether regular or extraordinary - is in principle nothing else on the agenda . 
Even if the opinions in a couple of times about the election changed - the worst point remained the same . 
The question is: how do we proceed in the 3 th round , in order to avoid a stalemate ? 
" The issue is the question whether or not to be in accordance with the constitution , or whether we need to find a different model , " said Duan Svoboda , one of the three deputy chairman of the ex-FAR , who represents in the management of the professional football . 
According to a registered model candidate who prevails in the third round of the greater as support in the chamber , for which he stood . 
Moravia is supposedly ready to compromise , that the one candidate prevails , which the higher number of votes from both chambers . 
The Czech side again , on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority . 
" We have the two Vorrunden make no sense , this method would put the entire two Chamber; concept in question , " Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side , it would be the best , not tweaking the electoral law , but to choose under current rules . 
Agrees with surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík , even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta . 
" It is my wish that , as far as possible after the statute is elected . " 
" It could be a nonsensical replacement options , such as at the last general meeting , " said the owner of the (football clubs) Victoria Plzeň , the candidates for the first time and abgrenzte in his opinions in particular Pelta . 
Pelta but remains optimistic . 
His opinion , in Nymburk the new chairman will be known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future . 
" The possible qualifications of the national team for the Championships today would certainly contribute to calm the emotions . " 
" If the football until the euphoric wave ride them , then it is also the willingness to cooperate , " the official says Jablonec larger , by all three Adepten the most experience and this is both at a professional , and regional level . 
Rajchl is restrained . 
" I hope for an agreement , but the situation is unfortunately is ambivalent . " 
" This is not a matter between the people in Bohemia and Moravia , but there are some efforts , the rules to own purposes " officialdom . " " 
" That is why a new on the general meeting not excluded . " 
" However , I hope that common sense prevails in the end , " said Rajchl . 
Only - there is not much time to the agreement of all sides left . 
Some negotiations should be supposedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows , maybe the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification will be completely at all . 
The charter plane , with the should fly , among other things Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl after Podgorice , was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical problem , and so was urgently for a replacement variant , how to be a part of the executive committee but to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels . 
In the end it is surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level , to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday . 
Josef Dobe , the minister for education , youth and physical education have divided the parties within the biggest sports ' of the country to an agreement . 
There is a lot at stake: government grants , the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the ČSTV , the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction . 
Paclík in the fight for the position of Chairman , because he sees no suitable candidates 
If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate to represent , all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met , he would have been not to the fight for the top position . 
" If there was a good candidate , then I would fight for it and give up on the election . " 
" But in the current situation , we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find , " said Paclík ČTK . 
The main reason for Paclík , into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go , it is to prevent the pseudo-developmental favorite of the election , Pelta , at the top of the FAČR . 
Paclík also stresses that he only if he wins the role of the chairman intends to exercise a year , until 2013 , until the date of the proper general meeting . 
In the position of the chairman would have liked it to be a " golden parachutes , " the Russia--at is not too much in the football . 
" With some in question people I have spoken personally . " 
" Hard to believe that I have some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football . 
 " Such views would have liked to have changed , " he quoted . 
Most of all is Paclík supposedly the link Pelta 's with the chairman of the Pilsner district Football Association Berbr novel , a man with kontroversem reputation , which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to influence delegated votes in general meetings . 
It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable , that Pelta holds the position of the chairman . 
" In his victory would become of einkonserviert and in the Czech football is not it at all . " 
" The support of Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , would get the football pollero twice , " said Paclík . 
It is he , too , that Pelta ' was 's name some time ago in connection with the investigation of corruption in a case , from the Pelta but go unpunished . 
" I do not know what Prestige; a victory of Pelta (tsch .) football should get involved . " 
" And where would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA , " said ekl Paclík , its former said , " it will sell the Pilsner football club , when will Pelta chairman ' , but something more . 
Should win Paclík in Thursday 's election , he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta . 
Just as another candidate thinks - Rajchl , had supported the Paclík before the general meeting in October , which ended with a fiasco . 
" He (Pelta) would be the first , to which I would go . " 
" He has great skills . " 
" I could imagine him well for example as head of the national team . " 
" But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager . " 
" It is not my nose but in matters , which I understand nothing , " said Paclík , who had been in September for attention that he was behind the recall of referee Commission with Luk Macela at the top , replacing the Dagmar Damková . 
Paclík claims , it is equal to the role of the group leader . 
And holding up his skills in the direction of private companies , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen , the celebrated with his support in May the first triumph in the League . 
" I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to the cultivation of this . " 
" In order to limit the influence of interest groups , tend to the disciplinary and influence of commissions , which in turn to II; situations , " led to Paclík , which makes no secret of its antipathy for example to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Ketínský . 
As one of its priorities would be the establishment of the relations between the ex-FAR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee , with which he would save in the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport . 
" This is one of the key things that should devote itself to the new chairman . " 
" When it comes to taxation of gambling , and declare the political parties , then I understand their reasoning , we have to say it but also very clearly where the money goes , " he said . 
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap , although he emphasised , the chairman of the ex-FAR " bipartisan " . 
, in turn , is associated with Jablonec pelta Rajchl with the Prague Dukla . 
" It is not ideal . " 
" It is not my opinion but also make much sense to transfer my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years , " said Paclík clear . 
Pelta promised new statutes of the ex-FAR , the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future . 
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association , one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt , Miroslav Pelta promised he would if elected , that the FAČR new statutes that disputes over the electoral law , rule out in future . 
The official from Jablonec believes is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and that the campaign would modest.They in any success of the Czech selection . 
Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September , he wants to focus on his election to the national team and the collection of funds . 
He decided only at the last moment , to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so was the two-month break help him to defend his ideas about the running of football and in a broader context . 
" People at all levels to address the football , they are impatient and therefore expect that know the chairman on Thursday . " 
" He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone , the man who believes in particular is linked with the Jablonecer club , but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee . 
Also , he has said that it had sufficient experience , in order to lead the Czech football . 
He is convinced that is for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria that was at the time of Ivan Hašek . 
" Unfortunately have been approved by the General Assembly in June statutes , which were not completely , as it had adopted all . 
If they had not allowed different interpretations , from September , " said Pelta had a chairman . 
Just the revision of the most important document of the residents ' association he used as a sweetener for the delegates . 
" Should I be chairman , then I take it personally and I am prepared to take personal responsibility , if it does not work . " 
" It is a matter of principle , without which he could not be , " said Pelta . 
In addition , he is not trying to differentiate themselves from his opponent . 
He had announced earlier , it could be a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , recognizes the for its legal education , and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy . 
Also Tomáš Paclík , he has been for a long time , which , in turn , no dry thread Pelta the1990 . 
In football it can more than a year ago and is already moving with some success . " 
" But its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were very shocked by his election campaign . " 
" Also addressed now many doubt his true nature , " Pelta remain faithful to his opponent , probably the Caribbean-basin repeating proclamations , which he said in September . 
His opinion , its biggest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions , to the national team . 
And this should be the flagship Czech football . 
" I would try to end all Affairen - from the issue Bohemians , to the halls of the corruption scandal last year . " 
" Then , would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football , " said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate TK two months ago . 
At that time , he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football no human cleansing; would mean . 
" I had to make myself with the content of all employees familiar , " he said in Strahov , where there is because of the long anarchy; understandably nervous . 
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which accompany the forthcoming general meeting , he believes that the delegates on Thursday will not go to Nymburk in vain . 
" If there really should be the only point of contention , as you choose in the third round , then we will be over . " 
" The football needs credibility and win back only when he finally has a new Leader ' , Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day its official career optimistic . 
Rajchl promises that to work the ex-FAR below him hard begins 
If should be elected the ViceChairman Jindich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic , would supposedly feeding frenzy that many people in the group the whim . 
Rajchl promises that , if elected , to work hard . 
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual Fußballbereiche . 
Also promised to resolve the case Bohemians , relations with the UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and will continue the work that has begun the previous presiding Ivan Hašek . 
" As chairman , I would like to dwell on the football as a whole . " 
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the national selection , the professional football , to the performance of football for the youth . " 
" This is not to say that I want to do everything alone , " said Rajchl in talks for ČTK . 
" I am a team player and would like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that is devoted to each member a certain area . " 
And I will distribute hard tasks , so that the football in every segment with twelve-mile steps . " 
Mafias; many would not just delighted , because they , rather than the work of other to criticise , now even to work really hard , " he added . 
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered not to stand at all . 
" I know that I am working 20 hours a day . " 
" But I must know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me , not me constantly stick; between the legs and every step that I make , calling into question , " he said as an explanation as to why he has hesitated . 
" However , many people have told me that I should not give up , because it would otherwise also others do . " 
" It is confidence , we must not squander it , " he said . 
Supposedly motivated him to be able to continue the work , which he has begun between Hašek . 
I now " in two years , we have dealt with a great deal of work and this is not simply throw . " 
" It has been launched processes , the only in a few years to come and I would hate to see that it is painful , " he said , and that his concerns that , in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Mr Pelta , could return to the situation in the days before Hašek . 
" I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not brings . " 
' behind him , especially people who would make the football so that it would be only for chosen as ' . 
I think I can , but not a lot that I would be biased . " 
" I try to be objective . " 
" I want football for all , because it all goes well and not only of the candidates , " said Rajchl . 
It also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs . 
" Even if some people say the opposite , I really don 't have to do what is best for Moravia . " 
" For example , it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part , whose winners in each of the first League felt . " 
" Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , " Rajchl says . 
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman , dares Rajchl not to estimate the chances that he will be elected . 
" I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber , which has been elected to her deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me , " led to Rajchl , which includes the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfortunate contracts , the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success . 
On the other hand , it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association is not a single thing . 
While he Pelta says , ' he was disqualified from the outset , to bring greater confidence to the Czech football ' , he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate , of the football really have something to offer . 
" No one can call into question , that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year . " 
" He should be elected , then he would continue the things that has taken Hašek Ivan and also the personnel in the commissions would not change it , obviously . " 
It would make things certainly not altered just want , " ruling in its favour Rajchl on his rivals . 
Europe 's most beautiful pools 
Leap in the dark 
Julie Stanek 
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik , Prunkpools in Budapest , who travels through Europe , can be blue miracle - and , after a town-twinning Tour or undermine the tired feet in Sprudelbädern . 
A book shows , where called in the water is the most beautiful . 
If Meder Iris , in the last one and a half years on research , could not have one in their luggage: her bathing suit . 
Rücklings on the water , it was high in art was fully domes , they swam to Marmor-Putten , the basin , they were , and , on Jugendstilschwimmhallen meticulously restored . 
It was a bad , they have in their note book - and know values; details about the design and history of the building . 
More than 200 pools fact-finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now , in their book " bathing , ": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich , historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest , " Hardcore-Betonbauten " in the region . 
By 13 countries , their ' trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe ": as well as Germany , Austria and Switzerland , they visited places in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania , Poland - and each year a city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia . 
The 46 -year-old German is a real Badekultur-Enthusiastin . 
With sport they do not have much to everybody says Meder - only in the water is different . 
Annoying that must come to terms with Schwimmfans blue Kacheln and chlorine smell , while betörenden exceeds the smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or can listen to happy already in the park . 
" I asked me one day , why must be swimming pools are always so ugly , " says the Meder living in Vienna . 
" So I started to collect fine pools . " 
Water surface doubled architecture 
Geplätscher leap in the basin and essential Sauna-Öle - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great , because of all the way , so Meder . 
And if have given the builders , can be a real Schwimmhallen Augenschmaus: " instead of the soil has been in bathrooms a surface water . " 
" It is transparent , reflects on the other hand , but the beauty of the whole building . " 
Everything doubled look better: high vaults , colorful Kacheln , leap . 
The kleinformatige picture collar; " bathing , " given to 190 pages of value on the architectural and cultural history historic Wellness-Oasen - but above all , to a leap in the dark . 
Remarkable copies the Pool-Sammlerin discovered Meder her research in Hungary . 
In addition Heilbädern magnificent as the 100 -year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Thermalbad , are filled with alkalihaltigem basin of water and are in a flaschenförmigen buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). 
Spectacular prospects , however , offer many districts Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria , while we have the Zurich Dachbad the whole city , can look in the external pool of Bads in St Anton on the snow covered am - and Dampfbad: there is a window , which can be seen on the activities of the Ski-Piste . 
Perhaps the most extraordinary Pool-Design expected bathing guests in French-beating field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo . 
From three to above--relatively open parings dampft it in the winter , while in the background , the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky . 
Alhambra in the Black Forest 
Not in any swimming pool , the Pool-Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose . 
Many thermal spas smell of sulphur , in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba smells it so strong for fuel oil that believes it is difficult , ended up in a bad health . 
The smell of the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters , is almost dark and whose silt in the skin , as soon as we can be - a Wellness-Erlebnis slip into the basin of the special . 
In one place was Iris Meder in their search for fine bathing sites but also disappointed: When they the freedom and some in the Czech bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit , it was a abgesperrtes terrain . 
The 1902 of architects Duan Jurkovic was bad was closed . 
As Meder threw a look through the window of the verwitterten red and white , yellow Jugendstil-Gebäudes , grown and grown like Topsy between the places . 
The decline has been countered , however , in the same beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in bad Wildbad . 
Three Inntal has this bad already behind , to discover not only neoromanische elements , from the time of its creation in 1844 , but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-Stil , which was added in 1900 . 
Since the careful 1995 modernisation is the Palais Thermal the favourite of the bad Pool-Kennerin Iris Meder - and not only because they originated in the Black Forest . 
" It is quite an achievement , so different Baustile to such a great unity to merge , " Meder says . 
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in Thermalpool apparently only incidental . 
Agri-foodstuffs speculation 
German bank is raw materials business , 
By Christian Teevs 
, the German bank their business with agricultural commodities on ? 
SPIEGEL-ONLINE-Informationen Josef Ackermann has a working group , the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world to examine . 
In January the company wants to be consequences . 
Hamburg - 
To the Federal citizens; it is clear:84 per cent of Germans do not find it according to a study acceptable; speculate that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize . 
Two thirds of respondents demanding that Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions from this business , because it is the problems of the world 's poorest . 
This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organization foodwatch . 
The study is based on a report , the foodwatch in mid-October . 
It shows the author Harald Schumann , that the bets in global commodity markets the prices - and the banks is complicit in the global hunger problem . 
The campaign of the consumer is specifically against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann , even if banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly . 
Originally intended natural-resource-related betting , protect against traders price fluctuations . 
But now , most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits . 
Unlike the US-Konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is " worth it , the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank to gamble . " 
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE International is a working group at the accusations from the Foodwatch-Report . 
By the end of the year should be completed the examination , then be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank , with a recommendation , how to deal with it . 
At the end of January will tell the top of the bank , then the consequences of it . 
In the end could be a reduction of the commodity business , or even the complete departure . 
Ackermann turn to his image 
Foodwatch-chef Thilo Bode welcomed the news , but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: " The betting on rising prices of food shows a particularly vivid , ruthlessly banks today as the common good . " 
Ackermann , the chief lobbyist banks , particularly in the duty . 
" The Deutsche Bank must remove all term-assets from its portfolio , in which money is used for betting on food prices , " said Bode . 
" Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank goes . " 
The clear-mindedness of Mr Ackermann at first glance surprising , but it is clear that the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture . 
On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board . 
With a move away from the controversial agri-foodstuffs speculation he could clean up its image . 
And care for possible reductions it hardly needs to do - that would have finally , his successor . 
Every second Annexes raw materials would announce 
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high . 
To date , more than 30.000 internauts have already taken part in the campaign of the organisation . 
On Tuesday , Bode the survey , for which the institute Forsa on 7 th and 8 th November 1001 people has asked . 
Just eleven percent think it is legitimate for that offers the Deutsche Bank Annexes involving bets on prices for food . 
Many bank customers would also consider personal consequences , if they know that their bank is involved in such high-profit-margin: every second would announce the poll , all installations , which flows of money into the commodity speculation . 
43 per cent would advise friends of such a bank , 49 to reflect , to terminate their account and to move to another institution . 
21 s house in Vienna 
The umgezogene pavilion 
By Mrs Wiensowski 
An architecture history with ups and downs , End happy: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels , 1958 , was in Vienna to the museum , and unladen 's . 
Now he is in the exhibition . 
If of modern architecture Greater , of clear forms , glass , the halls , courageous swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in the technical progress , it is the Austrian pavilion of the architects Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels Expo 1958 a good and famous example . 
Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and completely Stahl-Glas-Konstruktion . 
The construction has , to date as a milestone contemporary architecture . 
He made the architects so well known that the Austrian also in the next World Expo pavilion , . 
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he was 1973 , internationally famous . 
His as a temporary construction planned exhibition pavilion had been drawn up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden in Vienna southern railway station , converted and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20 st century - the ' 20 s , " it was called . 
Was defective and technically the buildings but neither space as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate . 
It was , however , used until such time as the contemporary art in Vienna a new house . 
Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more . 
Now has transformed the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion , he is now " 21 's House " and will be used in future as a museum for contemporary art . 
Tuesday evening opened the museum celebration , which includes the House , where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect . 
Has managed the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco , which was 2007 new member of the Austrian gallery celebration . 
Husslein-arco , qualified art historian with considerable career , in the youth and Eiskunstläufererin , later at Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg , the conversion to politicians and Denkmalschützern , they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and set the use . 
The present art should be issued the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation , a café and a book shop there should be , and an office building had to be built . 
Strict supervision , small budget 
For the operation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation . 
Not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and South-Mediterranean and had won the competition , but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was " incredibly important place ' , in which he " almost every weekend " had read the exhibitions . 
He knew the Ur-Entwurf , and he knew the problems of the building , which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease . 
In the current restructuring there was far greater problems: the buildings was " a Energieschleuder , " Krischanitz says . 
The page-window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special security glass . 
Kältebrücken-stahlträger have been strengthened or replaced , and asbestos full blankets were rescued . 
Two missiles were under way for the new use , a abgesenkter light gap between House and road; provides for the Belichtung , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building , but still the easy Schwanzer-Pavillon . 
The original external doors have remained , the House is deleted in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton . 
And the theatre is exactly the way is even more , as he was in the past . 
And all this under strict supervision of the monument and with a small budget . 
" Often had to be found a material that is good and proper , and was also the Denkmalschutzamt ' , says Krischanitz and points to a raw language in the soil Untergeschoss . 
Despite all the pressures , problems and improvements to the building has remained flexible and easily . 
It was difficult with the pavilion , " came the from Brussels , " said Krischanitz recently , a typical " Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte . " 
I am a architecture " always in the wrong place ' and to ' give a real awareness . " 
In this case is the 21 House; but not in the wrong place , because it is an urban stroke of luck: the Swiss garden there is just the completely new planned " Hauptbahnhofsquartier , with office and residential buildings . " 
And another stroke of luck will be perhaps: The 21 s house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz-Bau , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought out the Berlin art , and we hear that they negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden . 
Rail plans Winter-Krisen-Paket millions in 
The crisis has mapped out a plan to prevent the Zugausfälle in winter . 
The number will be doubled . 
It costs millions . 
In the fight against the winter Zugausfälle and delays are from Deutsche Bahn , according to a newspaper report this year over EUR 70 million . 
The " picture " -Zeitung reported , citing a make inter-group Krisen-Plan in advance , to 2015 are investing a total of around 300 million euros . 
That also ask for a better availability of vehicles and rail network to extreme Witterungen be achieved . 
Is planned , including a doubling of internal and external staff for the snow removal on rail stations and rail rise to 16.000 people . 
Goal is lengthened by the company , and 90 per cent of the necessary course within four to five hours of snow and ice . 
Two months ago had warned rail chief Rudiger , after a meeting with top government and industry cancellations and delays in this winter . 
Last winter , the rail passenger transport significant problems , because it is interests--including in difficult weather conditions in reserves . 
So many new trains for years waiting for approval by the Federal . 
There is a delay in the extradition of ICE-Zügen . 
The power to create for years that they have to examine axes of ICE-Zügen considerably more in the garage , after a ICE in Cologne main station a axes . 
German bank pays millions sentence in the United States 
After the tumult of head Josef Ackermann , new hardships from the US: the Deutsche Bank must pay a million fine . 
As if the problems at home for the Deutsche Bank would not be enough , the industry giants , now , his role in the United States: the Frankfurter Institute in a comparison pays $ 145 million (106 million euros), about disputes because of the failure of five great mutual banks during the financial crisis . 
It is about the sale of mortgage securities . 
The financial market regulators NCUA accuses a number of big banks , the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products to have , and they have played down the risks . 
Such lost papers during the financial crisis , to value and so the banks with in depth . 
" We are satisfied that we have been able to resolve the issue without that the parties had to go to court , " said a Deutsche-Bank-Sprecher in New York . 
The bank acknowledged with the comparison with no guilt . 
This also applies to the Citigroup , which committed itself to the payment of $ 20,5 million . 
The NCUA-Vorsitzende Debbie Matz welcomed the cooperation of the two money; houses . 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is for the US-Genossenschaftsbanken and is responsible for failures to protect the customer no; . 
The formateur NCUA , replaced the damage incurred billions . 
The now closed comparisons are the first of its kind . 
The regulators had seen other big banks attacked and in the summer WaMu; Chase , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued . 
In these mortgage securities are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities . 
This is home loans . 
As the US housing bubble burst in 2007 , this was a wide range of financial firms to fatal . 
In September 2008 , at the height of the financial crisis , turned the US investment bank Lehman Brothers . 
Even if the events quite a few years ago , so the banks are currently in the United States a sharp wind is blowing . 
Investors and regulators have made countless complaints , in order to obtain compensation or to punish wrongdoing . 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has caused the biggest wave action . 
It accuses 18 large international banks that face two state US-Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions to the tune of around $ 200 billion . 
The Deutsche Bank must face up to a complaint from the FHFA , there is a business worth a total of $ 14,2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007 . 
Without the regulator , the Frankfurt for " substantial losses " accountable , however , to give a precise figure . 
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unfounded and , to want to take . 
Warren Buffett is increasing by 10 billion , with IBM 
Financial guru Buffett invested heavily in IT companies IBM . 
Since March it has bought shares in the value of more than ten billion dollars . 
So far , the great American investor Warren Buffett had always , not to invest in IT and computer companies , as the long-term development of the firms would pollero forecast . 
Now , however , he had read the accounts of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the industry . 
He had to understand much earlier that IBM things above all services and computer systems for the IT-Abteilungen other companies beschaffe . 
An investment by Warren Buffett is a knight blow in the financial world . 
This is the IT-Urgestein IBM now " Sir IBM ' . 
Because Buffett revealed in the US economy CNBC station that he had bought since March IBM-Aktien $ 10,7 billion . 
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5,5 per cent . 
Buffett said that not even IBM has been something of the commitment warned . 
He praised the management , which itself had ensured proper profits in the economic crisis . 
" They have done a great job , " said Buffett on the strategy . 
IBM is for some time on the lucrative IT-Services as the operation of data centres . 
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice; and powerful computer companies . 
Buffett had shunned technology firms to date . 
He says that he only invest in companies whose business he also understand . 
Instead , to Buffett in a freight rail , with a Schmiermittel-Hersteller machines or farmers . 
Holding Berkshire Hathaway has around 80 alongside his own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re , the former Munich Rück . 
The 81 -year-olds took in the 1960 s the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world . 
However , his lifestyle is modest . 
It is for many investors in the world a cult figure . 
His almost unmistakable sense for money-making has won him the nickname of " Oracle Omaha " . 
As the Buffett-Investments , the IBM-Aktie vorbörslich to one per cent . 
" Big Blue " , as IBM is known , is in the stock market more than $ 220 billion worth and , therefore , together with Apple and Microsoft on the most valuable technology company in the world . 
At Microsoft , said Buffett , but he would not get involved . 
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend . 
The threat is real 
After the discovery of " Zwickauer cell ' doubt Turkish media on German law . 
One paper even speaks of a " bloody ideology , " the now again auflebe . 
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek micro-businesspeople in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing background . 
This news will react in Turkey and the Turkish German population in Germany with fear and concern . 
For many Deutsch-türken , a long totgeglaubtes specter back: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 , there has been no similar violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks . 
That there is in Germany xenophobia; , was never in question . 
However , the right-wing extremist network , which have been uncovered proportions , whose dimension is not yet in sight . 
' , the bloody idealogy back on ? ' , the Internetausgabe the Turkish newspaper ran the headline " Haberturk . " 
The newspaper Sabah " stressed , however , that should have been one of the perpetrators of a V-Mann constitutional protection , and is concerned that could be involved , German authorities in the fascist-minded quagmire . 
The Turkish community responded , coolly Germany: you reminded over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence . 
Only two weeks ago had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the deutsch-türkischen Anwerbeabkommens . 
In lively colors was the cooperation been set up - as a history of success . 
As a slap in the face , because the rapporteurship some Turkish media: " Germany 's gift for fifty TENs ' is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform " Haber X , " the report the background of the non-Muslim; series . 
Also Deutschlandausgabe ' Hürriyet ' it is not , take these intellectual link . 
" It start to stink , " is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci . 
He stressed that people have been murdered , paid the taxes and would have done with their work is an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany . 
Extremely critical is being discussed in German Turkish Internet forums the actions of the police and the investigation later success . 
Why it was not long before the German authorities either , to search for suspects in extreme right-wing circles , surprised the authors . 
Some shows ready at least rhetorically to drastic measures: " Will done carelessly , remains the migrants; no choice than the self-defense and the weapons . " 
" This will be the best protect themselves . " 
" By the quality of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the internal peace in Germany , " writes " selenium . " 
What it means , if the internal peace in Germany in danger , goal--such the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties . 
The photograph of the ruin of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish . 
Because no other event showed the Turks living here , it is clear that there is a current threat , and Germans--the that mistrust; and distance can result in right-wing violence . 
The attacks , but the Wir-Gefühls knives on the Turkish side . 
The mistakes of the past repeat 
In the Turkish press was criticised at the time , in particular , the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln . 
After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President , represented at the funeral in Cologne but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was on in his speech , as were many charges here the Turks . 
Quite so , than the value of a berechne people after the height of his taxation delivery . 
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again , is how deep distrust many German Turks in the European rule since then . 
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs it this time , open-coordination words . 
The scandal of the Bank Zürisee 
The abenteuerlichste Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland . 
The UBS in the financial crisis nearly bankrupt and slide since then from one crisis to another . 
Now it will be a German . 
So it is certainly not intended Axel Weber . 
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he would take up a 2013 almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step . 
Axel Weber was publicly , praised the Switzerland; whether their beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and the1990 warm remarks about the future colleagues . 
" The UBS has the Turnaround managed . " 
" I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . " 
But back in September , it was clear that everything would be quite different . 
A trader of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and been around EUR 1,7 billion . 
Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald Grübel , not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers , had to go . 
The President of the Board of UBS , since , as has - and ask all: when will finally Axel Weber ? 
Was already known that Weber may discuss the Bank of February 2012 . 
And the board , he is already in May - not only in 2013 , as the bank said on Tuesday . 
For Axel Weber , the hard . 
It is not a banker , economics professor and central bankers and would have had a long time certainly needed . 
With a stroke , he takes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank , which has once again demonstrated , that they have the title " biggest Skandalbank of Europe " deserves . 
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and the slide for years by a scandal in the next . 
Nothing , it seems , is spared the once so proud Swiss bank . 
It started in the financial crisis . 
By 2007 , the UBS has had an excellent reputation . 
The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters it had combined with ambitious objectives: you wanted to be in the investment banking a very large number . 
So the UBS managed 2007 with $ 1,6 trillion more money high-net-worth customers than any other bank in the world . 
And on the other hand it as investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world . 
This made impression . 
Told the former bankers and later a professor banks in Zurich Hans right: " my students I have presented the UBS at the time as a model of good bank . " 
" Today , we wonder: how could I am wrong only ? " 
He wrongly huge . 
In 2007 , for the first time that something great schieflief in the UBS . 
In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising , who was by then as high intellectual and ingenious bankers . 
Some months later it was , how he had gone . 
The investment in the bank , with Subprime-Papieren been and had to write off billions . 
In order to shoulder the , the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs . 
So it was actually investors , but which , on the gerümpft some until shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund , which was not the case that was not even his name . 
But that was only the first blow . 
It was worse in April 2008 . 
The Bank had to announce new billion losses , Board President Marcel Ospel , 2006 of the second best paid board of Switzerland , resigned . 
In October 2008 , following the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state . 
The National Bank , the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities , the Swiss Confederation , six billion francs for a forced change bond that they could be Miteigentümerin the Bank . 
The whole country was shocked , because she has said , as it is for a small country , if it so dramatically large banks . 
After all , the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic). 
" Once again , we could not save the UBS ' , says banks researchers right . 
On the first disaster subscribed to the second . 
A few months later surrendered in the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients , with the help of the bank had evaded taxes . 
Also agreed to a payment of $ 780 million - as a repayment unjustified profits from these shops and Strafaufschlag . 
So that doet the UBS more or less open , in the tax evasion . 
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secretiveness--rooted . 
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same . 
It followed the resignation of head and administration; Council President . 
And the exodus of customers ' money . 
Had lost the bank within a few months their credibility in two key business areas: in investment banking by the false speculation and in the asset management by the aid to tax evasion . 
And just as it has been somewhat calmer , just as it was thought , will now get the UBS it again , because this is unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual traders been EUR 1,7 billion , before the bank , that something was wrong . 
And it seems to be: in the risk management in the investment banking works out there are obviously still not . 
" With the case Adoboli has to be said that has changed the risk control too little , " says Martin Janssen , an economist and professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich . 
Also the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is sure of the UBS: " The problem is that they do not control , the risk control . " 
It was just the idea of caution , which were the Swiss bankers for a long time to be guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too many risks , and safety for money - was also collapse across the Alps of the world . 
The coffers of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate . 
The office of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the excellent Swiss private bank - yet it is just a little bit bigger . 
The situation is classic; . 
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße , from the Central Station , directly to the Zürichsee , of the will of the Letná summits of the Swiss mountains frames . 
The buildings here are magnificent , , the shop rents are among the highest in Europe . 
Jewellers as Tiffany 's here between Swiss tradition , such as the Confiserie Sprüngli . 
Stay here for centuries the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius bear . 
The reception of the Hemicycle UBS is through a revolving door . 
Are dressed in the marble walls , be thick leather chair , along with the logo of a great sign for " safe . " 
The UBS knows what the customer wants: security here . 
This idea of Swiss Bank have both big Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , has , however , eventually betrayed - or , as the head of a small Swiss private bank . 
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper , finally , he , like all Swiss bankers , also deals with the two big banks . 
The UBS has become far too big , he - especially in investment banking , where would spread the Anglo-Saxons . 
The Swiss have nothing more to say . 
" And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons . " 
Indeed , it was the Anglo-saxon investment banking , which changed the UBS , its only high profits , and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the Subprime-Dschungel as much money as the Swiss large bank . 
On 15 October 2008 , the disaster was visible . 
" On that Wednesday , the coalition government of the seven million small country the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation , " writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book " The UBS-Crash . " 
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros approved the politicians , in order to save the bank before the bankruptcy . 
How could this happen ? 
When you talk with Swiss bankers , so they see the problem , in the size of the UBS . 
In June 1998 , up two of the three big Swiss banks to a huge company . 
It was a bank , which has been in the merger was too large for the small Switzerland; - and further and further grew up . 
It helped that the two different Vorläufer-Banken supplemented the UBS: a rich , but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but even more internationalized . 
Suddenly the globalised investment banker favourable much money , with which it is a huge wheel . 
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli , president of the UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , the chairman of the board at the time . 
" I always thought , Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team , " says banks researchers Hans right . 
" Wuffli , the intellectuals , Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics , and Ospel belly , the person who has worked , from the bank lesson to the top . " 
But Ospel have ended up on Wuffli . 
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: " He thought that his models were the reality , " says sound right . 
" This is a tragic case . " 
Tragic , perhaps . 
It is clear: embolden came before the fall . 
The UBS remember clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings on which to group chief Wuffli always have the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone . 
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world . 
It was the " League Tables ' , the rankings , which documented the success of the banks that time . 
Then wanted to UBS , after at the top . 
Some steps were in it . 
In the foreign exchange and stock in trade , with it at the top . 
Business advisers who have been charged , stressed , however , a weakness: the international interest in business , the bankers , " Fixed Income , " there is a huge gap to the largest banks . 
The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products . 
In order to close this gap , UBS in an adventure , which they almost cost the existence . 
Hungry for growth , both the Bank and invested a newly-established hedge funds in American Subprime-Anlagen before it . 
It has become a huge machine , the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and , post-Napoleonic - but it also risks . 
Also , as were other banks for the exit . 
" Even in the summer of 2007 , when the American property market in flames , has bought the UBS there , " says banks expert; right . 
So great the euphoria , so deeply the case . 
A manager after another had to go as compared with the attempts organization--one more difficult . 
Items in the UBS were the weapon and are still shaky . 
Who the bank now , has an almost impossible job . 
He needs to find a strategy for a bank of all nearby business models are strangely . 
Banks researchers right already has an idea: stop the investment banking , focus on asset management , return to the Swiss roots . 
The bank will not (yet) go quite so far . 
But the investment-banking activities should shrink sharply , it is already clear . 
On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy . 
The 51 -year-old Italo-Schweizer was intended only as a temporary solution , and divided the Bank is surprising of predecessors; Grübel . 
Now authoritarian-would-be-democratic it: it is the business of UBS , told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday . 
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level in the mid-1990s . 
3500 posts cut it . 
This will not be enough . 
The UBS needs a vision . 
Who is it ? 
What do they earn money ? 
Those are the questions that is Axel Weber safe; now . 
Publicly he says so far , only that he would seek with his wife in a home in Zurich . 
Next year .

Intelligent Krähen broad in cities from 
In many places , Saatkrähen as " problem " birds , but from the cities to drive the highly intelligent animals longer , experts say . 
The one they may , the other would get rid of them very quickly: Krähen , for centuries to the city , but in many local authorities are Anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals . 
This is a remedy for the birds ' problem ' not yet in sight . 
Saatkrähen were to get out of the cities , not more , said specialists on the first Krähensymposium , in ostfriesischen Leer . 
They discussed experts from the entire area of possible ways . 
They are looking for alternatives in the cities 
Conservationists have led to the problems in cities on the land of the most protected Saatkrähen: the chemicals used in agriculture contributing to the traditional habitats . 
The hunting , in and the cases of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds . 
Krähen are under nature conservation . 
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren , among other things , the Westphalian Soest , in the north-west in Jever , Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and in Leer . 
Www.securityjam.org had 2005 a controversial project to mass killing of Krähen in the district for Negativ-Schlagzeilen . 
Critics have described the trapping of animals and birds in the clubbing with clubs as particularly brutal . 
" The normal expulsion , the Vergrämen , nothing , " said the landscape and urban planners Werner Klöver from Leer . 
Nests with water wegspritzen or cut down trees , often have unintended consequences , also said the gases; Manfred emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württember . 
" The animals from , large colonies divide on and in other places . " 
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals , old people 's homes or schools . 
" We have to live with them , we can give them no longer away . " 
Without the surrounding area could not solve the problem in the cities , said Mayor Wolfgang waiter for Leer . 
Is a possible combination of animals from Vergrämen sensitive Wohnbereichen and bait advertising , to enable them to return . 
" Information panels , chain saws " was the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals , " a Pickel in face; ' we can finally best self-confident . " 
Jürgens had were in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Berger; Krähen-Lehrpfad , to inform the signs on the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen . 
The project will now already adopted by tourists . 
Also had to criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgens opinion: " there is a lot of communication , which have much to say . " 
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen use not only tool , to come to a biscuit , but as a tool their tools even itself . 
All of the University of Cambridge quiet where recently in four Saatkrähen , how far the intelligence of the birds . 
In an experiment the birds learned quickly that they must bring stones down a framework , a Mottenlarve . 
Without much training they purposefully , the size and shape of a stone must have the platform . 
In a second attempt to resolve the smart Krähen then a kniffligeres problem . 
In a vertical pass , had placed the researchers a small bucket with a Mottenlarve . 
With these could not achieve the birds of prey . 
However , the researchers had made them bare-wire . 
It shaped all four animals a catch , with which they angelten then the bucket of the control of the bag . 
Three of the four Saatkrähen , this even " .

Mass slaughter on a personal level 
Begins sensitive and generous Peter Englunds new book ' beauty and horror . Told a story of the First World War , in nineteen giants ' with a long list of players , the anticipate--a to heart . 
This is a piece of advice that could be as: Cut from this side of you and make you to read your sign . 
They are these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative to know each other very well , and these players will be your GPS function , as a beacon in just a few moments , in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and your illusions . 
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist . 
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature . 
He has written an unusual book , which he does not , describes as " a work of the Anti-Geschichte " inappropriate . 
It contains only a few big names , major contracts or miracle-working battles , there is little ambassadors , racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment . 
It is less a book on what happened , he says , but rather " a book about how it was . " It is about " feelings , impressions , experience and moods . " 
" Beauty and horror " almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war , of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountain increase , doctors , ambulance drivers and office workers . 
Some of these people to be heroes . 
Some will lose to prisoners of war , be born , crazy or die . 
Each of these lives future has come as the Votivkerzen in a church , some , while another lapse . 
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books . 
It is also the idea that the first world war was just the devastating war , on the west front . 
" Beauty and horror ' is with experts view of other war theaters: the Alps , the Balkans , the Ostfront , Mesopotamia , East Africa . 
To the soldiers in this book , bee-related baskets , is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt , Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem . 
This is almost from the outset a moving book . 
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster , like a hurricane; Katrina , the smells of the Kordit . 
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children , and cannon fire in the distance . " You or you take the flight ? 
Who is at all ? 
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being waged at all . 
" Lack of facts , " Englund finds , " were on assumptions assumptions , hopes , fears , hare-brained ideas , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumours contribute . " 
" Beauty and horror " of individuals such as Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian army , and Richard root , a young German ship sailors . 
Their stories have been Africa-centric memories , letters and other already (material removed . 
Their life reports can be shocking or simple , but they are very alive in Englunds details in the possession of small moments . 
Many of them act of shortages and aban Behelfen . 
In the history of a German Schulmädchens he is telling: " replacement , substitute everywhere . " 
' replacement aluminum coffee , wrong , wrong eraser , paper , wood buttons . " 
He tells more of the replacement eat in Germany . 
He describes ' meat , which made large rice and was struck in Hammelfett (and least was served with a false bone from wood), tobacco , which was made from dried roots and dried and potato , shoes , which were besohlt with wood . " 
It was , as he noted , " In 837 , spare funds , which were allowed in the manufacture of sausages , 511 registered coffee spare resources . " 
Some stories act of honour and bravery . 
An American recognises his own drive to the ferocity and says about the war: " We feel that this is in spite of everything , rather than for men , was to sit in the Lehnstuhl , with the evening , or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand , and to do so , as is such a veneer of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast . " 
Conversely , acknowledges a British soldier that he probably die and nobody notice or would be done . 
" If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves , , we would like to think that this is happening in front of a crowd , " he writes . 
Instead , it is so terrible as " a convicted man who was hanged in secret . " 
Other observations of the old Europe act , which does not fall apart , and on new kinds of terror . 
" The conflict was becoming an increasingly economic competition , " Englund writes , " a war between the factories . " 
He starts the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the Bestiarium of young century ' , ' the word streamlined and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick , the slaughter , while he is sitting behind a desk . " 
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is also frivoles behaviour as heroic . 
Englund is the soldiers who were actively being infected with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease , in order to escape the front . 
" The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade with Gonokokken-Eiter , because soldiers and on their genitals grease , in the hope that , come to the hospital , " he writes . 
" Those who were really desperate , rieben him in the eyes , which led to the rest of their lives they were blind . " 
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves will Englunds versemongering elastic and intrusiveness and fits in perfectly with his human task . 
In dozens of small scenes is he the kind and a way , as the war " has a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . " 
The people are starting to ask why their leaders they bring to the fighting . 
The best books about the First World War were distorted as Paul Fussells ' Great War and Modern Memory " or novels like Erich Maria Remarques " nothing new " in the West as extensive history books . 
Englunds band is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle . 
His book has the most devastating end , of which I have ever read in a Sachbuch . 
There is no longer tells me . 
But it is as if he snapped up with his book this side of the main people in the face and lit with a coup--Nigeria wood . 
After an early was a meticulously planned attack 
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them , use helmets . 
We had opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday , because at this time are very few people in the Zucotti Park . 
The operation has been kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed and all the other thought initially to take part in an exercise . 
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was right in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges . 
As the onset of the events of the last few weeks has been blinded against protesters , in violation of the rules of the Dezernats and the Hausbesetzern an enormous growth in public clienteles , do not occur again . 
And so the police on the removal of the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of the planning and training . 
Officials had prepared this , by you , such as in other cities were handled . 
A Katastrophenübung had taken place with a view to Zuccotti ultra-peripheral space in Iceland . 
Officials increased the so-called Chaos-Schulung - measures to combat terrorism , including the rapid displacing a large number of police officers - to focus in order to lower Manhattan . 
The last training unit was held Monday night at the Manhattan-Seite of the East River . 
The order , in the park , " in the last minute , " said someone who is familiar with the command , which for a declaration as " exercise . " 
" The few police officers , who I know were wateringdown , did not know that it came to the 's Zuccotti Park , " said someone who wishes to remain anonymous . 
" The only , knew that it went to Zuccotti Park , the senior officials of the portfolios . " 
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned . 
Officials wanted the park on 14 October , differed back then but , when hundreds of Protestlern , after they had received from these plans . 
Officials of various police forces were involved in the operation on Tuesday , including forces from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials , which are normally used in over-speculate criminal neighborhoods . 
Mr Kelly said that , in the course of the day , many people in the park and out , almost as travel; , so that 1 p.m. in the night is a good time to things . 
" It was appropriate to do so , when is the least number of people in the park , " he said . 
Ambulances with Jupiterlampen and loud speakers , prior to the departure of the Pike panties and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge . 
The light bulbs and the first recorded news , the dröhnten from the loud speakers , rail brow-beat many protesters . 
As broke the public officials in their bright blue Windjacken in the park , rafften together many protesters simply their belongings and left the place . 
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 p.m. , in order to give the Protestlern time , their homes and possessions together . 
Other teams of officials were seen as they collected in the environment to intervene , should be arrests in the park . 
Reporters have been forced to leave the park . 
Paul J. Browne , spokesman for the police chief; , said that this has happened to their own security . 
But many journalists say that they wanted to hold them , the police actions in the park to see , and they said , the way in which the officials is very harsh . 
Mr Browne said that Fernsehwagen in the Church Street on the west side of the parks; photographs could have . 
When the police in west by the great confusion to personal matters of protesters , including bags , art lawn and home with clothes , turbulent , followed by the employees of the city , which removed , which had been left behind . 
Some protesters , who refused to go , have been out towed . Images of this already short time later on the Internet . 
One of the main core of Protestlern was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park . 
Some barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests . 
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp did ancient in her arms . 
And two people would chain themselves to trees , said Mr Kelly . 
Civil protection officials were called , they loszuschneiden . 
As Mr Kelly has said , there have been no arrests until around 3:30 p.m. in the park . 
The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes . 
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in Park . 
To most of the arrests took place , as he said , because " disorderly conduct and resisting arrest . " 
The most prominent officials on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito , the head of the department , the top uniformed officials of the department . 
Phil T. Pulaski , department head of the Detectives , was also there . 
Despite his presence ' , " Mr Kelly " not the operation , " said Mr Browne . 
In the event that they should have access , a second group of officials from the eastern side of the Broadway , between Liberty and Cedar Street . 
In the Cortlandt Street , a road block north of the parks , and in the Pine Street , a block further south , built barricades; . 
It could be observed , as these sites from the police the field continue to Zuccotti park as well . 
In a place has been observed , as several officials , many of them with protection , signs , people out . 
Around 28 people were in the northern area . 
Some of the most violent actions of the night , in the south of the parks . 
Around 5 p.m. jumped south of the Pine Street a protesters on the roof of a police car and other demonstrators , the air in the tyre of a police bus . 
Raised the amount a piece of Sperrholz in one place . 
In the end , a government official and the protesters to hospital . 
Trade union the guide; will because redundancy; lodge a complaint against the city 
The trade union , the hundreds of Schulbetreuern who have lost their jobs last month , , is planning to sue the city on Wednesday , as the redundancies; because of undue influence on the schools , keep the poor students , are not necessary and discriminatory . 
The complaint is probably the last opportunity , the trade union , local 37 , in their efforts , the redundancy; to reverse--North , still is open . 
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer , care coordinators and other staff who are the worst paid employees of the city , and had lost on 7 October in a move their work , have described the trade union leaders and political revenge for that last year the city of access to a health fund , which had the working groups , had refused to close the budget gap . 
These accusations have been flatly rejected by the authorities . 
Said at a hearing of the council Dennis M. Walcott , director of the schools , last month , the redundancies are part of the budget that we have in June . 
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that spezifiziere in the budget that would be off the Schulhilfe . 
Officials said the city of 37 , they would have and warned the Ministry of Education , a complaint; on Wednesday there will be a press conference to be announced the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally . 
The complaint , Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as defendants list and count eight laid-off workers as the plaintiff , which are all color or Latin American women , as most of the workers who have lost their jobs . 
Elizabeth Thomas , a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city , said that the city would be the case not and therefore could not comment on their individual claims . 
According to a complaint before the draft , the New York Times , the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city , in order to support a complaint alleging discrimination , claiming that would have lost poor schools more workers , because they are chronically under-funded . 
It points out that , while there was no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in schools 's Upper East Side or TriBeCa , 17 Schulhelfer district in 23 in Louisville , Brooklyn Brown , have lost and 46 workers were made redundant in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx . 
With the adoption of the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern , in the 36 public school in Harlem , where 68 percent of students live in poverty , were employed , says the case: " This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents , can organise the donations to offset budget cuts . " 
P.S.: the budget of the 36 th southern has been cut this year by 3,26 , and lost money , as the city changed its method of calculation for the extra funding for any poor school enrolment . 
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in the memo , which approved the release of care coordinators . 
The memo used the English word " excess " to describe the act , even if quot; excess ': hand) in the United States is typically the change of a teacher of the payroll at a school in a pool of available workers , who are paid by the central office . 
" Sixty care coordinators have been made redundant , not handed over , " says the complaint . 
Mission ended , Congress prepared to agree on Libya 
It ultimately looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington already , in terms of the uprisings in Libya . 
All , was what we needed , was the success of the revolt , the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and an end to the American interference . 
On Thursday , the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution , which the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is , with Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their " courage " Brittan; . 
" This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya , which started with the reconstruction of their country , " said Kerry . 
" It is a validation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties . " 
The language may sound innocent , but so far nothing was simply in the Libya debate . 
This summer strove legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the US military 's role in the Libyen-Mission ΝΑΤΟ . 
In June , Kerry and McCain a resolution , which approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya . 
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote . 
But on the same day , this law in the Senate by the chamber . Right-by-right outvoted a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya . 
This US , the mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress , which was upset enough to criticise Obama 's approach within the mission , but not angry enough to him once and for all the rug from under our feet . 
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events . 
Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October . 
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October . 
Now the Senate may be willing to take action . 
The resolution of the Committee for international relations " congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their exceptional perseverance in their own liberation " and " praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners , the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya , for their exceptional courage and professionalism . " 
The resolution also repeated " the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya 's transition to democracy . " 
The new measures will receive the full support of the board to foreign relations or they will be the -legislators divide , as it has done the law in June ? 
The final version is resistance on the part of the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republikaner of the committee . 
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he so far have not yet seen the final version of the new law . 
The Capitol , the onus is on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment , which calls for a balanced budget , a top priority in almost every Congress , the Republicans and some Democrats . 
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other sector , which is the time to vote in the Senate or Congress . 
Other legislators have been trying unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote , although they have tried often enough . 
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented this Congress and include a whole range of issues . 
Some are twice - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - other , are only slightly . 
There are at least 15 versions of the Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung alone in the Senate and a controls--another dozen , the ' federal spending would control " . 
Some of the laws are different , but they give their customers - especially in the two Republicans , their CV want - the opportunity to boast about , that that they have such a measure " drafted; " . 
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz , which was approved in August , requires that both Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the increased at all; . 
In March 58 senators have not voted for a binding resolution , which supports the idea of such a change . 
On the budget , want to some members of the number of provisions , can present the members of Congress , limit , while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms in office of the President . 
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee , among other things , the right to a good education and health care . 
An amendment that prohibits a marriage of equals forgender , as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags , a recurring . 
Some legislators want to allow for the lifting of federal laws , if not two thirds of the states . 
So keen , as the members suggest changes , so incomparably faster they move as in recent years . 
In the 111 th Congress , before legislators 77 such changes in the 110 th Congress in 66 . 
The pace pales in comparison with that of the early 1990 s , in which were members of more than 150 changes every two years , so the figures , which is the Senate library . 
But they were not too much more successful than today 's . 
The last change that needs to be added - the 27 th - , was ratified in 1992 , but has in fact already proposed to Congress in 1789 . 
' , but not defeated , " Giffords in the first television interview after the attack 
Ten months after an armed man from next indeed; during an election event in Tucson on they had shot , the Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) on Monday evening on national television . Alone; they sang the Broadway-Stück ' The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow " and said that the desire to recover , is greater than the returning to Congress . 
As they , together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-Nachrichten " 20 / 20 " occurred , they struggled for words and needed help in walking . 
The programme was the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet , the shared her skull , durchbohrt the left side of her brain and has broadened its head from start to finish , has done . 
Three months ago , she returned surprising in the Congress to make their voice heard on Schuldenbremse triumphantly . 
In her first television interview after the attack in January , which killed six people and injured 13 , smiling Gifford , laughed and song - and described their recovery as " difficult . " 
As Sawyer they asked how they feel , said Gifford (41): " quite well . " 
The interview with Gifford and her husband , the astronauts Mark Kelly , was part of a one-hour " 20 / 20 " -Specials , which was recorded just before the publication of the new book of the couple: " Gabby: a story of courage and hope . " 
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January . 
In videos , the Kelly recorded in the first few weeks , you see it in the hospital bed , with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the face . 
It can only one or two fingers , if her husband it encouraged . 
Months later , Giffords in a wheelchair , while therapists , showing them how simple movements . 
A nodding head with the Oxfam-International . 
A twitch with the lips . 
And then , their first words: ' what ' . 
After a few days ago whispering Giffords is another word , " Confusion . " They want to , that will change their breakfast . 
Videos , in the ABC-Show , show that music played an important role in Giffords ' recovery: It is , as the members of Congress who , together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers " Girls Just Wanna Have Fun " and to Tom Pettys quot; Free Fallin ' " singing . 
Said in the interview with Sawyer Giffords , the therapy will spend two hours a day , that they can not remember on the day of the attack . 
Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March an article in a newspaper on the attack had , when it cut off , and for the first time after the six people asked , which had been killed during the attack . 
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and will forcibly treated , while he was waiting for his trial . 
" Many people have died , " Giffords told Sawyer . 
" Hard , hard , hard . " 
In the course of the recovery of his wife , Kelly told Sawyer , she said: " I was taken . " 
" So , I would say: ' Gabby , you President; defeated not ? ' , " said Kelly . 
You President; taken only . 
And you will go through it and you will you recover and you will come back stronger than ever before . 
Troops feel more sympathy than respect 
The event was a Wall Street-Gala , collected the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City . 
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness , frustration and loss . 
On cue hundred soldiers , sailors , pilots and marines gathered around him . 
The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded . 
" The servicemen and women were seen as heroes , " said David Saltzman , who organised the effort in the spring . 
A senior military officer at the gala , which among other things , the chief of staff and former chairman , has been observed Admiral Mike Mullen , the role of the troops . 
" They were introduced as orphans , " the officer wrote in an e-mail . 
I am sure that the organisers have said it well . 
I know that . 
But there was no respect , not really , it was pity; . 
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and of the most distant , sometimes admiring American public . 
The troops are showered with praise for their victims . 
But the praise has a price , service members . 
The public is increasingly so , as would the people in uniform suffering . 
" We were not victims , " said brigade Fiscalía Sean example MacFarland , the troops in Iraq or free and will soon go to Afghanistan . 
" But it seems that the only way the support that is , in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate . " 
The issue is very sensitive for military leaders , not ungrateful or in the dispute with the public they serve , to appear . 
Also recognise that the anger , the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War , was much worse . 
As a result there are discussions on pity; in the Pacific and private sector between war veterans . 
With his two sons returned from fighting with the marines , warned the retired Colonel Mark Cancian it that could see people outside the military world their service from two different perspectives . 
Some would see it with a sense of reverence , as they defeated rebels and went to exotic places . 
Others would ask whether a " angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , " said Cancian , who had fought in Iraq and has taken on his return a key state posts in Washington . 
During his job search , he said , he felt that they obtain some of the interviewer subtly , whether he is in a position to withstand immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington . 
" If you only talk about your service , you need the negative impressions are fighting , " declared Cancian his sons . 
The lack of ease of the American military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war . 
Services will be on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and only see little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , only rarely as encomia singled out . 
" We as a nation , not military heroism more so , as it was in the Second World War , absolutely , " said Lieutenant General David Barno retired , inspired the US troops in Afghanistan . 
Instead , the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of service members . 
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks , which they have endured , the number of friends that they have lost or for the severity of their injuries . 
Military is under growing pressure from the crackdown in rape 
This week is an important hearing on whether to be indicted 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape in the military court . 
It should not happen , there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing . 
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers . 
It was in October 2008 and they just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego the dinner with a friend , when they met at a male colleagues , the one he Pack; beer in 12 . 
He asked them , whether he is likely to accompany them along a drink in her room . 
My alarm went to " , " Lyman said . 
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns . 
I thought: ' Oh , no , he is 19 . 
He is from Texas , " she said . 
" I wish I had listened to my gut instincts . " 
A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind it , put it down and raped them , it claims . 
This week , on 18 November , wait; Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , which will decide whether a complaint , it against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , have made , will be allowed in court . 
The complaint alleges that Gates and not Rumsfeld against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers . 
Rose to 28 in February by Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , D.C. , the complaint initially covered 17 claimants , but in the coming months:25 women and three men , all of which claim that they were raped by Soldatenkollegen or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks , available to it . 
Burke says she has the top military leadership , as will the problem there . 
" The military is hierarchical , " she says . 
" Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliate; of ? The leadership . " 
Burke also says that she has contacted since February approximately 400 more survivors , many of them could be part of future complaints . 
Their strategy: instead of all the plaintiff adduces lay their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints , in order to maintain the pressure . 
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence , led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride , has made an application to reject . 
The files of the court , the Newsweek , in detail the defence strategy , primarily for the military , not of current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for injuries , which have occurred in the armed forces . 
Because of a law of the Supreme Court , which dates from 1950 , the so-called Feres-Doktrin , the government is not responsible for violations , the soldiers on active service . 
" The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs , " states the document . 
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story . 
Things have changed since the 1950 s . 
If women are not permitted to service is still in the fight , it is the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts . 
Team of female soldiers increasingly important roles to play in both Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly in the contact with local women in the war zones . 
The result: between the two wars , 150 soldiers have died , two thirds of them in hostilities . 
It is time that will modernize the military , says Burke . 
And it is not alone in their struggle as: three further complaints are out of their pending . 
At Yale Law School , the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four most important military colleges because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere . 
This is independent of the voluntary Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military , to be out the diagnosis " personality disorder " focused , received the rape victims , in order to release them from the service - a way in which the activists as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women 's Action Network , a human rights group . 
Their group was in December complaint against the veteran administration (of .: management of war veterans), in which they did their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people , saying the , have been sexually abused in the service . 
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties submitted to the Congress , which will provide a number of leads . 
In 2010 , according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (sposi .: Department of Defense Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) 3.158 sexual abuses . 
But the majority of the abuses are not reported at all and , after the own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19.000 cases , which it per year . 
The report , which was published in March , is also examining the Strafverfolgungsraten:2010 was 20 percent of the cases in the military , only half as many as in the civil law in court . 
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of non-newsworthy . 
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack . 
In the night , she says , has been asked it 11 times , the details of the rape of a number of police officers , doctors and to tell commanders . 
They had a rape set and the blood of the shooter that arose from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed . 
Six months later , in April 2009 , was heard by a judge . Lyman during this hearing was asked after the sex , they had before the attack with her friend . 
Six people have said , as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was acquitted . 
" I well remember the day when the verdict was read out , " Lyman says . 
" I thought the labor would use . I ran screaming from the courtroom . " 
" They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that I , when I go back to my commander , said: this was not his procedure . That was my procedure . " 
Lyman has been invited to visit a military psychiatrist , a personality disorder diagnosed and said for service . 
In January 2010 , it was honorably discharged , so that they have no support . 
Whether the complaint , the Lyman and the other plaintiff , have tabled , is pure speculation , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School . 
Nonetheless , it says: " in my opinion they should move forward . " 
What stands between them and a judgment , is this doctrine , criticised the will , for the first time since she was called into question . 
I am a critic of the time life Feres-Doktrin . 
The military is lagging behind a decade , because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence , which is a liability . 
He adds: " The chances are against it ... but it is important for them that they try it . " 
These things will only change , if good people are ready to fight . 
If the hearing is not their way , Burke , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , start with hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases . 
" We will continue our struggle against the military in this regard , until it comes to reforms , " she says . 
Or until we die , whatever the first disposal; . 
Walls have eyes: how researchers you watch on Facebook 
Before he was a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe , was Anders Behring Breivik , only one of many boys , which was its anti-immigration views online . 
On Monday had Breivik , who has been , in a killing spree in Norway in July , in which 77 people were killed , his first public court hearing . 
Although Breivik may have acted alone , he is not far from alone in cyberspace;: he has spent much time until his attack on his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists , support the extreme right-wing groups on social networks . 
After the tragedy this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people . 
But as we find them ? 
This is easy - we must EUDemocrats.org only on Facebook . 
" We have found that it was not difficult , to go to them , " says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe . 
Facebooks and personal data is so enzyklopädisch , says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply Werbetool the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - as do retailers for years . 
Bartletts team was half a million fans of far-right groups in Europe and visierte to them with Adds , but rather than with a new collar; or to set a new diet product , have invited the Adds users to a survey in which , after their level of education , was asked its attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future . 
Thanks to Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues were in a position to more than 10.000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even once her office that they would have had to leave . 
" It is a fairly new research method , " says Bartlett . 
Some of the results hardly surprising . Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young , male and resent the immigration . 
But in a kind of surprising mispresentation " those who their online activism with a Offline-Aktivismus combine sensible , democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens . " 
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to welcome a new tool in the hands of scientists . 
Ideas; factories , medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to society; trends such as " Likes ' , text messages and status updates . 
With more than 800 million active users , which add an average of three content per day , generated Facebooks " data supernova explosion " a research multiplier-accelerator , the number of scientific work under the name of this side in the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase . 
For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that we can study this side people , you normally with his Clipboard not achieved in the streets . 
" If you tried to ask people to the British National Party , earlier , it was very difficult to identify them . " 
" They were the first party and which would have given them never access , " says Bartlett . 
' on Facebook is a everything away - you will go directly to them . " 
Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve . 
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook , significantly more problem drinking are as students who remained silent on this issue . 
Moreno proposes that equal students , for example , the Wohnberater , monitor and help a postet these students , if too many status updates . 
" You can 't solve a problem , if you have not recognized , " said Dimitri Christakis , Morenos Ko-Autor and director of the Child Health , Behavior and Development at Seattle Children 's Research Institute of the Washington Post . 
" We have found a way to identify children at risk , the different; had not been found . " 
Facebook also zapft constantly the data of its own people . 
The data team has statistics on the side of the relationship status and Valentine 's Day , the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National bliss-inducing index (which have been used in the first place , has only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have known for a long time that should make the side their great data treasure trove for other for research purposes .) 
But the users of Facebook , know that the side they observed , whether they like it or not . With a friend , which is thousands of miles away , to play Scrabble , the side 's own personal data will be allowed . 
But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey that they do not even know something ? 
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down , as they collect their data offline , is online . 
" I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that researchers have their profiles could study , " says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab , a study in 2006 , in which he investigated the public sides of students on Facebook . 
" What they are concerned , it was only for them and their friends . " 
Then there is the question of the methodology . 
Even offline , there is no guarantee that is a research participants absolutely honest . 
On Facebook , it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a profile and in contributions are true . 
" What you on Facebook says and what we do outside of Facebook , are two completely different things , " says Selwyn . 
Therefore , Selwyn despite his years as a technology that researchers are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools , can use the each . 
" There is no substitute for it to go in the real world and to speak with real people , " he says . 
" Social research must take care of the social aspects - lots and lots of social life is still offline . " 
" Cold and inhuman ": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court 
Behring Breivik , the man , the two Amokläufe differently , in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway , turned himself in his first appearance before a public court described as a " resistance " kämpfer in Oslo . 
" I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple of Norway , " he said in a court room with more than 500 people . 
" I object to the court , because you have had your mandate of organisations , the hatred ideologies; support and is supported by the Multi-culturalism . " 
" I recognise the laws , but I confess I am not guilty . " 
Judges Torkjel Nesheim off Breivik during this monologue , " because he did not want to Breivik , the possibility that this hearing to use as a platform on which he can express his views . " 
For the same reason he Breivik , the speech mitbrachte compiled an advance , permission , at the end of the hearing to speak to the relatives of his victims . 
Nesheim also ordered that the police further Breivik for 12 weeks in custody , he has four weeks do not have access to the media , he said that the authorities all visits and all the correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring . 
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing . 
Some , in the hope that Breivik in the eyes can see other wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars . 
All participated with the aim that everything on a Wegschließen . 
" I thought he was cold and inhuman , " a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK . 
" It was uncomfortable , but for me it is a little further , after I have seen and heard the suspect . " 
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and , throughout the hearing calmly and professionally , he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes , as he entered and left the building . 
Despite Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger " resistance " bewegung , the judge came to the conclusion that he is not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he would have had accomplices . 
It may have some that the attacks of 22 July , the work of a single extremists and this was not a radical group . 
But relieved that automatically the heartache and the confusion that feels a whole nation still ? 
" I wish that he would like a monster , but that does not do it , " said the family of a victim . 
" It would be so much easier if he did . " 
7 lessons from the interviews with the late Steve Jobs , was shown this week in a theatre 
Compared to the death of Steve Jobs on October 5 , some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology; genius as a great modern inventors . 
What are Apple-Fans but perhaps the most in the recently discovered Jobs-Interview , which has been dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets , is how has this very creative head; business processes and procedures . 
He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and even appointed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous detail organizer , the bastelte to Diagrammen - a man who believed that many business leaders " a disease of thought , ' that ' is a really great idea 90 per cent of the work ... [ but ] there is a huge amount of craft-type art between a great idea and a great product . " 
1995 , Bob Cringely the TV series ' triumph of the computer . Fachidioten " with the dawn of the staff and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs , in the one of the rare , detailed talks led . 
At that time were passed over 10 years , since then had been pushed jobs; from Apple , and already he was working hard on his new computer companies NeXT , and looked forward to the broad adoption of the Internet . 
While used a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots , he says that the lack of Kopiervorlagen interviews in the supply . 
Only after Jobs death discovered a full VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director . 
This easy; revised film material is the basis for the 68 film of " Steve Jobs: The Lost interview , " which is this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater . 
For someone who is known for its extensive interviews , jobs here surprisingly busy in its technological philosophies and business strategies . 
And incredibly pause . 
In the course of the interview it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen , where jobs is clearly his thoughts balance and accuracy . 
There are moments in which jobs ' perfect days , when he apparently impatiently awaiting Cringelys issues to react and it anschubst , faster on issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance . 
Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone seems somehow that people interview included far-sighted , if jobs , what other companies with him right or wrong and its own vision for the future of the computer . 
It is a thing; posthumous awards the career jobs ' to read , but jobs here as the thrill of greedy dreamer to see , which is on the leap to the grandeur , is something quite different , original and inspiring . 
He has a vision of how things could be and should be . 
Shortly after he had said all this here , he drew and made it . 
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the Verlorenen interviews: 
As he learned to lead a company: 
" Throughout the years in the business I always ask , " Why are you doing things ? " And the answer , you always get is , ' Oh , it will be easy . " 
Who knows why he does what he is doing , nobody in the business to think very carefully about things . 
I have noticed that . 
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline from , the accounting; Apple . 
Were amazed to see costs recorded - predominantly began with " Standardkosten " , the mere suspicion been costed and which were then adapted with " deviation " - it developed an automated factory , who ensured that the recurring costs until the regulations could be determined . 
As has been veralbert the Pope: 
Jobs; told of the " Blue Box , " which he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device , with the people in the telephone company creep and could lead to talks in vain . 
Has been on the machine , but jobs enthusiasm , as he describes the bluebox as an act of Selbstbemächtigung , is contagious . 
He describes how he Wozniak and test the box; would , by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone , and then working a phone call from a AT in another , while it so many durchschleifen satellites as possible . 
" We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if we grölte into the phone , came a minute later in the telephone next door , " said kichernd jobs . 
" We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves , can control the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world . " 
We both , we did not know much , but we were able to build this small things that can monitor a huge thing , it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them . 
Sake; tells us further away from a glorious gimmick , the Wozniak and he almost made have withdrawn , in the middle of the night via bluebox in the Vatican phoning and wanted to talk with the Pope , while it as far as they could Henry Kissinger nachmachten . 
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to have been called in to speak with the American diplomats , the two loslachen , before the Pope to the telephone . 
As he is in the technology; president (Bill Hewlett and unprepared dispute): 
At the age of 12 , when it was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters , he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him . 
Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call , jobs for the summer work part-time in Hewlett-Packard . 
" This has had a remarkable impact on me and it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company; and how well his staff treated . " 
Later , Jobs one of the HP-Mitarbeiter , the corporation 's research laboratories in Palo Alto visited; , where he was " the first Desktop-Computer , of the ever produced . " 
He was as big as a suitcase , had a small screen with Braunscher tunnel and I admitted in him . 
I would take the HP upwards as a teenager , and are committed to this machine and programmes for they write . 
How innovation improved: 
Several times in the interview , jobs , how do we invent spontaneously new products . 
Some boards early in his career , when he einbaute , he was asked by a customers , the whole computers to assemble them . 
He was working with a payment period of only 30 days and both had to rethink the processes and the extradition of the earth-orbiting equipment . 
Later in Apple is he is reminiscent of the problems , which he had in the development of a mouse: 
" I remember quick-dispersing arguments ... you cried to me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] and I was on , went out and found a manufacturer . " 
Ninety days later we had a mouse , we have to build for $ 15 , which was incredibly credible . 
On large companies that continue: 
Long before he Apple lead , saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants with their vision in founder and lost control of their shares . 
" We say , you are working with IBM , Xerox , make you a better room or printer , so what ? " 
They have the equities--were monopoly , is not the company more successful . 
Sales and marketing such people make it successful , so [ there are ] , which ultimately lead the company and the product , with which people are being pushed out of the decision-making process . 
The product genius that has led to this monopoly , will of the people who have no concept of good products versus bad products , stamping-out - craft-type art . 
This happened in Xerox ... 
Xerox would have the whole computer industry . 
It could have been ten times greater , could have been the Microsoft of the 1990 s ... 
They have caught the defeat by the victory . 
On innovation as art form: 
" It is a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product ... when we have these great idea , changing it developed and is growing . " 
We are learning a lot about his legalisms . 
It must be votes , certain things that you can 't do , but electrons , glass , machines; factories . 
We must mark 5000 things , these concepts , and bring it all together ... 
Ultimately it is tantamount to the taste , it comes down to is that an attempt is being made with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to bring these matters to the together , what you do . 
Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal . 
We are always shamelessly stealing in the great ideas . 
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world . 
It would not have been in the computer business , they would create fantastic things in other areas . 
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health legislation , as a court case over-accepting 
On the day of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political part of the question as to whether it will hear a challenge to the health legislation by President Obama , two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , part of a dinner , which was of the firm gesponsort that will take the case to court . 
The incident took place last Thursday , and met all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration . 
One of the cases was a complaint , the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care , which were decided last year by Congress , a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the US the catchphrase . 
The judges agreed to the hearing in March and is expecting a 5 1 / 2 -hour basis for discussion , which probably the result will probably increase the presidential campaign of 2012 , at the time , which will give the court decision , will be in full swing . 
The lawyer who will argue in court , and that is to overturn the law , will probably be Paul Clement , once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush . 
Clements Office; , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies , which supported the annual dinner of the Federal society , an ancient group , which the defence non-socialist legal principles . 
Another company , which represents the dinner has sponsored , Jones Day , one of the business , the National Federation of Independent Business , the challenge the law . 
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc . , which is involved in the outcome of the process . 
The dinner was a few hours after the court deliberated on the case , in a Washington hotel . 
Service , among other things , Mitch McConnell , the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform 
The guests of the dinners ? Scalia and Thomas . 
This is nothing new: the two judges visit events organised by the Federal society for years . 
And it is not against moral rules . 
In fact , to judge by the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts . 
They were , they would probably fall within principle 4 c of the code , which states: " A judge can participate in the near fundraising law and other organisations , with the judge not a spokesperson , Khadaffi or according to programme must not be a guest of such events . " 
Nevertheless , the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case with the related firms , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this , in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten . 
" This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code of the complaints of some judges lie , the court is to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said Bob Edgar , president of the common cause-célèbre , a civil rights movement in the United States . 
" The judges , and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending procedure on court . " 
Their presence and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable . 
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that are off the agenda , such as the Federal society; mix . 
And the Thomas ' wife Ginni is a known conservative activist . 
However , the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan , who have a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas . 
Kagan was General prosecutor under the Obama administration , as the first legal challenges in the first instance in court . 
Their critics , Kagan , withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of bias , since it is very committed to the defence of the law , in order to be impartial . 
Kagan is not about to do so . 
Boeing has a record of $ 18 trillion in country 
Airline Emirates ordered two standard 50 Boeing 777 planes with an option of a further 20 aircraft . 
Also sold six Boeing Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air , a business in the value of more than $ 1 trillion . 
It really is a rare news that a company a contract on 50 of its products . 
But it is a big business , if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and lists the price for this 50 aircraft , with a record amount of $ 18 trillion . 
Equally unusual is the mandator of Boeing: the Middle East , a growing gold mine future orders . 
Need $ 2.520 aircraft worth $ 450 trillion in a forecast , which was published on Monday , the Chicago company , estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the next 20 years . 
Boeing announced at the weekend its greatest task of all time for commercial aircraft , measured by the value of the order:50 two-track Boeing 777 jets . 
The hammer , came from the airline Emirates Dubai . 
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show , an option on the purchase of 20 aircraft , which lists the price to $ 26 trillion increase . 
, the so-called on Monday ordered the Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner , the vastly improved the consumption and passenger comfort . 
Lists the price for six of these aircraft is more than $ 1 trillion . 
" It is absolutely positive for Boeing , " said " Dihora , stock market expert of Morning Star . 
" The quality of these particular customers is very high . " 
Many airlines of the Middle East in the possession of the oil-producing countries . 
So not only do they have the money to pay for the airplanes; . It; it is an increase in oil prices , which normally is detrimental to the airlines , because this is one of their biggest cost items and not so bad , because the country deserves a higher oil price . 
This is important , because they are less than other airlines to cancel or postpone plane orders , when oil prices rise , Dihora said . 
" They have a natural protection , " he said . 
The appointment of Emirates confirmed helps Boeing 's leadership position in the market for large aircraft and to keep the Airbus-Konkurrenten SAS in check , which attacks the supremacy of the A350 . 
Boeing 's victory at the air show , four months after Airbus has announced that it would delay the introduction of the biggest A350 , which competes directly with the 777-300 ER . 
We postponed the introduction , in order to gain more confidence that the customers a higher install and reach; had demanded . 
The Boeing-Aktien rose 1,5% to $ 67,94 . 
Sister of the Mexican President , seemingly loses election in Michoacan 
Luisa Maria Calderon said , have supported the drug traffickers anti-globalists Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor . 
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections . They claimed on Monday , drug traffickers have influenced the race in favor of their opponents . 
According to preliminary results , Fausto Vallejo of the Interinstitutional Party of the Revolution , the PRI , won the race for the governorships in the western state . 
" The intervention of the organised crime throughout the electoral processes and particularly yesterday is alarming , not only for Michoacan , but for the whole country , " said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday . 
" They are our candidate , our staff in the polls ... you have occupied polling booths , road blockades ... and people , [ for the PRI ] to vote . " 
The PRI governed seven decades , in Mexico , until they lost the presidency in 2000 . 
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts . 
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July . 
Vallejo seems to have Claderon only just beaten , before election day still had led in the polls . 
Calderon , a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother , refused , Vallejo recognised as winner . 
Silvano Aureoles PRD , the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party , which is currently still President-in-Office Gouverner , came to place three , a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election . 
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results . 
Vallejo , a former mayor of the capital of Morelia , denies links to drug traffickers and the other candidates to accept the results . 
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels , which specializes in marijuana , heroin and amphetamines . 
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has Michoacan chosen , in December 2006 to launch a military 's offensive against drug traffickers . 
The violence is still on . 
A PAN-Bürgermeister a week before the election was killed during an election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates are withdrawn from anxiety in the local elections . 
The PRI strengthens a victory for the party , no matter how vicious the elections in Michoacan also appear . 
Is the man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race likely , Enrique Pena Nieto , congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: " I think that this victory courageously look to next year ' . 
ADB is Asia to aid in the rescue of the eurozone 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Development Bank , India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis , in order to prevent a long-term downward trend , which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia . 
Rajat Nag , managing director of the ADB , based in Manila , said that the two fastest growing economies in the world " everything in your power " need to do to the recovery of the currency bloc either by the International Monetary Fund or to speed up through direct mutual agreements . 
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil , Russia , India , China), the " dispassionately " look at the difficulties in Europe , and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a collapse of the global economy . 
" We are all in the same boat . " 
" Everyone is so helpful , can help the Europe from this crisis , " he said of the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai . 
" Asia may be protected to some extent , but it is not immune . " 
" So if China and India can help , then by all means . " 
European Monetary Union , in recent months in a severe debt crisis . 
Over the last few days , Italy 's borrowing costs dangerous and the Prime Minister of both Italy and Greece are resigned . 
Could the mounting debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies need to get together , in order to support the eurozone . 
Mr Nag said that any support of Asia is channelled through the IMF , but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU-Rettungsfonds , the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners in Asia greater bargaining power offer . 
Anand Sharma , the Indian Trade Minister , said that " India is going to do everything in its power " to help the eurozone , now that the economy is suffering from the falling exports and drying up foreign capital flows . 
" Nobody wants that the euro zone still unstable and turbulent , " he said . 
" We are facing great challenges and we must maintain a high growth level . " 
" It is not an option , it is a mission , because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women . " 
Others argue that emerging economies such as India , no reason to help the rich Europeans , when they are themselves facing huge economic challenges . 
Sheshabalaya Varshney , a professor at the American Brown University , said that it would be politically very difficult , the 1,2 billion people in India to sell aid to Europe , of which more than 800 million of $ 2 or less are live on the day . 
" At some point they will find that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and spend holidays on the beach and then you have a problem , " he said . 
Lee Howell , administrative director of the World Economic Forum , asked similar , why should be used India 's reserves to Greece in the numerous and to keep well paid public sector workers , geleitetet with jobs in under-briefed , losses; multibillion institutions such as the railways . 
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone will have " significant knock-on effects " on the whole of Asia . 
The forecast of the ADB with economic growth at 7,5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011 / is now " the risk of gradation " because of the threat from Europe . 
He said , to vulnerable emerging markets " contingency plans " to prepare themselves for a downward trend and to protect a significant capital to their Wortschaften . 
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence 
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled a Congress on Monday , as he warned that would weaken automatic budget cuts the national security , and he delivered a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon 's to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts . 
The Pentagon carefully already cuts of $ 450 trillion over the course of the next decade , harsh; now but that further cuts $ 600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress can not reach a conclusion in the spending . 
" The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry , " Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain , Arizona , and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina . 
He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement , which will lead to a so-called seizure , would lead to 23 general cuts and an end of many new projects . 
" Such a high reduction , carried out on such indiscriminate way , would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unviable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other urbanization--is seriously harm , " Panetta wrote to the senators . 
" We would also be forced to get rid of a lot of our civilian staff involuntarily to and , since the reduction would be implemented so quickly , we would almost certainly civilians; furlough , in order to be able to achieve the objective . " 
" These changes would destroy the faith of those who our military maintained and damage our alert seriously . " 
The cuts were ultimately take the combat forces , " Panetta said . 
" Are not affected during the war , in the fight against terrorism by the seizure , would influence the serious interference in the budget of the war effort , " Panetta warned . 
" Staff attitudes were being cut , leading to delays in the attitudes and the attitude , who support the war , would lead . " 
" The salaries of staff would be cut to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted . " 
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence . 
" The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would take a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world . " 
" We are strongly against this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon , when they Panettas letter . 
" This is a result that we cannot live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us . " 
" The confiscation is a threat to national security interests of the United let us create and their commitment should not be allowed . " 
Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon of cuts , remains to be seen . 
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken the possible cuts , although he could have many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House , before he came to the top of the Pentagon 's , and that he is serious decisions . 
At a press conference in the last week , the defence minister a gloomy picture , which could face - a military with skin , but without nuclear . 
" It is a ship without sailors . " 
" It is a brigade without ammunition . " 
" It is a squadron without sufficient trained pilots . " 
" It is a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission , " Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon . 
" It is an armed force , there is a lack of morality and alert and it is not in the position , with potential opponents . " 
" It will be a really angry . " 
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led to Panetta new details , such as reductions " self-creating significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis , conflicts and disasters , serious restrictions on our global nature; and intervention capability , which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations . " 
And Panetta said that could be some of the biggest defence projects of the victims , including those that have been tested and are already in the early planning stage . 
To this list also includes the fight , F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new bombs , the next generation of ballistic submarines , the new Ship our , and the new ground vehicle , the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee . 
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35 , this would be in the next 10 years to save $ 80 trillion , but the supporters say , that it is an important next step to armaments; , so that can be possible dangers posed by China and other opponents carefully; . 
As a lie exposed 
A look at the current headlines , as serious and widespread deception and mensonge in everyday life . 
Of the Republican presidential candidate , Herman Cain , is to be the accusations of sexual harassment by several women Mr . Both sides accuse each other of lying . 
The leadership of Penn State is accused of 's , as has been the supposedly reports , which has used a retired football coach boys sexually . 
In the last week has been mitangehört on an open microphone , as claimed the French President Nicolas Sarkozy the American President Barack Obama , the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar . 
Lies destroy careers and shake countries . 
The New York members of Congress and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner , fools , as he expressed renunciations into circulation , which were refuted; very quickly by indisputable evidence . 
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the struggle-campaigns funding , which is linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair . 
And then , of course , no one who has seen the media circus , which President Bill Clinton , as he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky . 
Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread . 
There have been incidents in which teachers have set their students the answers , so that they were cast itself in their performance on tests . 
Mentors , who teach the contrary should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay; . 
How much deception we see ? 
We as studies show , lie between 10 and 200 times every day . 
Many of these lies are valid but as lies . 
One other study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting . 
To learn lies to Milosevic--and or " lies " is a , which is important for all people , both personal and professional reasons . 
Far from a parlor game such as host Aden , where it is the goal , " property you ! " RethinkHIV , is the Enttarnen a deception a serious know , based on scientific data that has been collected over the past six decades to prestigious universities that had extensive research projects , particularly in the areas of psychology and physiology . 
The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been revealed . 
Lies a balance--or in the eyes . 
They even , fumbling , reddening and zappeln not always . 
This however , it is not that difficult to identify and are these liars . 
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth , about the structure of the claim that the fine of emotion-related facial expressions , sex-texting on issue and timing . 
I have spent several years , the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of drug-dealers . And it is clear that this is a Enttarnen deception a modern ability , which is easy to learn and helps us in the right in our complex world , especially if the withdrawal or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities . 
Good liars are very good , other people to know their interests and their own emotions to dominate , and they feel intuitively , how they are perceived by others . 
Thanks to the research , we know the extrovertierte people lie more than introvertierte people that men more ' itself , " lies for than women , whose lies more ' other ' - usually they want to protect the feelings - that married people their partner lying less often than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell , are often " big lies "). 
We also know that , if a person as a culprit was revealed , others feel less guilty , this person to have lied . 
As you can see , whether someone is lying ? 
First , you see the normal behaviour this person . 
This is called ' Baselining ' , the position . 
It is a reference-point later on the assessment of changes before . 
You watch the attitude , the laughter , the Stimmqualität their attempt . 
They should know better , when someone usually constantly with the foot behind , so that they do not unfairly , if he during a meetings with the foot behind . 
Then you pay attention to accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviors . 
If you look at these accumulations as bells , the strident , not as proof of a exposing . 
People who deceive , congealing , perhaps , if they try to remember their history and perhaps have their feet in the door or they are in the direction out-come , change their position in a significant way or show a " relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch , this deep , " entspannende of and the change in the position that if all the hard questions are over . 
One-centre signal often wrongly , that a Einstellungsgespräch is over , only to this détente after the Einstellungsgespräch . 
Also respect you on the language you subject . 
Only by Scott Peterson is famous , as he used the past tense , as he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her . 
Deceptive people can also use a sporadic language: " I had no sexual relationship with this woman ... Miss Lewinsky affairs " or if a vexed question repeatedly in its entirety . 
The most frequent verbal signs are subtly . 
Some people use " qualifying language , " if they answer a vexed question: " Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know is ... in good faith and conscience . " 
This will be the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual , which often set the alarm bells ringing . 
There is no magic to the Enttarnen of lies , but we can learn skills , thanks to which a exposing is possible . 
Thanks to these skills anyone can become a victim of defrauders less often , both in the private and professional life . 
Controversial plan an oil pipeline will be delayed after exposure to US-Genehmigung revised 
To delay a few days , after the Obama administration has been threatened , the approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico , which is the trade unions , and at the same time environmentalists--adopted sizeable--and , is that the pipeline IP5 companies committed to the project to plan so that we can return to normal . 
Transcanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills will reroute in Nebraska . 
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the building of Nebraska . 
Alex said Pourbax of TransCanada , that the company remains confident that the pipeline will be approved , albeit with a different course . 
This came after an announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week , after the pre-Maastricht one would postpone a decision on a Bundeszulassung for the project , until the new possible as-you is reviewed , the territory of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer , a great Unterwasserversorgung , ' . 
" This is a real step forward , " said the Republicans Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska , to Fox News . 
The new environmental review , which has ordered the State Department , may delay a decision until 2013 , after the elections in the coming year , although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision . 
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a matter for the Foreign Office and said to his support . 
Was the 1700 -Meilen-Pipeline Canada with the Gulf of Mexico . 
It would pump 700.000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas . 
This is where the pipeline across six states . 
Environmentalists--adopted hate it , but labor markets love it , because they value that the pipeline will create 20.000 jobs . 
But the Nebraskas legislators who are against the plan , weighing up the laws , a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer , a main source of drinking water and irrigation to force . 
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment , but the source of energy management , says that the Hauptprüfer the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process , which is focused on two issues . 
One is whether a lobbyist , has been stopped by TransCanada , Paul Elliott , who was 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton , is in a conflict of interest . 
The other is , whether a company that has been asked to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice , since it deals with TransCanada .

She was angry and began to shout - they used the F-Wort and the A-Wort and was very loud ... 
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to get rid of water from the bottle on me . 
She said , Genevieve would become hysterical . 
" I said to her: " You see , what you did with my daughter , " said the mother of the child . 
Labelle , to the mother , who was still Genevieve on the arm , and was held back by their support and will be taken to a waiting car , said Rose Anna Monk . 
The baby cried so much , that it had to be handed over , she said . 
Later asked the family LaBelle in writing for an apology , but received no reply . 
Labelles lawyer and representatives did not reply to phone calls , which has been asked for an opinion . 
The complaint is not closer to a certain damages , but the family 's lawyer , Sam Davis , said that he is not a fee in the plan and the family , the money they get , will give the children cancer; aid . 
" We want that Patti LaBelle takes responsibility for their behaviour , " said Davis . 
" This sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable , particularly if it is shown towards a kindergarten teacher , a 18 months old baby in the arm . " 
Climatic events remaining the economy 
In the first year , in the Mario Lopez Valdez to the government is , in Sinaloa the unemployment and the black economy , while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated . 
2011 will be remembered in the history Sinaloas . It is the first year , to the Mario López Valdez , who described himself as the initiator of the change and high hopes on the economic growth in the government , however , as a result of the climatic events can be no question of growth , but on the contrary deteriorated the most important economic indicators . 
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions in agriculture , but in addition , the growth of the state 's economy close borders and in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity caused by 3,6 prosecutions; This is mainly on the historic reduction of agricultural development by 31,16 percent , the help on the other sectors .

" The number of people the country in search of work abroad , especially in the United States , left , has fallen , which is due to the problems and on the other hand , because it is too difficult to find work . These people remain here and work here , and high unemployment , " he says . 
Undeclared work 
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious , taking into account the high proportion of the work , which comprises in accordance with INEGI 60,38 per cent of the country , the workers are employed , without going into the coffers of the social security fund .

The Supreme Court SCJN (Mexico), the Constitution; complaints that have been submitted by the Senate and the House against the presidential decree , must be brought forward and in the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 , due to a lack of eight votes that are necessary to challenge the laws . 
A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Supreme Court , Juan Silva Meza , was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón was exceeding its powers not when he decree-law with the details of the switching to the terrestrial digital TV . 
With this decision , the constitutional struggle launched by the Senate was rejected for lack of a qualified majority of eight votes , so that the court could determine the constitutionality or the Nicht-Verfassungsmäßigkeit . So the law remains in force . 
In the project for the complaint , which was drawn up by the President-in-Office Olga Sánchez Cordero , proposed to explain the decree-law for unconstitutional , as for the radio and television in question , the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible , and would be contrary to the decree-law the hierarchical principles and laws to keep . 
Voted in favour of the project only Zaldivar , Jorge Mario Pardo , Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself . 
With this argument , a both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies Constitution; complaints against the decree-law . After the adoption of the complaints , not the Gastinger Sánchez Cordero the decree-law more and all activities on the establishment of the digital transmission . 
The Council of Ministers , also rejected the complaint of the Chamber of Deputies , failing in the debate on the project , was responsible for the also the Minister Sánchez Cordero , . 
In his speech , the Prime Minister , do not agree with the arguments of the project to be , in the sense that the Länderregierung not with general rules is to take the measures that the public administration , should regulate . 
" I do not believe that , if we do that , the independence of the regulator would be disrupted . " They reminded us that the planning strategic policies , such as , for example , of the telecommunications sector , from constitutional law , the central state government is responsible , because this is the state affairs . 
The replacement of the analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world , and it is a better use of the radio spectrum electrical , an increased quality of signal and more channels . 
Pushing the changeover , she said , was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age , which is a decision in the public interest , which not only technical aspects , " because they include economic , social , political and security aspects . " 
These matters , they said , " the behaviour of the entire system , in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state they included a group of characteristics , which the Constitution in the hands of the central state government lege . " 
She called to mind that many countries around the world the digital reconvert already carried out , and on the government , although they have a highly specialized institutions . 
We could not conclude that the government intervene with the launching of the contested legislative decree in the powers of the Congress , because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected , " she said .

The Commissioner-delegate Prime Minister Mario Monti , will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this the new government which of the crisis , which has led Italy to the brink of economic Zusammenbruchs to provide . 
A communication from the palace announced that the on Sunday appointed Monti; on Wednesday would meet with the president , Giorgio Napolitano , to confirm the formation of the government . 
It is expected that he will present a majority from technocrats cabinet , although it is not yet clear , when the new Prime Minister will assume office . 
Monti said he would present to the President of the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government . 
" I would like to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country , to cope with these difficult times , reaffirm the journalists , " said the former European Commissioner . 
Does not explicitly Monti; confirmed the formation of the government , but it is clear from his comments that the obstacles are overcome . 
The ' framework is now well , " he added . 
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government that is much less time than normal , while Italy is fighting against the political and financial crisis , which has driven the cost of the debt in an intolerable level . 
The new , the former European Commissioner Mario Monti 's government to adopt a tough austerity package , which was requested by the euro politicians , in order to regain the confidence in Italy . 
The pressure to rush to the burden on Monti , accelerated by the volatile market situation , as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years , with 7 per cent interest rates , which is that , in the Greece and Ireland to request the European rescue package . 
Emma Marcegaglia , President of the Italian industry association Confindustria , with the press following a meeting with Monti: " We said we would support this government forces after all . "

The chances of success were Monti by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi , who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis , increased significantly . 
" We believe that is the efforts of the Benewick Monti to bring about good results , " said Angelino Alfano , secretary of the centre-right party . 
The support of the PDL , the largest party in Italy , is essential , because until now have many of their members--in a majority from technocrats existing government , is just the Monti . 
Support from Parliament 
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures . 
Opposition to his efforts or the delaying of the reforms could once again a devastating attack the financial markets . 
The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference , a failure of Monti 's is a disaster , also pressure from .

After recent revival at the end of last week , when it became known that Berlusconi would resign , have as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister , the costs for the Italian government bonds reached critical limits again . 
A rescue Italy with a national debt of $ 1,8 billion , would be too much for the current EU rescue package . 
Monti said that his government had to until the next elections , which is expected to be held in 2013 , despite the predictions that the politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms , instead of bringing forward the elections . 
Monti said , he would pick up politicians in his cabinet , but the big parties insist that should be the only from technicians , a reference to their concerns about the pressure of the financial markets on procedure . 
Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties the inclusion of people from the political life complicated; .

" Is a dream to play in Costa Rica , which is being implemented " 
In the exclusive talks with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl jazz that is prepared for the band to be next Sunday in the national stadium , one of the best concerts . 
More than 20 years , they have been expected , but the band may rest assured that a dream for them , if they play in Costa Rica . 
The assured the Bassist and Mitgründer of the group , Jeff Ament Viva , which was last week by Brazil from a Exklusiv-Interview . 
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate  years of existence , and on Sunday , the 20 th , they make their only stop in Central America . 
On this day , they are in the national stadium after 19.30 p.m. , together with the band The X in Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica . 
They read an extract from the conversation to find the full transcript in the online edition of La Nación . 
For EURES Costa Rica , fans of a dream , if others-plays Pearl jam in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for EURES fans ? 
Is a dream to play in Costa Rica , which is also for us . 
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America and , until now , it has been great . 
I am only once been on holiday to Costa Rica is a beautiful country , that we still have a few days they will stay there . 
It is exciting for us to bring our music there . 
I ask you this , because the fans of the bond completely , and they see the days before the concert given . 
What does it your most enthusiastic fans ? 
Thank you , all these years to be on our side . 
We have taken almost 21 years , until we have arrived in Costa Rica , and I am pleased to have been waiting for so long and we are very sorry to have taken so long , until we got here . 
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year . 
Is this not a little pressure from your visit ? 
Some of the greatest shows that we found in the last 21 years have , in the last two weeks . 
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica . 
Really , we want to play there . 
We love this country , we are like and surf the jungle; enthusiastic . For Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world . 
How did you do Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ? 
Many of our friend site and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo , where the waves are simply unimaginable . 
My friends are always surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua . Along with Mexico , the excellent areas for the surfing . In this way , people who love the surfing , we have heard about it . 
With a view to the tour have offered their giant shows with many songs . 
What you have plans for the event in Costa Rica ? 
Because we have never played there , we are also no borders . 
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs and we want a few songs from the album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire . 
Their repeatedly your repertoire , never; 
Why ? 
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs , can play everyone likes another song , so that the decision , which we will play , is not easy . 
If we have two or three song , which we have long been not played , recorded in the repertoire , we maintain our focus better and they can surprise us , because they are the reasons why , we like this song , otherwise they could be forgotten . 
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe and , therefore , for the audience . 
With this tour celebrating your ways history . 
If it looks back , you find it hard to believe in your success ? 
Yes , totally . 
First of all , I believe that none of us has presented itself to play once in a great rock band , and that more than 20 years , which is like a dream . 
We are also further on this blessing and find it , still able to make music together . 
We can and we are thrilled to produce music . 
We are fortunate to be able to go to the places in the world , which we have always wanted to visit again . 
Things could not be better . 
What it meant for you , to have actively participated in the birth of the way ? 
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of large band . 
We are good with the people of Sound Guards , friends Mudhoney and Alice in Chains . 
It is surprising and very unusual , if a movement from a group of friends . 
Now and then , a bond from a city , but it is unusual , if five or ten groups at the same time from the same city . 
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group . 
Sometimes we still play together . 
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guards on their tour , and we look forward , still friends with them all to be and it is to be part of this that Seattle-Sounds . 
It is also very unusual that a band as your zusammengeblieben is with the same musicians such a long time . 
Yes , four of us play together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us , and that alone is much more time than last for many band . 
First of all , I believe that we are all happy to be still alive , and also we care about each other . 
We are all close friend , why have opened up musical paths to allow everyone the freedom to experiment . 
A familiar with the others and its music , and it could not be better off . 
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy , on the other hand , why their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a . 
How is it a balance ? 
The way in which we are up to , has made it easier for ourselves , to find a balance . 
We are sure , not to be too often on tour , because it is too easy to forget this game with huge numbers of people who love your music , to escheat . 
As long as we keep in mind that the people are because of the music here , it reminds you that you , the music and what it has created , respected , without being too keen to be a famous rock star , which has never interested in us . 
How have you to your other project Mother Love cuts ? 
I believe that we have very good song written and to the beginning , it was great . 
We were a band for three years , until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a record . 
We were disappointed , for so long , and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (TD), with us were the collar; friends when I hear a song or see photos , I think , what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , to laugh together and on music and football and many other issues . 
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him . 
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica . 
Is it true that it knows its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and the band for the opening selected ? 
Yes , the production sent us videos of several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer , which will be exciting . 
Why change the text by Yellow Ledbetter always , if you live others-plays ? 
This is a question for Vedder Ed (Eddie), I have no idea . 
He sings it , and I believe that he is the first thing he chooses . 
By whom President; influenced you as Bassist ? 
Of so many + 
The first to come up with me , Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ... 
There are so many that I could talk about the Bassisten , which I liked , all afternoon . 
How has it Pearl jam , the way to keep alive , even though it is no longer a fad ? 
I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word for . 
If I think about it , I can think of the band , which I have mentioned previously , for example , Mudhoney Sound Guards , nirvana and all the others who were at the same time , if they are still important , I think the great , because it is interesting to hear the music and band as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before . 
Initially was their music dark , now it is positive . 
Why ? 
This is interesting , because I believe that there are a few songs on the new album , which could be something lightly , but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark song , although they also have a good thing in itself . 
To two of the tears when I heard it played as Ed . It is very dark song . 
I believe that if you are older and is something drastic in your life - for example , if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced the your artistic creation and your music and these two songs are the clear for me . 
However , I also believe that we can make a happier person and still dark music .

House , have been held in the major parties , was applied; 
The householders had 11 of the 13 homes in the buildings in the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona). 
The twelve House occupying forces left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance . 
Everything indicates that have found the nightmares of the neighbors; of No 51 on the road Balmes an end . 
Twelve people left the building voluntarily yesterday afternoon that it illegally occupied and in which they had organised huge festivals , which had driven the neighbourhood to despair . The evacuation was on judicial order without any police intervention . 
After the evacuation was replaced the door , in order to avoid a similar situation . 
" From now on will be the access controls , " confirmed the skeleton .

Their winner , Maria Pantinat said Europe Press , that would be dropped their business since the beginning of the House; occupation in 80 . 
The owner of the disco pointed out that the House occupying their unfair competition , because they sold the drinks to three euros , while the cost of the disco EUR 10 . 
Was also the owner of the Freizeitlokals from its neighbours because of disorder reported , while they tell us that the noise non-industry-funded the visitors of the disco stemming , but by the Hausbesetzern and in particular of the guests of the festivities , which were organised there , and according to the disgruntled neighbors have been in the past few weeks more and more and more .

Park or mountain ? 
The architects agree apart from the squabbling over the fees with the tender . 
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona . 
In the mid 1980 s , the peak of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola . 
The brochure , den Berg described as a massive city park in Barcelona . 
He was even in figures; compared with the Central Park in New York . 
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987 , the park in the eyes of many of the ceiling of Barcelona , because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction , but upwards (mountains) and (Sea). 
The classification Collserolas as park plays with this idea . 
As a model was no longer the Central Park , but yellowbox Stone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs . 
So far it was , as the city in September a huge Tendering , consisting of 16 competitions , spend for further access to Collserola gates . 
Undoubtedly , a gateway to the concept of a parks . 
Either this is the case , or somebody has to put doors in the country . 
The question arises of themselves: Collserola , park or mountain ? 
The announcement is not only from organizational power , but also in a reflection on the city about the discussion of all architects from Barcelona . 
It is almost a rekurrentes issue to the two members of the old eingesessenen caste , who meet in the lift , can use . 
Think about it , and this fact offers the stuff of one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona , and some university professors who have applied to the project . 
Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate . 
For Roldán " it is necessary , " after the attack on the coast on the " front " in the mountains , the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , on the green apples , has been held . 
" It should be based on the principle that mainly largest Park is the beach . 
Among other things , because it is easily accessible . 
Collserola is more complex , " is the architect , for whom the title " doors of Collserola " an " impressive " is: we must not " as access to a park , but as a limit of areas where we need to act . " 
Modol , as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a " intellectual challenge " that " some risks ' . 
Risks from the " uncertainty , which brings with it the creation of a public space today " from the 1980 s , after the experience in the field of the forum had their ' swan song ' . 
The first fear is the limit to what can be developed . 
" Contain something always means to determine the next step " to go beyond that . 
" We need to think about new urban planning instruments , because the current [ in response to the bluebrint General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster . " 
Modol , which is close to the issue , simplified , the side of Collserola , in the sense of Valle Ana , " can be understood as a Park , not the direction in Barcelona ' , and for Judenstaatrein involved . 
Modol , pointed out that there is already a study by the patronage-based de Collserola , which should not " fall on deaf ears , " even though he was grateful to the City Council that it has given his body the way , " " from the first to participate in this project . 
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief , which allows the architects , to participate in the debate , although its " doubt " to say whether this technical profile the Multi-disciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing , " he says), ' We architects should only be a tool . " 
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: ' 16 competitions were advertised in the sample , " he says , " on the Gebirge-Meer axis . But there is no Längsschnittperspektive , the area in its entirety . " 
This has led at least in his case that he is participating in the 16 competitions . 
Otherwise would clash the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors . 
His opinion , the city should absolutely guarantee that the swath directly on the whole length of the Ronda de Dalt is so that a soft transition between city and belt .

After the attack on the casino Royal Gil , Sergio García , the owner of the casino Red , a series of photos and videos on which is Manuel Jonás , which allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money , so that the City Council approved the secret operation of the competition . 
After the criminal complaint , the public prosecutor in criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistischen mayor , who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days . 
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales he was taken to the Casa de Barrio Antiguo Arraigo 1 in the capital . 
In this place he was 49 days after a second arrest warrant , the officials of the Ministerio Público had rejected the offences of corruption and organised crime . 
On 19 October , he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta because he is supposedly the owner of the casino Red with one and a half million pesos had bribed . , however , it was just a few hours in the Mittelsicherheitstrakt , since death threats against him . 
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of urban prison in San Nicolás de los Garza . 
On 25 October was the secretary of the Second court of the southern , Jorge Yánez , sent to a prison regulation , said that high after the almost two months of investigations sufficient evidence to speak Jonás guilty for the payment of 1,5 million pesos to the representatives of the competition , in order to open this in return . 
This Monday , the host of Red , Víctor Aldo José Luis García Gómez a judge Pecina , the brother of the mayor to cancel the punishment , which is why he will be released in the next few hours . 
During the court hearing asked Ramiro Arias , the officials of the court allocated Ministerio Público , García Gómez , whether have repaired the damage and what was the owner of the House , his forgiveness . The lawyer has the name , however . 
In accordance with the 197 / 2011 Jonás Larrazábal free action; also can no appeals against the process , will also be no compensation for . 
After the hearing of the trustees of the Wetthauses was at around 15.50 p.m. Larrazabal Bretón freed immediately . 
The justice secretary , Jorge Yánez , the urban prison in San Nicolás de los Garza , to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and would be the case . 
He informed him about the judicial Order for the immediate release . 
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident , in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people died . 
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transport - SCT (Secretariat-General for communications and transport in Mexico), that the results of the accident , in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people , point out that the helicopters with all its intact structure directly against the ground , without the pilot an emergency landing could take . 
At a press conference mentioned Dionisio Pérez Jácome , secretary for communications and transport , that would have confirmed the pilot before the start , the weather conditions were suitable for the flight . 
" The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres of contact with trees , and lost the helicopter the rump , seems to indicate that the helicopters had several contacts soil . " 
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff . 
He also said that in the investigations in the area , the machine on the decrepit , was not Hubschrauberteile were found . 
" In the search , no aircraft parts found in other places , the surcharge was the whole structure . 
The helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the passengers . 
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees . 
Now it is a priority , the results as soon as possible , but this could take several months , perhaps even a year . 
, for its part , assured Gilberto López Meyer , Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and services in Mexico), that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit flown and the plane fell to a soft Abhang . 
" This information strengthens the assumption that it was taken at the time of impact to a normal Flugoperation . " 
At a press conference , the head of the SCT , Pérez Jácome , six relevant points which , in the investigation should be taken into account: 
Flight: 
In line with the standards was a flight to the rules of the flight , which means that should have had the team during the flight and on the ground is sufficient . 
Weather conditions: 
The AICM , appropriate weather conditions at the start . Forth--that during the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexiko-Staat went on some deep some clouds . 
Elected routes: 
It is possible that selected the team because of the clouds a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca-Tal . 
Impact of: 
The impact of the latest radar and recording of the helicopter agree . Perhaps there has been before the impact of a loss on the plane , a deviation from the air route . 
Were the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: 
The until now this information indicates that the helicopters from ascending and seitlicher direction aufgeprallt was . 
The pattern of the plane scattered remains suggest that was aufgeprallt the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground . 
No evidence of fire or explosion: 
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident at either fire may suggest explosion . 
The last results point to several Bodenkontakte . 
In the investigations on the ground aircraft spare parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level . Abschüssig and is showing Schrägung of seven to  degrees . 
The photos show the sequence , in which the helicopters is likely to break . 
Some information suggests that could have had the helicopters several ground contacts . 
After a minuziösen search in an area that is beyond the wake at the scene of an accident railroad-bridge , could not be found commutes aircraft spare parts , which the adoption bio-fortified that caring for Flugzeugstruktur against the soil . 
MSS is a research protocol to the finding of the gene for obesity . 
They Social Security Institution Mexico 's , a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people , which is supported by IPN . 
The Mexicano Instituto del Seguro Social - IMSS social security fund (Mexico) announced that a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title " genetics of obesity in childhood and youth " is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity . 
Miguel Cruz López , the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for medical research , focus biochemistry) to the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that one team , consisting of doctors , improve , Ernährungsspezialisten and social workers . 
This team is supported by specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) Politécnico del Instituto Nacional (IPN). 
The population is invited to take part in the study , interested parties can come to sports of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico , where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests with children and young people . 
He stressed that the investigation at the sports Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) started and since 8 October at the sports Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue . 
If that is the target of 500 to 600 inquiry; people , the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south of the main city of) and on the Morelos (in the north of the main city of). 
He said that the aim of the study had knowledge of other factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases . 
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes , it will come to an end , he said that  children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent; and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires . 
You will also raised questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to risk factors that could have diabetes or renal insufficiency , to control . 
He took it from that (measured by the aforementioned Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen weight , size , Taillenumfang), their blood pressure controlled and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel , Triglyceride , Cholesterol , insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity) would be destined . 
Cruz said López , this would take place at the concerns of health staff on the alarming increase in weight of young people . 
" By the health surveys from 1999 and 2006 that have increased in less than six years , the proportion of obese young at 77 per cent and the girls with obesity at 47 percent , and the obesity has increased dramatically , " said the specialist of the IMSS . 
He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the population in Mexico with that of other peoples unterschiede . 
He was that on average , a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65 per cent to 30 per cent of European and indianisch-amerikanischer , to 5 per cent of African origin , which is in the genes , which are associated with diabetes and obesity , ' . 
In general , he said the genetics of obesity emotion-related in the inability of the surplus to us energy (calories) to burn out , so that will be stored in this form of fat . 
The researchers , the direct benefit of the study participants were in a comprehensive study of children , which would , if this were a degree of obesity or obesity . 
It would even the presence Hautfalten dark in the neck and Innenarm (Akanthosis), the point to the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage , investigated . 
All the information would be treated as confidential and informed the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors say the parents all measurements and propose them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases . 
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors , which are responsible for being overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases , lack of exercise , which means lack of movement in everyday life , most of the time of the day in front of the television to and to use means of transport , rather than short ways to to go . 
The high caloric intake , meaning that an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales , bread , pizza , hamburgers , etc .), together with a high fat and protein and genetics , which is to be analysed in this research project . 
Asphalt by the UNAM prevent potholes 
Rafael Herrera , researchers at the School of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM with Polymeren modified Asphalte , in order to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature changes 
Would the signs that are based on the road surface , respected , it would not be necessary to fix almost 200 000 potholes , if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM , and gave warning that if this were to happen and laying the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags , reduced the number of potholes , or even be avoided completely . 
" Bumps " from a technical point of view , in his speech he gave at the International Year of Chemistry , he knows that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing , however , in order to establish a the asphalt similar mix , the greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures . 
Herrera said Nájera that this type Asphalte modified in areas with extremely hot climate , such as in some cities in the north of the country , should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of the holes . 
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon link , which is part of a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other a low - the so-called Malthene . Together; give them the road surface be typical zähelastisches behaviour . 
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C as a liquid , at 120 ° C , it is very liquid , and in 50 ° C , while he is in very low temperatures fragile . 
" That means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the roads is not uniform , but on a day depending on the weather and temperature changes change ' , the engineer . 
The researchers said the FQ , the streets of Mexico City have majority a flexible road surface which , together , from six material; classes , which included the last three asphalt . 
Between the top classes is a abrasion-proof layer of asphalt , from the small , in gebadeten asphalt and then entrenched stones . 
Every single piece this decay , had been bathed in asphalt . 
If the vehicles to travel and produced forces , this class a good forces; distribution in the road surface . 
" If it were modified asphalt , would distribute the forces , even better , " said the chemical engineer . 
" On the Verschleißschicht " , he tells us , " will be a final layer , the so-called Tragschicht , interpreted the from tiny stones , that is , from sand , which has also been in asphalt sweating . 
Because they are class in contact with the car tyres , they need a greater force than the mechanical abrasion-proof class and they must produce friction . 
The this road receives the most forces and distributed , the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is , must be maintained . 
The weather conditions , including humidity and temperature fluctuations , are more important to take into account factors , above all , the water , " he said , " because it affects the behaviour of the abrasion-proof class . 
If the site is a wet , water in the class and is only difficult; back; that caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and as a result , the incidence of stroke . 
If a pothole , " he said , " will make the Titanic-Maru class , while the abrasion-proof class then , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs of proper maintenance programmes . " 
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores national research system (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the presence of the holes , so must the thickness of each class of the surface and in relation to the vehicle , and it must be ensured that is respected in order to prevent frequent blow holes this arrangement . 
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research at this stage , for example , about Asphaltemulsionen , which in other countries are already on the market , and with which the bumps repair clueless.Despite simply and without high temperatures . 
What was the candidate del Valle , to be the new Miss Colombia ? 
Analysis of the factors that insists that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia not . 
El Valle receives his 14 th disproportions title . 
Once again Valle del Cauca empty for the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia . 
This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to be on the winners podium , a silver crown and the bond that they , as a new disproportions Colombia to make . 
With this the night they result in Cartagena , where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar , the 's Department at 14 disproportions title and Melina on the legion of women from Cauca del Valle , who had kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed . Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leïla Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). 
The big question that there are many today is: What was missing ? 
Because the result is the demise of a big favorite , which had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia . Not for nothing that she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor at Jolie of Vogue , title , which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro , and took the crown of Miss Colombia with home . 
The first factor that is seen as crucial for the jury 's decision to appoint them to the first Miss , is that it has the answer to the question " what book you most and why ? ' , which affects their of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria had Leamos , was not convinced . 
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied the author: 
" I read a lot , I think quite to the literature , I believe , it is a kind of ended , ultimately , I believe that the book , for my childhood most era--was , ' the small Prince ' is a very deep book . 
At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement . " It is a book of universal culture that we should read all I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a wonderful book , ' passions ' . 
A response that was , firstly because of the term ' more civilised , ' and , secondly , because they had not declared , in what way each proposed book they had influenced . 
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result , " The universe is wise , it happens , what needs to be done . 
And for all people: read a bit ' The small Prince ' and it is a great book . 
Among other things , it is said that Nováky is the favorite of El Valle . 
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the measures , which are all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to get all the prices had (Gastronomie-Wettbewerb Oster , Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), " made the other candidates jealous , what the Queen stresste , which could therefore not shine on the stage . " 
And the said in her first speech to the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony . 
Although I am sure you in two , it lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico to window-dressing; . 
Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the programme " Como en casa " in the channel RCN , said that the fact that Melina been crowned Miss , " shows that the candidate , wins the most prices during the competition , will not ultimately Queen . " 
Was also Valle at the end of the press from the road - a mistake . 
Is a further hypothesis that could not convince the Valle Jurie on their interest in social work , which is the essence of the National beauty competition . 
There must be a reason that , two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty , they were a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country . 
" Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia . We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social feeling , that she had already worked on projects from participation in the competition , " she said . 
There is speculation that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and fibrosis , which said it in the stomach area , had sinned , but it is inconsistent , because the jury , as a candidate for ' natural beauty , with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work . 
The coach of the queens , Jorge Hernán Orozco , admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better , " but their problem with the fibrosis belly , which was difficult for me to be honest to say , put their marks on the last day . " 
, meanwhile , is the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos that of the woman from defects; Valle del Cauca are the surgical intervention , which they have been . 
" The operations are OK , but Valle did not know how they do it right . 
Their body is never their strong side , and this job; they had to pay . " 
Because of this prize , which assesses the first time by the National beauty contest , emerged after the appearance in a cruel to forecast the in the night should be true , it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize , if they are not allowed to come in tax-neutrality crown . 
Whether this is true or not , the fact is that the inaugural Melina today the rule , not the Queen , but as a Princess , a position that it offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National Colombia; beauty competition in one of the international competitions . 
However , it will be as one of the queens , escaped the despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena the crown was , in the history books . 
It was the work of the doctor , the body of Alfonso Cano identified 
I--a Lophoskopist from Cali went as the man who " Alfonso Cano " identified in history . 
The work of these officials plays a key role . 
On 4 November was a Lophoskopist last of the fraud investigation unit of the prosecutor 's office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the head of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: " Alfonso Cano " by comparison of fingerprints . 
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI , this week Eliazar González services , of a man from Puerto Tejada since 21 years ago in criminal investigations . 
At the beginning of his career González worked in communities of Chocó , where he had to go often five days in the jungle , in order to achieve the place , in which the bodies that were he should identify . 
2000 siedelte Valle on and after the completion of the necessary courses he is on Lophoskopie , that is the investigation into the skin , the friction , that is , the pieces of baggage and Fußflächen exposed . 
In the week of the use of the so-called Alfonso Cano pointed out Eliazar put clothes for at least three days . 
Nothing much awaited him . 
Friday night he flew in helicopters from Palmira after Cauca . 
He knew that he had to identify two bodies , and that there was a suspicion that the of the man , who had led the world 's oldest guerrillas could be , so he should be the Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name). 
When he reached , but with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was , he could not identify him because of his physical appearance , because this was the pictures , which he had seen in the media , not in the slightest . 
He had a beard , was dressed as a pawn of the area , no glasses and was very much thinner . 
But fingerprints don 't lie . 
Armed with a magnifying glass , ink , a Pflanzkelle pockets and a lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the Abdruckblatt . 
He had seen right: it was " Alfonso Cano . " 
Was still the same night this man from Puerto Tejada responsible for the Defence Minister , Juan Carlos Pinzón , to say that it was in fact the leader of the FARC . 
Traces on search 
For a Daktyloskopen of Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against ' Cano ' , very important . 
Many people know our work is not . 
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate , which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime . 
Lophoskopisten not only identify bodies , they also support investigations in murder and robbery , and confirm the identity of the person arrested . 
When they were arrested many criminals wrong before or they have no identity papers . 
We take the fingerprints from them and look them in the database . 
The researchers told us that he had to in a theft a piece of wall from a House grab; , because the thief had it is at this point with his hand aufgestützt , as he is a fully gestopften safe herauszog with jewellery and money . 
' walls are difficult , because their surface for fingerprinting; inappropriate , but in this case we have the imprint of the whole and the criminals , who had participated in several , identify , " he recalled . 
The fingerprints can be relieved or even murder suspects . 
Recently was found surrounded one death of spirits bottles . 
In the investigation that could be a family member who was thought , and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle . 
Although not guaranteed that it is the murderer , but he is with the place where the crime was committed , in context . 
A Daktyloskopist CTI declared that " the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were excluded from the object . " 
If it appears , is used for carrying a Pflanzkelle or a bond . 
Then the prints to Asif sent , that is the criminal database , or to Personenstandamt . 
" The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented , " the expert told the CTI . 
He said , not everything is as it would in the TV series SCI outlined; . 
So as not all the gold is , what is , that is not everything that touches turns , a fingerprint . 
But nevertheless , it can be used , if a comparison . 
The " outraged " challenging the authorities in New York 
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed in tents on the Zuccotti-Platz together . 
A large part came after the evacuation order and changed its location in a nearby park . 
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street in this Tuesday called for the authorities New York , when it with a court order once again tried to enter the Manhatten-Platz , after they were in the early hours of the morning by the place has been removed and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple . 
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed up before the Zuccotti-Platz to which they themselves with a court order , the " outraged " is the new tents at this point , to provide access . Meanwhile , another part of the movement of the evacuation orders and occupied a parking further north in the city , where there were nine arrests . 
" Our idea is that , if the court does not allow us to campen on the place , we are in a different place and the battle with legal means to continue the return to the 's Zuccotti , through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations , " said Mark Bray , a spokesman for the movement " Ocupy Wall Street . " 
Bray said that the response of the " outraged " at the evacuation of their tent camp , which directly by Michael Bloomberg , had been ordered the Mayor of New York , came to court where the judge who Lucy Billings an order the forced evacuation of the place , and the demonstrators , the tents . 
Also occupied the " outraged " a new park , which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entry in the Holland-Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jersey , and is the property of the Trinity Church . 
They could fill the place at least an hour , but after that , the police and arrested some of the demonstrators , although Bray can be no precise figures , he told the news agency Efe that he saw including several journalists with handcuffs . 
Assured the organisation that it had joined hundreds of people at this point , in which a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement were and communicating with the police arrived . 
Now , the Zuccotti-Platz (a site in private property;) closed pending a court hearing , which is still scheduled for this Tuesday , and in which the legality of the evacuation should be analysed that took place in the early hours of the morning . 
Some of the demonstrators , place the photo copies this court order , and that they currency--they , even some police officers who guarded the place , " some small clashes " as a result , as reported Bray , who had indicated that some police have beaten demonstrators . 
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street in place and the use of " laws , which were adopted after the occupation and that the protesters with their tents and other things that they had used before , in the park . " 
Mayor Bloomberg is , in the press clearly , due to this court warrant the re-opening of the place in public and the demonstrators had been lifted , the demonstrators , he has indicated that the Stadtgesetze did not allow them to return to set up tents and Schlafsäcken in this place . 
The mayor defended personally the evacuation of the Zuccotti-Platzes , carried out in the early hours of the morning in the nearly 200 people were arrested , and it was decided on , because the protesters " against the law . " 
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clearing of the square , because this " was turned into a place where , not the people protesting , but to break the law and in some cases , in order to harm other people , " because " some shops have received threats ' worry and the residents ' to their quality of life . " 
" The evacuation in the dawn was loathsome and shows that Bloomberg , in fact , in protecting the interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers , " added the spokesman for the movement , the mayor anschuldigte " to respect the freedom of the press . " 
The leaders of " Occupy Wall Street " informed that they thought , " Great actions " to organise for Thursday , together with local organisations and trade unions , the two months ago , the last protests since 17 September now to remember . 
Pamela Anderson is in the TV-Weihnachtsshow the Virgin Mary 
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will be on 1 December in the TV-Programm ' It 's a Russell Peters deserve ' act 
The Canadian citizen Pamela Anderson was Tim 's assistant in " Home Improvement , " Rettungsschwimmerin in " Baywatch , " rabbit in " Playboy " , the wife of the Rockmusikers Tommy Lee and now will be the actress and model in a Christmas Canadian television programme of the Virgin Mary . 
The private television channel CTV , today announced that Anderson , together with the " crooner " (ball) Aden singer Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on 1 December in the TV-Programm ' It 's a Russell Peters deserve " and will give a special Virgin Mary . 
CTV widespread today images of the television programme , in which Anderson - which also to spread on the Internet of pornographic film itself , which , along with her former husband , the stuff of players ' Mötley Crüe , " Tommy Lee , is - as a young girl Maria with a doll in the womb , which will be Jesus , occurs . 
' My Violent in sending a torpedo of Truth " appear in the scene Peters , a well-known Canadian comedian indigenous origin , the recently as facilitator of Charlie Sheen , worked as a child . 
The Christmas programme of CTV , not only on Anderson and Peters , also on the Canadian singer Bublé , married at the end of March in Buenos Aires Argentina 's model Luisana Lopilato , and which is not this controversy . 
Recently had Bublé during one of his concerts in New York Nordamerikanerin Kim Kardashian described as a " whore " . 
Japan is being reborn after the earthquake 
GDP is growing at 1,5% thanks to the domestic consumption and the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March 
Since the last March , the Japanese economy paralyzed , which are still in the recovery following the devastating earthquake , which in a nuclear crisis einmündete , and the worst catastrophe that Japan is the 2 th World War had witnessed . 
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the material damage to $ 300 000 , a blow , despite the difficult global economy , it seems . 
After three quarters of the case , the details of the gross domestic product from July to September , finally to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% on the year hochgerechnete quota . 
In the second quarter of measured value; in Japan begins the financial year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010 . 
The recovery can be explained in part by the machinery sales for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas . 
Actually increased the company 's investment of 1,1% compared to the fall of 0,9% for investments , which were recorded from January to March , the first decline in after six months of relentless increases . 
, however , is the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from Keynesian aligned yourself , using the crisis to build infrastructure and build new ones . 
Is woken up Japan in particular thanks to the development of the domestic consumption , which accounts for 60% of Japan 's GDP . 
These variable rose by 1% , driven by the increased spending for vehicles , travel and leisure activities . 
The stigma of the Yen 
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market , after the yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the " refuge currencies; " of investors , who are fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A. , a privilege , it is like a tombstone in the accounts of the exporting companies . 
With more currency are the products more expensive abroad , a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology companies . 
Toyota and Sony , for example , led their weak profits from July to September on the listing of the yen . 
While the markets continue to ultraperipheral EU countries under siege , the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda . 
" We must be very careful to the the1930 risks , for example , the deterioration in certain foreign economies , the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , " said yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy , Motohisa Furukawa . 
The prospects are really not very aufheiternd . 
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states in September clearer signs of a slowdown in the economic development would have actually been . 
The indicator , ahead of the turning points of the world economy , brought to light , that would be drawn to the greatest economic potential the brakes . 
Because he fell by four tenths up to 100,4 points compared to 100,8 in August . 
The eurozone is even below the average , which is 100 , having fallen by eight tenths to 99,13 points . 
Athens is again doubt 
Papadimos says that the austerity measures are adopted , but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement 
With the risk premiums in the amount securitarian of the peripheral countries and to define uncertainty early Greece further into the labyrinth that leads to the great European debt crisis . 
The impression that the " consensus " of the new Greek interim government rather than a reaction to the pressure from Brussels is as a real conviction of the political forces , is slowly by the facts . 
While the new Prime Minister , Lukas Papadimos , pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the in his appointment agreed are hundreds days may be too short for their implementation , the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia , Antonis Samaras , the new austerity measures and not his call new elections on the planned date of 19 February , will withdraw . 
" The most important task this government is the implementation of the decisions that were made at the summit on 26 October , " assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate , the tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak . 
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment , to reform the law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives . 
It does not remove Samaras communication the doubts about his attitude: ' We have our commitment to support the transitional government , but to do nothing . " 
The conservative leaders was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF , the body; , of which 8000 million , the Athens urgently needs , entsperren , and he made it clear that there are no commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures would approve . 
But the European Commission , which is irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum , confirmed yesterday , at their request is to not: the economic aid would not signed , if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties ' not a clear written agreement as soon as possible " to sign . 
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , Altafaj Altafaj , said that the inspectors from the troika " very soon " to Athens were returning to discuss with the new government , " which for the payment of the sixth tranche " to the tune of 8000 million euros quot; is needed , " although there is still no final date . 
The Greek knot has for a while . 
Queen Sofía: " these are tools for progress and hope " 
The Queen has stressed the " dominant " position of Spain in relation to these type 
Spain has a dominant position in the role of the world 's Kleinstfinanzierungen " achieved . " 
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the last two decades , the world 's second donors had developed for this means of international cooperation , the " essence " is based on the fact that it is a " instrument for social progress , justice and the hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people . " 
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredits yesterday in Valladolid . It was convinced that there are " no doubts " about the fact that these kind of deals would be " absolutely essential " to the set by the United Nations until 2015 Jahrtausendziele " and in particular the aim , the number of employees , with incomes of less than a dollar a day , leading to live below the poverty line . " " 
Spain " is also working to " to the extension of the beneficiaries network; " until the last corner of the world and it is through this responsibly , " said the Queen Sofia , the hopes that the initiatives and contributions by the summit , which will continue until Thursday , will be , " the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and particularly for women " are guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of these loans . 
" We have seen many successes ' and ' face many challenges . " 
The summit on Microcredits is not only a forum for debate , but also a platform to jump-start " two fundamental objectives . " 
Said the Queen , it will aim to have until the end of the 2015 175 million poor families access to these services and that will be ten million of these households the poverty line . 
The concept of the Microcredits is in Spain and the rest of the world to the Muhammad Yunus ' years ago started way " that the Queen Sofia as an " act of justice and recognition " assessed . 
The father of this financing instrument described it as a " admirable idealists who have committed to the fight against poverty " and whose work they know for 15 years , as was the Queen after Bangladesh to learn about the loans strategy on the ground . 
This experience was followed by a year later , the first world summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 . Quot; have all we have seen a steady development , " said the Queen , whose commitment to this project , yesterday the assessment as " head of families ' in ' and ' advocate of the poor ' . 
Finally ended the Queen Sofia her speech , by the people to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty Musikblock . 
" Ethical imperative ' 
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity ' is an ethical imperative " for the entire democratic state . 
In that sense , they pointed out that it is a mistake , to tie the development assistance in times of economic boom , because it was a " lasting commitment . " 
Falls victim to Jiménez was of the opinion that the Microcredits a " serious and rigorous policy is for the eradication of poverty , " and that the governments of the industrialized countries ' now more than ever , " according to solidarity-conscious criteria needed to work , and not to allow the solidarity of the crisis . 
For Spain are the Microcredits one of the " most forms of development aid . " 
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation , Soraya Rodríguez , applauded " the success " , " marginalised " people , ' which are always closed doors ' to ' hope ' and the mayor of Valladolid , Francisco Javier León de la Riva , saying the session; welcome in a city , the " " opened their doors , contaminated by the spirit of solidarity . 
The CDU is proposing to elect the EU president with the advent of vote 
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday , 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel , Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party , without any real difficulties . 
The future of Europe was not originally intended in the programme , but has prevailed in the autumn , in particular those activists enough to do that , the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax . 
The proposed by the Bureau Presidencies request from the European Commission has approved almost unanimously . 
Less than 1001 delegates voted only nine , ten had abstained from the vote . 
Several minutes of standing ovation , which were due to the Interventionserlässen first Angela Merkel and a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , lieen from the three ec-syria tended to finance ministers no doubt . 
The idea of the Chancellor - as well as the application - slogan: the answer to the crisis is " not less , but more Europe . " 
Not simply because Europe means peace , but also because " nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro . " 
For the Chancellor is " the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe . " 
This could be through the control of the European Union reinforcing altering of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of the budget of the countries in the euro area could be expressed , as well as this , however , in the election of the president of the European Commission on the basis of general vote , " in order to give Europe a face . " 
However , this is certainly one of the proposals for a resolution approved by Congress , which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble . 
Certainly , it is unlikely that the 47 agree quickly to this revolution: Groβ-Britannien is is the thing; hostile , and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion . 
However , the milestone is . 
Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of any country in the Executive Board of the weighting of the individual economies , which would seem a more powerful position of Germany . 
The way the climate within their party safe--by Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl , who has not , however , its Congress at the expense of the " small " or to win in difficulties European countries , which would criticise the arrogant Germany . 
As far as of the request of the importance of the Franco-German friendship " is a paragraph , not Angela Merkel France on the plan . 
At least not directly . 
Because it reminded that was Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle . 
In fact , one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army . 
What represents the fraud in sick; reports ? 
After the family allowances UMP and government now the turnover in attack . 
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday , 15 November in Bordeaux , to go to a family car--something aid and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud and to social economic dependence on the state . 
To accompany this attack , which is based on the desire to make the economy in a tough test , is not on the other hand , a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign , wants to focus the majority of workers ill . 
With the economic objectives: the government seeking to the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick , with workers in the private sector . 
In plain terms , that means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days , so at least 15% of its monthly income . 
A Manahme which , according to the newspaper " Les echoes " threatens to anger , would help , however , to EUR 280 million . 
And the other with a Manahme rather symbolic in nature: give the state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in disease case (so far are there for them , in the Gegensatze on the three Karenztagen in the private sector , no Karenzfrist). 
While these issues in the debate , the majority also anew the issue of fraud , but this time on the associated with Arbeitsabsenz abuse that are targeted . 
' controls will be much more important , and in addition , this rückzuvergüten , if requested , " warned Betrand Xavier on Sunday , 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL . 
As in other cases , the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill , a little unproportioniert . 
This is in fact already been the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations , the most ever since 2002 have borne fruit . 
The French are not more ill more frequently than people elsewhere in Europe . 
But first we dwell in the national figures . 
According to the country , car--something CNAM were paid out in 2006 more than EUR 237 million days buy-offs . 
Gemä of economic research and documentation Institute of health care are the days buy-offs in 2008 with 11,3 billion 5% of health spending . 
Under this amount of 46% on maternity leave and work accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube , expressed the EUR 6,2 billion . 
And therefore 2,5% health expenses . 
In 2010 , given the French to the 17,8 days in 2009 , according to a study by the Alma Consulting group on average only 14,5 sick days . 
Midway , of certain differences covered up: a different , in 2007 Monster.com , website for career development , was published , showed that 75 of the 40 th 000 , French workers said to have taken a single Krankentag . 
Another , this time from the health insurance buoyancy; study makes it clear that were 37% of the sick; reports in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days , 22% between 8 and 14 days , between 15 and 15 days a month , 15% between one and three months and 11% . 
Compared to their European neighbours , the French workers not to incapacity benefit more than elsewhere . 
One in 2010 of two researchers of the French state , Centre for science research (CNRS), the long-term study that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (because of disease or otherwise) oszillierte , in France between 10 and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark , 15 in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands . 
The fraud in sick; reports is a very small proportion of the black economy . 
On the fraud will be achieved only a weak Ausma . 
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sick; reports that exceed 45 days . 
In 2008 , the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1,5 million checks that 13 of the 285.000 of the past , short-term ill , the expressed in 37.050 cases , " unjustified or too long . " 
In the systematically controlled sick; reporting cases of more than 45 days , was one of 1,2 million 11% in " unangepassten or unjustified " cases , which expressed 132.000 . 
Overall , this is 169.000 ' unjustified ' cases on several million workers who have made a very ill . 
Represents a paragraph , the only a weak Ausmaβ against , for example , that of the black economy . 
According to the MPs Dominique tianming , author of a in July , Sachberichts on this issue , this is between 9 and 15 billion eurotaxes earnings per year , more than the total cost of daily allowances , and so much more than the Defraudation in last-mentioned . 
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan 
Greece have a new adjustment programme to its economy . 
This has had on Monday , announced the 14 November the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament in Anfügen the fact that were not his government from the Union granted one hundred days , in order to do the job . 
" In order to continue the efforts to find a strong economy , we need the support of our European partners , as well as a new programme to budget adjustment , " said the head of government in his first public speech in the Eröffung the debate on the confidence of Parliament on Wednesday . 
The implementation of the euro at the summit on 27 October decisions is the " primary task " of the new government , with the participation of the country within the euro zone ' at stake ' , he added . 
Consequently , M. Papademos planned , the general government deficit of the country " for the 9% " of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year , after this -approximately- in 2010 10,6 and in 2009 was 15,7% . 
The new Sparmaβnahmen rejects the rights 
Antonis Samaras , head of the right , had already approved on Monday gave its approval to the Maβnahmen the escape from the debt crisis experiment; , said , however , that his party would not result in an additional Sparmaβnahme erkären prepared . 
" We will not vote in favour of new Maβnahmen , " he said at a from his New Democracy party . 
He had with the requirements of the reduction of the budget deficit and debt , as well as to the fight against the waste , was hostile to any policy , however , the economic recovery . 
Olli Rehn , the Economic and Monetary Affairs on betrauter EU-Kommisar , which had prevented that release IMF and EU the necessary loans over 8 billion without written guarantee of all parties on the support of the Manahmen , Antonio Samaras had replied that his word enough and he would not sign under pressure of flood plains . 
Euthanasia and physician-assisted Freitod must be legalised , a panel of experts 
The Canadians live in denial of death , as stated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada 
The body , said that governments , institutions of the health care , and doctors did on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . 
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death . 
Only 9% of Canadians are a really out to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose . 
This is one of the conclusions of an excellent report by the Royal Society of Canada , were involved in the six experts , the different subject areas , including ethics , justice and medicine--a are linked . 
This body , the Government to amend the penal code so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia , where this election , and for patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision . 
As a prelude to the experts a recent poll by the independent EIU society , which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the Erdballes . 
Although has placed in Canada at the 10 th , the study noted that " has produced the death medical care in Canada a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death . " 
Medical care or not:77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers , tell us the of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts . 
And despite the desire of the overwhelming majority of Canadians , to die at home , so die , however , 68,6% of these in the hospital . 
The whole country is considered the rate with 86% in hospital deaths in Quebec . 
In the sensitive issue on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide are the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government , which has already geäuert , no changes to the law on euthanasia and want to begleitetem suicide , are against . 
But now there is according to the experts , the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected; , whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or drug use , we have no proof that such a non-criminalisation Miβbräuche in their application , so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would entail . 
Quite the reverse you encounter much more cases such breaches in the countries in which are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , as yesterday Jocelyn Downie , a co-signatory of the report , in a teleconference . 
" Euthanasia is illegal in Canada , where they are clearly , practised . " 
" Also physician-assisted suicide is practised in Canada , although clearly here illegally , " says Jocelyn Downie . 
Canadians support the euthanasia 
We have that , according to a -approximately- in 2010 Angus-Reid-Umfrage already carried out 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had , as they are of the opinion that this would allow it to alleviate those at the end of their career , their diseases; . 
And 66% believe that do not have the issue of legalisation of euthanasia , to convey the message that besäe the lives of older or disabled people less value . 
In terms of the people who already have implemented a assisted suicide , the respondents to 41% are of the opinion that this should not be prosecuted . 
As far as maintenance or the resources to patients , the situation is less clear , the authors of the report . 
Similarly this in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis should be close to that in the penal code tunnel; , that the possibility of the funds , for the legal rejection , there have been not as criminal should apply . 
The panel of experts , that should be trained health care professionals in the task to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life , and this without fear of prosecution . 
The body , said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . 
Least , calls on the body where already wide-ranging in the Canadian institutions to health care means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen , at least to consider it , because these little as well as the euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and they relate to the same procedures spawned . 
Reservations other experts 
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts report published by the Royal Society of Canada . 
RA Pierre Deschamps , specialist in health law , has the attitude of the report " experts interests--including as ' extremely ' , because this is the practice of euthanasia in the final stage no borders . 
" This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and more than 18 years to ask another person to be him in his suicide help , " RA Deschamps , who had looked at yesterday a summary of the report . 
RA Deschamps also stresses , the author of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual above all others who are involved in the social upholstery of society . 
But now , he says , there would be " guidelines and obligations in a society . " 
Margaret Somerville , expert on health law , also has a " strong opposition " to the conclusions of the report , which they described as " Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest ' . 
Margaret Somerville , which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , is in particular , the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon .

The United States have the " tightening-up of the consensus; against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime " as a result of decisions made by the Arab League and the European Union begrüβt . 
The international community , the United States , the European Union , Arab League and countries such as Turkey have been given the repression in Syria an ever more fiercely tone , " observed Mark Toner , a spokesman for the state department . 
During this period , 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government is in the region of Dar-es-Salam ' of a death in the south to Syria , the Syrian Observatory for Human OSDH law .

He has , with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks , responded that his assessment after a " dangerous step . " 
Syria " will not give in , " he added in the rhetoric , " the against Syria was forged plot would fail . " 
Following the decision to suspend Syria , the Arab League is now a " protection mechanism for civilians " and wants the posting of 500 Arab human rights organisations , the media and military observers into the country . 
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé was also in favour of the posting of blatantly , civilians against repression of the regime , it is still in its " paranoia " einkapselt , strong to defending .

To this day had sold Tokyo massive yen against the dollar , in order to reduce the Japanese currency value , which is in the process towards a new record since 1945 against the dollar . 
The yen , however , regelmäig , drugs through purchases of investors , the yen as " refuge value " in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe . 
The dollar has fallen on Tuesday below 77 yen , the euro is slipped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen in the vicinity of the levels that had getriggert the last intervention . 
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009 listed the dollar to 120 yen , the euro more than 160 yen . 
This flash of Japanese motto is the exports of the archipelago , since it costs the " Made in Japan " products more expensive and reduced the number of Japanese companies from abroad Einkommenswert , since these this change in the national currency . 
" Japan is struggling after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March , which have devastated the region Tohoku (the northeast), for its reconstruction , " said M. Noda , the fears that this rise of the yen could kill the weak recovery in germs; . 
The third world economic power , with the growth in the third quarter of -1,5 compared to the previous Quartal- for the first time this year thanks to the export increases and consumption of the disaster " plombierten " won budgets once again . 
The Prime Minister does , however , that the rise of the yen not reflecting " the economic foundations of Japan . " 
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi , for its part , has the Bank of Japan (BoJ), on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee , has called on to take all possible Maβnahmen , in order to weaken the yen . 
Hirohide Yamaguchi , deputy governor of the institute , has , however , the BoJ have already Manahmen ' appropriate ' , and he said liess that was to be expected on Wednesday no additional monetary easing . 
At the last meeting at the end of October , the central bank their government bond buying at 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to the 55.000 billion yen (519 billion) to pay off the amounts that they had used for various purchases of securities to flood the market liquidity . 
Euro zone: 
Zinsfüsse skyrocketing , stock markets are back 
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis residuarity undermines the European indices . 
Despite the official opening of the new government in Greece and Italy , and the best growth figures in France and Germany to increase the rates of the weakened Länders consistently . 
The stock markets , which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone , drifting this Tuesday , 15 November , a little more in negative pastures . 
In Paris , the CAC 1,4% at 10 p.m. and fell to 3.064 points . 
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0,4% , London at 0,1% . 
" The new tensions on the returns of government bonds in the euro zone in difficulties continue the global stock markets to produce some of their recent gains . 
" Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection , " said Terry Pratt , institutional brokers at IG Markets , quoted by the news agency Reuters . 
The stock market in Tokyo , which in turn to the new fear of market participants about the capacity in Europe is suffering , that the debt crisis remains closed andauere , with a market downturn of 0,7% . 
" Japan , as well as the rest of the world its eyes on Europe , and the trade is limited to variation corridor , as long as the investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised , " estimates Mitsushige Akino , fund managers in Ichiyoshi investment management . 
This revival of the concern about the future of the eurozone , the single currency , which continues the Baiss on Tuesday . 
The euro is for one and a half months to its lowest level . 
Was the European currency worth 1,3570 dollar which about 10 p.m. , so it was at 0,4% . 
According to the traders has fallen , after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel , who had gathered on Monday in Congress , had granted a request , which includes the possibility of a troubled countries to leave the euro zone , without having to leave the European Union . 
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit . 
Italy and Spain are still at a very worrying level lending spreads . 
This Tuesday morning , the yield on Italian bonds at 10 years 6,85% , the Spanish title established on 6,2% . 
These tensions of the interest rates in the southern countries , but also in France , are still the fears of investors . 
The future Italian leader Mario Monti called for by the markets more time to question the threatened by paralysis due to the debt situation in Italy . 
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had , in turn , confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the starting on 27 October summit of eurozone are " the main task " of his government . 
Spain is in the Visir of the markets , and on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country . 
The Zinsschere (" spread ") between the German and Spanish 10 -Jahres-Obligationen has once again achieved a new all-time high . 
In anticipation of eurozone growth figures 
Statistically , France had a budget by the consumption; supported economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter , ergodynamic a little better than the expected 0,3 . 
Had the statistical Federal Office INSEE the market downturn , however , the figures for the second quarter , revised and a deficit of 0,1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a Stagno-Europe . 
In truth , it is the fourth quarter , the economists concerns me the most . 
Germany had , for its part , for the same period there has been a growth of 0,5% . 
An initial projection of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 p.m. , with the European Commission warns against the risk of a double-dip recession . 
Energy policy: 
Facts should win against dogmas 
There is a matter that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions , so this is certainly the energy policy . 
Availability and cost of electricity matter--to in direct Mae purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company . 
It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen for a reason , to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy . 
The debate will only bear fruit if it the whole economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed explored options . 
The French should their opinion on objective facts , quantum leap rational data . 
Although there are 7 billion people on the planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by making 2050 , must not give up a huge share of the world 's population in a vital element . 
At the same time , it must be the scarcity of fossil resources , in order to be able to continue to produce residuarity electricity , without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , a lost from the environmental debate issue , to forget , to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten . 
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters . 
Therefore blebt Germany continue to isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power . 
This is not the case in Belgium , which is the decision of the need to find a replacement objectives--before replacement source , in Switzerland , which is just to build more nuclear power plants in the last generation . 
Groβbritannien , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India and Brazil , to name just a few states , pursue their projects continue to unenthusiastic; with determination . 
The United States have decided , after Fukushima , its Park another , using the following the nuclear accident Sidmar Three Mile Island once again go into operation . 
Even if the focused on renewable energy sources , German model occasionally as an example , that is , however , the reality the discourse . 
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of the means , one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence in particular of Russia , an increase in the gas and coal plants CO2 emissions . 
The whole of this unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months to come . 
Denmark is a cause for thought the case . 
Denmark is European tables leader in wind energy , from which it takes 30% of its electricity , but the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas , used it with wind energy; because of his CO2-Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average . 
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French budgets by 40% higher electricity bills . 
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key role of the competitiveness and the stability of the industry at national soil , the French electricity companies because of the best in Europe . 
Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy , what the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to liesse illusion . 
Polls showed that the price is , the very broad majority of French people , as well as little is willing to pay , they resistance against the principle of this energy source . 
Let us remind ourselves that our country 's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs . 
Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings them a whole lot of specialised small and medium-sized businesses on the international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs . 
France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power , it would put a Groβteil SMEs to victims , and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced . 
The electricians would make a work on sixty years designed EPR , when is the decline of its producers ? 
In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are no more a as a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity . 
The developed by the company Areva , low-carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy of the complementarity of energy sources . 
This is the highest possible level of security for the nuclear power an absolute imperative . 
In France we have a safety authority , is the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as the construction in Flamanville . 
Their work teams , who have made a name for their professionalism , are the safety position just had . 
The nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents within 50 years . 
Only one , and at Three Mile Island , under normal operating conditions has occurred , and so has he been without consequences for people and the environment . 
At Chernobyl was the tragedy of reactor design and unendschuldbares , human error . 
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters unprecedented scale , which caused the deaths of several thousand people . 
The nuclear industry will learn their lessons , from this accident , as they had done so after the two previous . 
As a result of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants , the EPR a draft , giving him resistance to such phenomena . 
Because it is considered among the Elektrotechnikern as desirable to build a nuclear power station , it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF , liesse by giving them free rein to gut the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development . 
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country , but it would be irresponsible , emotion-generating , dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate , the equally determined economic , social and financial situation of our country . 
Immigration is burden--if or opportunity for the economy ? 
, as France has had a change of Nicolas Sarkozy 's immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police , judicial and administrative bodies of policy on the basis of the figures , reconcilability this policy with the status of a " country of human rights . " 
Recently had the against foreign students of official harassment of the weeks , the Interior Minister had it (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France " no talent , have Masonic-style or waiter from abroad needed; . " 
But this policy was analysed rarely from an economic point of view . 
On this issue , there is a wide consensus between right and left . 
Of right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac , 1976 , had declared that " 900.000 people unemployed , including about 2 million immigrant workers , should be not a problem for a country ' , of Manicheanism side by Michel Rocard , 1990 , France " could not accommodate all the poverty of the world . " 
The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit 
The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left . 
By both camps , the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society . 
The only difference is the extent of the Grozügigkeit , is to be the immigrants to willing . 
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on the banalities , point out , EC-Morocco development would like it , " our migration problems to solve . 
This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , can possibly have an effect on the elections; however , it is economically costly . 
As we consider the economic experts Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Our World Shaped migration and does Define Our Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 S.), is among the specialists; a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth , jobs and wages in the immigration; countries . 
The immigration would limit the growth of damage and the labour market situation . 
The fears of the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that this threat , the local workforce , particularly the less qualified to replace , by exercising pressure on their wages . 
Experience shows , however , that the immigrants in truth complementary are as much as the local wage workers , because they have schwerpunktmäig professions in sectors that are work technically unausgelastet . 
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract the local wage workers , the better the immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which is a result of inadequate training the labour supply . 
Positive wage effect 
Also would have as a surgeon , to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten , does this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation . 
Giovanni Peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled person rise in flood miteinbezogene , long-term increase in wages between 0,6% and 0,9% herbeiführe . 
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the Ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and the economic growth (high proportion naturalized -immigrants under American Nobel laureates; from Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). 
The migrants are also net to the social systems , in European countries , on average , for a total of 1% of the total budget . 
The International Labour Organisation estimates , for example , that a at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue less spending), of the 150.000 euro . 
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the lack of average points " with the teeth . " 
These said teeth , which the immigrants should be , achieved just the opposite effect . 
Europe has invented democracy , it now remains to rethink the European democracy 
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate asset . 
The European continent should remind themselves , who , after its invention in Athens; more than two thousand years ago the entire 20 th century on the tragedies of the First World War , the Totalitarianism , the Holocaustes , of the Gulag , but also in Franco 's Spain , Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece on had to endure . 
Some thought likely that it will be enough to exercise the right to vote , and to scale possible way , in order to see the democracy once and for all of their enemies win . 
We know since Napoleon " the small , " that it was a feature of the state of mind . 
The general election , is the necessary condition of democracy , there is not sufficient condition and can become the ' repression ' , just as good as s--which it the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it . 
No , democracy requires much more: a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation that separation of powers and control , training , education , economic and social community spirit , a jurisdiction . 
The crisis in Europe , in which we find ourselves , is an economic crisis , but it is also very and first and foremost political and European democracy . 
The attitude of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums would have been in this respect , telling character; had twice: once the need for a strong return of the policy , on the other hand , but also those of the troubled sense of their impossibility , their Unangebrachtheit . 
This ambivalence should be considered as outdated . 
The truth is that have shifted the front lines of the democratic struggle today , and that the Republican soldiers , or at least most of them , are no longer in the right direction . 
We have nothing to gain , in order to push for the success of the infra-national referendum , which according to the needs and in or order . 
Does a receive a carte blanche for the European dictator or a leap with their eyes in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the citizens . 
No , we want to Hackebeil , but a collective responsibility , quite rightly , and cross-breeds , an election and democracy , this time at European level . 
There is no crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal - you know , in fact , not more , where the list - as there is only one crisis , and this is hunger; in Europe . 
It is the whole of Europe , which is the dictates of the markets and rating agencies , which is suffering from its impotence and his solidarity . 
It is the whole of Europe , which is humiliated at international level . 
We are concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is the whole of Europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and every one of them connected nations . 
The urgency is to the sovereignty of the leadership of the European project to give back to the hand . 
Because it is located in the set , whether the Europeans to reduce the burden of debt , by the markets and to enable a future through investments . 
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that can be taken without complete democratic Rechtmäigkeit , without us certainly into ruin . 
After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time about , urges today every European economic governance . 
Agree . 
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as it has in mind - to present to the citizens , would be another foolishness and another prison . 
We must take on a new stage European construction . 
In the Republic of France to create , it took the fact to Republicans ' create . " 
The revolution of the interests; alone was not enough . 
This instruction remains valid . 
We must form a better on an economic level integrated Europe . 
This can only be achieved by , you create a politically more democratic Europe , a truly European popular sovereignty . 
We need Europe to create Europe . 
' contact , " smart cards become the common property 
The world is for smart cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in more optimistic attitude their doors . 
The year 2011 , according to EUROSTAT smart with a 11% reduction in global sales of Mikroprozessorchips (EC-Karten , SIM-Karten-Telefon), with more than 6 million units sold . 
The tragendste segment is the contact , technology , enables the payments on public transport or settling of purchases , it is quite simply the card in a read . 
On the one year previously sold 320 million should be sold this year 460 million contact , smart cards worldwide . 
Their market share should increase in 2012 further (580 million units expected) and over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards) represent . 
Europe in terms of contactless payment gaining ground , after the region for a long time Asien-Pazifik hinterhergehinkt is . 
Some 26 million Visa cards are equipped with this functionality , and 75.000 payment terminals accept them . 
In France , the modest beginnings: only 400.000 contact , visa cards have been disseminated . 
The consumer markets but steam . 
Carrefour has therefore issued this year 2,5 million contact , passport master CARDS . 
In order to move to higher speed , it is now essential that the banks to provide their customers with these cards . 
" Two very broad French financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in the future are systematically bank cards with the kontaktlosem chip peppers , " announces Gérard Nébouy , Director-General of Visa Europe France . 
Banks test payment by mobile phone 
However , this is only a first step on the way to the payment of the future: the mobile phone . 
A very small percentage of equipment is so far with the implementation of these transactions , NFC-Technologie (Near Field Communication). 
" They are in default . " 
" But they should at least know next year a real economic development . " 
" We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide , " said Marc Bertin , chairman of the Smart . 
But the banks take initiative . 
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday , the start of a Testlaufes in Caen , of the December until next June . 
The iPhones some 200 customers and staff are to be equipped with a " , contact the unemployed . 
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille . 
And Société Générale was said yesterday to prepare for the market introduction of a bid; that allows its customers to contact payment via mobile phone . 
Terroristenfront understands , from the Sahara to Nigeria 
Paris is about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram . 
The relations between the already long under suspicion of the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm . 
On Sunday had confirmed the Algerian Vize-Auenminister Abdel Kader Messahel that Algiers; now on " is certainty . " 
" The way in which both organisations and the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation , " he told without going into detail . 
Paris seems to make a similar analysis . 
The investigation on the last January kidnap two Frenchmen in Niger have promoted interfaces . 
In a restaurant in Niamey of members of the Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should on successive days at the same time as several their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten . 
French and Nigerian investigators have found in the rubble at the site several phone chips , which were the terrorists . 
Terrorists; axis 
The analysis of the telephone calls , to several interlocutors in Mali , in Niger and Nigeria are stationed . 
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a commissioner; leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri , a city in northern Nigeria , the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who , as the Aqmi and close to the sect applies . 
" This is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we must wait for clearer evidence before we can talk of a operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem . " 
" However , it is conceivable . " 
" We know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support of flood and shows that they are increasingly active , " of the Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo . 
In these last few months are these ' assistance ' has become ever more apparent , just in the speeches and the Operationsmodi of Boko Harem , which is now on the Hinzuziehen of suicide bombers and the use of complex explosives , which bear the same mark as those who have been used by Aqmi . 
The international community to begin with Washington , has since that time so that they will put pressure on Abuja for the problems caused by Boko Haram . 
Indeed , the Nigerian authorities have the group for a long time as a community of Illuminaten , respectively , of no special attention must be paid . 
Faster success 
In 2002 in Maiduguri environment in a mosque , a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf , Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means " Western education is a disgrace " - is the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria . 
Rapidly in the poverty-stricken region has an association of successes . 
They politicized and strict observance of Sharia law , while the connected activists; in the fight against the God-less central government . 
The activists have first churches , bars and authorities . 
2009 , the activists of Boko Haram with their increased attacks against the run particularly active . 
However , the response from Abuja is indifferenziert as usual . 
The army surrounded the city , is counted 800 deaths . 
The Mohammed Yusuf will be killed in prison that was in captivity . 
As a result , the sect is increasingly radical and out of their strongholds in the north . 
Last Christmas doet itself as an attack in Jos , which claimed 80 lives , then to another in Abuja . 
In June preallocated to Boko Haram blamed a Selbstmordattentates , which took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja , the first of its kind . 
In August is the local headquarters of the United Nations top international target . 
The formation of a terrorists; axis in Africa , from Mauritania on Nigeria to Somalia , concerned since all security experts . 
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger , operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya , seems to be Boko Harem a new threat in the centre of the continent . 
Last week hatta Alain Juppé had one Gespräches with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned about Boko Harem and shown their willingness " to tell all the indications . " 
The world gemäβ of Republican presidential candidates 
Mitt Romney , Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China , Iraq , and the support for Israel . 
Can a crisis weakened America a complex world with simple , not to say: stupid ideas ? 
If you are listening to the Republican presidential candidates , the voters could almost get that impression . 
For the last few days , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and their fellow-campaigners thundering statements , and their statements on the Auβenpolitik , traditional republikanischem focus , consistently reported . 
On China , Iran and the Israel; aid - has often in any way - slogans . 
In terms of the appointment of the " Grand Old Party " Mitt Romney in the course before the WTO , the Chinese and the ' currency manipulation ' - to quote leading issue in America , by the migration of entire industries to Asia Äuβerste prickly is - to accuse . 
Stupid , if this is to the introduction of a trade war imply , he said . 
Jon Huntsman , a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auenpolitik , has paid nearly about his schmeichelnden the emotions of the air . 
He had a solid , but constructive talks exchange with Beijing (also the current position Obama 's). 
But Huntsman will not be heard , because he is stuck in the depths of the polls . 
Reagan 's image 
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran , if not the sanctions on the halting of the nuclear programme . 
" If I am elected , I leads Iran ' , had on it . 
" Obama re-elected , will they get the bomb . " 
Auerdem he has promised military aid to Israel and accused Obama of this partner; commitments to guilty . 
The entrepreneur Herman Cain , second most platzierter candidate , for its part , is a shameful acts ignorance . 
Recently called on it to give the Chinese military threat against , as Beijing " trying to develop a nuclear power " - and the fact auer seemed to eight that China is already since 1964 in possession of nuclear weapons . 
The Texas governor Rick Perry , which supports Israel and military action against Iran , äuβert , to be prepared , for its part , the American army against drug cartels in service to take in Mexico . 
Obama 's 2009 re-application of Foltermanahmen to mutmalichen terrorists was also of Cain , Perry and the Kandidation Michele Bachmann . 
It is far from John McCain , the Republican candidate in 2008 , a auβenpolitischen heavyweight . 
In the current presidential opponent , Reagan had also simple ideas and despite all that won the Cold War . 
They call in memory , that Obama is selbstein amateur and water in our wine , with the issue of anti-terrorist . 
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran , the hasty withdrawal of its " boys " from Iraq , his indecision in Libya , which he also the reputation of the weakness . 
This is not , however , quite so freely hostility . 
The population estimates rather the positive outcomes of the National security under Obama , Bin Laden has switched off . 
Since the Iraq are not about military intervention , which lead to paralysis . 
And Obama surprised adequate , he argues , America must be rebuilt economically , in order to give its leadership to life . 
Nord Stream , new gateway to Russian gas in Europe 
The Nord Stream gas pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and connects the Western Europe directly with Russia , has been put into operation . 
It should provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households . 
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and Gloria . 
Over 500 loaded guests , including four Heads of State and Government , have attended last Tuesday in the Baltic Sea coast , Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet Buffett the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany below sea level . 
Mrs Merkel the German Chancellor , the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev , the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have made symbolic way , the tax of Ventils , which promoted the Russian gas to Western Europe . 
With the new gas pipeline to 27,5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas a year by a first pipeline of 1.224 km , linking the region St Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania , supplied to Western Europe . 
A second pipeline , a Gesamtlieferung from 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allows , is to be completed at the end of 2012 . 
And it is already the possibility of the construction of a third pipeline; on themselves route . 
For Gazprom is the timely and accurate point completion of this huge cornerstone as a victory . 
The project was in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested . 
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany , avoiding any train-path course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine) in the country . 
This is why these two countries will lose some of its power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia , by threatening to film the access to European markets . 
Warsaw , most involved in the debate , the Nord Stream pipeline was not be avoided , with a " new deutsch-sowietischen pact " in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to compare to the occupation of Poland in 1939 . 
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuerst . 
Western Europe has the support of this enlargement--despite project won an even greater security of supply . 
But at the expense of enfeeblement European energy , because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europe were beaten . 
Russia has brought it in almost five years , his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich , Western countries , the strong Gasverbrauche and go to the gas out . 
" This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia , it is a new artery , which unites us on organic way , " François Fillon confirmed at the opening of the gas pipeline , by pointing out to what extent are the groen contracts also of political and economic side . 
All this explains the broad smile in Lugmin number Gazprom-Manager on the Gaszuleitung . 
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology . 
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter , which is to protect the Schiffsankern . 
It rests on the sea bed , in about 200 metres deep . 
In the building had to be avoid; from the Second World War previous minefields . 
" Poisons; hundreds mines had to be removed as a precaution or destroyed , " Jens Müller , Nord Stream , spokesman for the society . 
Auerdem had to be taken more Manahmen for the Protection of fauna and flora . 
The management is a long queue of metal , difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme , which is suspended on the entire length of nothing: either through valves , maintenance stations . 
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden , but the project leaders have refrained from Sweden , as were the little eager to a Russian state company on permanent way on their shores up to see . 
" In the event of an accident we film the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute , " Mr Müller clarified . 
In the event of a leak dispersal-to-air which is in the pipeline of gas in the air . 
This case is regarded by the designers , however , only unlikely , as has been estimated the Schweinähte on a consistency of a leak per 100.000 years . 
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will both guaranteed by a robot under water , which is regulated to external surveillance purposes of preventing , as well as a device which is at the heart of the gas pipeline . 
It has the form of a cigar , miβt a metre diameter , will be introduced in the interior of the pipeline and by the gas pressure moved . 
After three full days of transport by the leadership at a speed of 3 metres per second , , the machine in his arrival detailed information on possible deformations such of the metal . 
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years , without being subject to the slightest repair . 
The Gaszirkulation is quite simply by pressure . 
This is 200 cash in the Zutritts- , 100 cash to the exit . 
Five companies have united to achieve this project their forces . 
The leadership , however , remains in the hands of Gazprom , which is 51% of the shares .
