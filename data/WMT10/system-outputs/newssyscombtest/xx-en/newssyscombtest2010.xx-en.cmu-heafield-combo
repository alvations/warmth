Scneelose runways Sorgenn not only The giant mountains residents.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
It is always possible to find free room for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The People go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to cultivate binding.
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas he mentioned the operator of the information portal Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in the New Year's Eve Spindelmühle exactly according to their expectations, should not hesitate more with the appointment.
Those who prefer to save money and that the quality of accommodation in second place, which can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of Špindler offer for the moment that stays a week for the New Year.
I think that they will seek to sell them for a while, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the free rooms will be quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free for all periods of winter.
Now we are most interested in The Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some stays at the last moment, " said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí still can also offer the New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
Sold very well The first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regulate.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow.
The People are waiting to see whether there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the runways overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, " believes Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to fill the rooms in the hotel higher than last year.
We are about five percent better.
For Christmas We have the New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, " reported the director of the best hotel in SGP, Karel Rada.
With 80 percent for The New Year's Eve visits is also the hotel Omnia near the in the period.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel of Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, which we are currently at around 60%.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest in the placements in Giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday, must fall temperatures and if there is rainfall, they should be the snow in the mountains.
But then again rise temperatures, informed Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself as simple.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it showed that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression " as in Iraq ", he has not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement in January 2007 as the name of his own speech: " a new way forward "
Has he himself three years ago, the personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, by the civil war as " irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision ".
The following month, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of the only possible and captains of countryside, was do not speak today in the news about Iraq.
Bush's reputation has not improved, however objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes to repeat the miracle.
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military It again, especially the commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the trench in the White House.
He called for 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
The president has hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, has the promise for a further 5,000, even though He himself.
The most problems throughout the strategy Obama seems to be his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this process within three years. The whole doctrine of Obama raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the society of Iraq is relatively well organised, their leaders to respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change every day.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain just a people proliferate the patriarchal ethnic relations.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the building of a " strong state ', which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and now it is on the fringes of chaos.
Only a romantic soul, to believe that the small soldiers in the war and reality can be sent to " soon return home " will bring a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsibility, because the Taliban will see this as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents, what has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the winner withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, if it is a total failure.

The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the received Milion dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended slave, a fictional US president, and even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and, for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was spent 27 years in prison for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.

The actor said that if he and the world leaders would be in the same area, had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which there is a majority of white players.

The Russian Ministry of Defence has acknowledged that yesterday was tested near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. the missile, " Bulava " which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in Most cases, it was flying or there was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers speak of " Bulava " as " a missile that did not fly. "
A missile that flies, but do not
This 13th test took place at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight that there was new damage to the apparatus.
Presumably the engine broke in the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, " Bulava " was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij U boat, which under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile launched from a boat that is moving and submerged
That is why It is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified fliegendes object on Northern ways the damaged " Bulava. "
The Norwegians have also since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell and affected by the accident was only the third.
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went completely without error, the direction of the Ministry of Defence only six out of thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost 50 per cent full of optimism to the generals and it is claimed that the " Bulava " will fly again without problems and even will take up to ten a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that is why We proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.

The staff also received for the Saturday class of 28 November.
According to The company decided to change the way to motivate their employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can take a free day on 28 December and extend their aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and complaints of trade unionists and last week, the production has the management yesterday afternoon decided to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vank.
The staff of the car factory were forced to work Until last week, practically every day two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions cancel the strike after signing of the agreement.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and trade unionists must take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they are to meet the demands of some and can sign a joint document that they are prepared to lift the strike.

Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved this substance is the fact that it is also the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
In some cases This is more important than the fact that the link is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as well as some drugs already available.
The disease AIDS can be cured until now.
However, It can prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has a series of side effects.
If the replication of the virus were also has the development of so - called resistant viruses; against the medicines are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus in a different way of all drugs used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In The work of the scientists to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of its Molekularmechanismus their attachment to the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three - dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are united by and through a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV, there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and not create mature and infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are united by a short link, which is then systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The evidence of The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients with HIV.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as on the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten, against which the medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are compounds to interesting for research, on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. ODS went to fishermen, The Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is " appalling " and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The statements of ODS were identified by The prime minister as strong judgments.
It is time for the analysis.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of cabinet officials with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party seems more.
According to the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if it wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the ODS and the social Democrats over the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposals by the left, by more than 12 billion kronor.
The House has increased the money for the salaries, the social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of Social democracy, that they subtly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government, that the amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation in case of approval of the proposals, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with the Prime Minister.
He has indicated that he thought to remain in office.
The reason is His disappointment at the Verhandugn of the budget.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, for example those health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers nominated by the ODS are not
This is the subject of the Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries in are top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the battle against the level of deficit in public finances, " it is absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority, which is currently in the House. "
But it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will deal with this, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer afternoon came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would vote in Parliament on Wednesday against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly Democrats to allow the of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, then he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would lack.
As I withdrew To the mandate, I knew that in the following months in particular would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek.

The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník move every two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for the regional rail: 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so - called the railways next year in all four billion kronor the same amount as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regions, next year will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the Treaty was always a year.
The railway praises the system, it is not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD net and Internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For passengers without the customer card will increase the price of ČD net of 450 kroner to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.

The championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will submit a complaint for defamation against three head of the ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today will submit a complaint for libel against three prefects Social Democrats.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions have signed long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three were attacking us and say that we take the cherries, while it only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of the Czech railways, were completed last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnál.
At the same time have the evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
That is why We are preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Consider this complaint by the continuation of the show medial of Mr Jančura, serving as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the name of my region and I call on other hetmánes to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Jancura, manipulated in the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and used false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest several million kroner in the advertisement, which will highlight the damaging step of districts.
He said to Radiožurnál that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions were agreed to give the Czech railways operation of the regional rail links and for the job of about 150 billion kronor, without bidding.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and incompatible with the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we do not, we can lose the licences of buses.
He was presented as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, I am not saying his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January will put an end to the usual habits.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time voluntary.
But now the already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against neumococos.
The drug Institute is already defines the maximum prices of vaccines, which will pay for health insurance.
The experts are also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination
Vaccines for children born in August
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal free.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
Those who began with the vaccine last year or earlier, you have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families left voluntarily to vaccinate their children against.
The parents paid DKK 1600 and more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
They save but the treatment, which would need the children without vaccination.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around $500,000 per year.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the so - called Janota package.
The neumococo is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
At the same time, said that this vaccine duty could be in the future.
From January, it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, For example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts At an international conference, in which our association participated, were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to get at least this.
I believe that this is the path that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against Pneumokokken.
At the moment I do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, say doctors.
The Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledges that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals of vaccinations " in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination, " said Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will vaccinate their babies.
The Vaccination against Pneumokokken is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children which is funded by the health insurance and not the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for the prevention, so that they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors have to buy the vaccine for themselves.
This is a concern of the practical paediatricians, the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, The vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and doctors the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members were, however, that the insurance companies could " take the money from the health insurance. "
The doctors will have to buy the products and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates will to that invest in vaccines 40 000 per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and we
Can the Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time, the Swiss voters for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most pronounced säkularisiertesten societies of Europe - and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the work of the author: " why the French do not like the headscarf " (2006) , an elegant and that has divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a Good anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr Bowen calls " Islamic spaces ".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should A Muslim in a mosque or a town hall (or both) ?
Should be lectured young Muslims on The evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
A Muslim woman can marry a non - Muslim?
Is it permissible for A Muslim, to use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage?
It is These seemingly mundane matters, he says, which are the daily life, rather than the political dramas concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
The Conservatives are suspicious about the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts from, supporters of Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who now have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that the Muslim values and the French secularism could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite who fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He Suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, perceived an adjustment of values ".
Can the Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say " yes, but not yet. "
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can survive elsewhere.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been approached in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
In " on thin ice " (" on thin ice ") Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, which have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a courageous cadete 14 years, fighting only with the end of his, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while following the bodies of their mothers just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still typically a millionth part of the area of the scope of an adult wild. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore was green because of algae that grow in his fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and often to the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in powerful assault rifles, to express their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters in the north of those two nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, " after the ice " (the ice " Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmospheric scientists are still Ozeanografen can explain the speed of change.

Mr Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of supply system within the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water by freezing.
But, starting with the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in ice, all of them are threatened, once the summer ice, which is between 2013 and 2050.

Marines among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves of Arlington
The Obergefreite De ' Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath at the grave of a soldier who had never met.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who were in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, we could be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we had, I would like to see someone do the same for me, so I try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the trip, stopping in various cities along their way to organize the people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non - profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed wreaths across America) , which has extended the event to other states.
This year more than 16,000 placed wreaths on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this is their way to give a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a small way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen older graves dating from the First and second World war and the Vietnam War, because they are not as often as the new graves, the organisers.
The mood was cheerful, while children played and couples were taken by the hand, while the fresh pine branches to the grey of grave stones.
Each crown round was a dark green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 kroner to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others were inclined to see small black and white, information in the wetland for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Marine Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son has paid for it, she said.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor for the US government to mobile and portable computers in the country, said the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular official with the US interests Section in Havana trying to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being " dangerous ".
All the so - called counter - revolutionary activities, including the slight protests and critical writings, risk of arrest.
The anti - government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a " slow " to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday night.
The new American policy stresses that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and to create more space for the opposition, so that the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile Only this year; they are used mainly for text messages, as a 15 - minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, S. Interests representation in Havana.
Berbena said that he could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that, in any other open society would be as mobile free, in Cuba is a crime said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called " new Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators said they were a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah approached the men once were in Pakistan, trying to help them to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani intelligence service, which was informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that the men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the northwest, which become a terrorist haven
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were determined and they were trying to get the proper approval for access to the camps of Al Qaeda, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who confidence.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US intelligence has as top priority try to infiltrate people within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who might be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential to gain access to American objectives and because of their propaganda value.
But senior analyst for the Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment what so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen, demanding " action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded here by the negotiators working in the Bella conference centre of the city kühneres action on climate change.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day in which little happened in the climate talks sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists marched through the city, banners in English there is no planet B " and one in Spanish, saying " the Earth says ' enough '.
Several celebrities have joined the protest, including the Danish model and Helena Christensen, who said that travel to Peru, the country of his mother, her aware of the issues with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening. "
This is part of the reasons why I decided to join the large demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take a fair, ambitious and binding, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way any longer.
The police prevented the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the use of masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are banned during The demonstrations.
According to a witness, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the discussions on the climate, some activists who wore masks and black clothes several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, but then followed by " a few large explosions ".
In the interior of the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was taking a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, " that is something of which I was not aware of. "
He then continued in Mandarin, saying " as the event venue is great, I can hear what is happening outside. "
He found that the march could be harmful or helpful perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, " you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people.
The data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on the performance in mathematics has brought good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district is still far behind the schools in the country, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years, the Atlanta, Chicago and New York
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational progress is the persistent gap between the results of African - American and white, both local and national level.
The average scores of white students in fourth degree of D. C. over the past two years, grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , but their peers African - Americans rose by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African - Americans in the Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he was a statistically significant point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 () , when the first Enpe in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202) .
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates of education in the District have expressed concern that the rising celebrated by the school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) by white students, who are already good elements.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and controversial, said Jeff Smith, director of D. C. Voice, a non - profit group that advocates for equality in education in the District.
I do not move for a span of two or three points and, said the Council member Kwame R. Brown (of the D. C. accumulation) , who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the proof is that secondary schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But the concern is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which dominated the fundamentals of reading earlier in their school career and the significantly behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences in real life, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which by the of the progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to offer the best speeches to students who are below the level of degree, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will provide the extra money and resources for schools with less to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Then the objective could create political impact that work against this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other cities, it is clinging to the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that We build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is in Washington, the traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with Charter schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, which it considers a " starting point " to seek a increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, fell and cligne a moment eyes at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other students in Grade 8 (4) of the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic students.
This is where I will study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of Sciences.
" wow, really? " she said, when the guide spoke of the low ratio of school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visited the children during their three - day voyage of discovery, and now they have fully integrated the message: the question is not whether you go to university.
The question is where.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who have left the high school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands to university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one In five of these " second generation " at the University, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, entered the United States without the high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country.
Those who study high - achieving children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to go to university, especially if the efforts over a longer period.
If you look at low - income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time is not, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour universities Graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement programmes of preparation, starting when students from low incomes are in the middle school and continue until they have completed the high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent of the university, according to the U. S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi oil Ministry agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are having pujado in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only presented an offer lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will be a long time before another offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and the political instability while the American military are withdrawn, probably prevented the American oil companies risk more forcefully in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil in the world, said analysts.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the ministry.
Major U. S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have deepened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, are empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the state, in more contracts than any other companies and with large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be on a par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies to submit proposals made offers which were then compared with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of Al Qaeda in Pakistan
It is believed that a US missile which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations this week, said on Friday, representatives of the counter - terrorism.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U. S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in the lawless tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants were rushed to the site and quickly seized what was left of the " completely destroyed ".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two representatives of the counter - terrorism Americans unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a military planner of Al Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of Afghanistan - Pakistan.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name for some Americans, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non - profit group.
The decline can be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while ruthlessly to informants, said the site.
The UN special envoy in Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end a stormy tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months to other NATO governments to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon moon pass now, so that he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement, According to UN officials.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen who recently addressed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean - Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping missions.
Eide position in Afghanistan has been put to The test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, " have damaged the mission, because there was already a good dose of scepticism in relation to the international interference in the election ".
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that provided to the Afghan mission, saying that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulations of the UN undermine their ability to attract talent.
The rules of the UN are such that I could not recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and must not continue.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be " significant additional sanctions " on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that I regret is that, if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions against the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a package of incentives and punishments " might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons ", because " their people will suffer greatly " sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences " credible " if its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme, and a substantial part of its enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
But Since then, Iran appears to have moved from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had agreed in early October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called " devastating sanctions. "
In a statement in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called " baseless allegations " of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said that willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, " in order to achieve an appropriate solution in the long term. "
Gates, who was to return to Washington late on Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, property rights and the distribution of revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delay in the U. S. plans to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: " We will your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on them, the the mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children " and " a baby means one more tomb. "
Learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population of their city, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more of a child, her response was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
There is nothing for a second, said Wang, 31, a director of human resources with a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed " little emperors ", a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is anticipated that the number of residents aged 60 years and over, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission has said that fertile couples must have babies to help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future ".
Shanghai is about to be " as old - but not so rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A gradual relief
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one - child policy is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and with discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights activists have denounced abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, which unnatural ratio of men to women.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are children, and in 2007, many of their hard - line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government recently even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child, have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent to family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their home and slip leaflets under doors.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
The head of family planning officials say that the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010 only slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning Committee of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally permitted.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one child policy ' as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
Is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a single child because she was: " We were the centre of the family and that everyone around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we do not really want to care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said it more bluntly.
For parents with two careers, middle class, reducing the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle in during the early days of the Chinese capitalism and do not want to have this kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time of his parents, he said.
A mother must abandon at least two years of their social life.
Then there are the problems of space, " we must modify its housing " - and the " if the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery. "
Most of his friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, characterised so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations, a renewed focus on Friday with the publication of a document that provides for ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would give the rich countries to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a range of options for the key issues, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global rise in temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has put together a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what the Secretary - General executive on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as " the big picture. "
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 to 25 to 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years, to help the poorer countries to adapt to the impact of climate change - from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected, the mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions from the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with regard to what the Bush administration two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, stating that the US chief negotiator, lacked " common sense ", was " highly irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China to tackle global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world's major powers are at stake, the fault lines both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more to the rescue of individual economies that to save the planet, with China and the United States on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, said that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, head of the international climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has " political pressure on the political process, " in part because they are now unified and the emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the issues before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High - level officials, such as the Indian environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, fell from their aircraft and rushed into the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to " during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come in and out of the convention centre, gitarrespielende activists hold late - night comedy shows, they make fun of the countries who betrayed and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper rather than by e mail - is a challenge.
The intensity only built: almost all key ministers are now here and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice - president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the Monday
5h13, Monday morning, a whistle the darkness to point start of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high - speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h, when as a bolt from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service linking Britain to an international network of fast trains and reliable and the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, the times of business travel will be and the exchange of plane and car on the national carbon emissions and would reduce the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage the high - speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2) , a company created in January to provide the government a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, According to the Times report on 30 December.
This will provide a detailed road map of the next stage for the high - speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be fleshed out within a radius of 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high - speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is being proposed is a configuration with and in which a high - speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the north - east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
" It seems that this will be the most effective option, " said a member of the railways.
When completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with the little more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains to long and capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on a line in London - Birmingham.
A terminal can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high - speed network.
The railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the scheme should be put in place, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network would have to be built in sections.
The trains had to switch from the high - speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland over the three hours.
This is seen as a key sticking point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgages for 75,000 pounds Orangerie across a conservative on
Alan Duncan, the Tory member of parliament, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his house in his constituency.
The prison of the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members were " maintained ", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The House of Commons authorities received complaints at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is leading a review of the expenditure of members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be " clearer or more simple ".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the house of parliament, has a two - storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a greenhouse to the home, described in the plans as a ".
Neighbours described it as a " greenhouse for entertainment. "
He was not asked Mr Duncan to give during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on loans.
The Committee has acquitted him last month of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of their property in London to his constituency home, which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan until March last year, about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest rates.
In April, its claims to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that the increases were designed to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, the rate that is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continues to be in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as chairman of the opposition in the House in September, after a reporter supposedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive " on rations " after the expenses scandal.
" In fact, it is now national, you have to live on rations and be treated as m GDR. "
He said: " I have spent my money in my garden and I ask a tiny part, based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I do not. "
The Member, a millionaire from his former profession as oil trader, was questioned in the first place on their spending in May, when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that could be considered excessive ".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of the symbol of the pound sterling in the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after it was revealed that he had requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: " It was for improvements, adopted both by the office of salaries and subsequently by Legg. "
He added: " There is no problem of evasion or development or the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, in the rules, authorised, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "

But in any case, the result is not, said the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean - François Forget.

The news of Johnny Hallyday " are very positive, " according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday " are very positive, " said his son David on Friday at his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he visited his father in hospital for several days.
The news are very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, said the press David Hallyday at the exit from the plane to Paris shortly after the 13 h local (21 h GMT) .
The son of the singer, relaxed, assured that he would move " very quickly " to the hospital Cedars - Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was " placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to prevent suffer and to be able to administer his treatment, " said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars - Sinaï in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be réopéré in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of severe injuries caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié - Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has the Neurochirurgen Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinique international Park Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible demand, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had " much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon. "
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, because I operated twice discal, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently " party without drain, without anything, " after his operation in Paris.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly - sur - Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to a haematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor with dubious reputation, condemned on several occasions by justice, and for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the order of doctors, was accused of being " a man without scruples " defendant " regularly " before the Council of the order, and is " anything but advisable. "
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was " perfectly well " and that the results of the studies were " normal ".
The operation " could not provocarhemorragias and portanto, did not need drainage, " he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased since the summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the Modem party of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt takeover of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin of the party to use on any support, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP NC) who claims ownership of the trademark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of this, broke the silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and the Member intimándolos to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, You have made many statements suggesting that you were going to propose to his political movement to restore the acronym UDF, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
Also believe right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the + Nouveau centre +, and the slogan + the UDF +, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of sämtlichem material, as well as by (their) website ".
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette " to convey the property of (the) marks the legitimate ".
If you refuse, the courts would be to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF " is a real political movement since 1978 " and remember that Morin and his friends " have taken the election " to leave in 2007 " to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP ".
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy) .
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend " the material and moral interests " of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d ' Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, " when he filed the mark ", it was " no longer a member of the UDF for three years, " but the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to carry on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming crime, denounced, before a mockery of the strategy of the NC: " It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more to make a name for themselves to try to get out of anonymity taking fraudulently a name that is not entitled ".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François - Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François - Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of a state of weakness of the part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter are battling the reins of the cosmetics empire of L'Oréal.
But the 15th criminal Court also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be carried out by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the public prosecutor's office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010, in saying if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think that it will accept.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Georges Kiejman, out of the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal proceedings against François - Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which she sees as a longtime friend.
On Friday, While the court should examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers, the allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which he said that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: " could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak him since their marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was unable to appear, especially as a guardianship judge refused in recent days, to grant his request to open a judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full capacity to act, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place, " said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie - Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has Finally decided that once the trial on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt - Meyers.
Managers revolution or end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence have been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, said the position of the company vis à vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to " values " determined from above as it was made at the consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer to in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of customers regularly again!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects in particular the executives.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R& D and, even more importantly, of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the business intelligence) " demands that all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision "; it needs by employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the customer.
The usefulness of internal polls
The internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés - will encourage the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- in principle, because I could see that, faced with a new situation, and after many detours, to do ... what it has always done.
- Secondly, because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of the power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the large schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory, revived recently by the " neuroscience " American and research institutes and the media largely behind their backs.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the " leverage " (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. fr reaffirms the managers in a position of management, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, is taking a vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clearly as a means, to a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Today, only the studies from the analysis Motifuncional take this concept of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors of mobilization, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate its " social performance " and human resources " in the place ".
They create a fertile ground for the development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: the " just war " brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, The American right, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice - president in the elections of 2008.
I liked what he said, declared Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party to the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself addressed the subject of the war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done " a very good job " in Oslo.
I thought that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to " the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential.
At times, the speech I found very historic, said Mr. Gingrich, in the radio show " The Takeaway ".
The former elected, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a " president of the left " to remind members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free and could not provide a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist ".
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has " a very American speech ".
In addition to stand as " citizen of the world " as it always does, " " spoke as an American president, " to remind the Europeans " living in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do not to preserve it, " said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech " boring, pretentious and without inspiration " on the National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
However, The press centre - left praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech " overproduction " even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo " should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression, " the California newspaper.
The New York Times is of the opinion that Obama, " proclaimed the necessary discourse " and described his speech as " bleak and exemplary " at the same time.
Drivers: three marathon for an agreement that the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of negotiations marathon, the trade unions in the streets, and only employers ' organisation to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday night to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat on the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was " pleased " with the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were left in the morning Friday, with the hope of quickly to sign the agreement at the end of the morning.
And Even if three employers ' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 H was necessary to reach an agreement and the text is firm signed.
The conflict " would have been very damaging for business " and " it was feared that disrupt the festivities end of the year, " said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) , and 2.9% for the highest (international transport) .
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO) .
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it is " a good agreement ", although it was " difficult to give these wage increases in the face of international competition ".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for the employees, " said Maxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of " a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) is " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that " a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers ' was the subject of an amendment to the bill of the government the corrected finances for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote " an identical ".
The signing of the TLF allows that the agreement, for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be " as quickly as possible, " assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a " fool ", because the 100 million euro " had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax. "
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency, not as a shared analysis, but not to those who want to eat in the next Christmas Eve, laments the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement puts at risk " the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months. "

So early in the morning, the station of Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly because of the absence of students.
In Boissy - Saint - Léger (Val - de - Marne) , Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted " an hour and a half to get to work on time. "
The station Saint - Lazare has not, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and security forces.

The Turkish justice dissolved the pro - Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the main pro - Kurdish party in the country, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the task of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a " hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, " declared to the press, the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, with a majority of seven votes needed to get the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that 37 of the of the party, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
Furthermore, The judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity which enjoy Türk and Tugluk, and the seizure of the assets of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550) .
Their leaders had warned before the verdict that Members of Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accused the DTP to obey the " principles " of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, claims it has no organic links " with the PKK, but refuses to describe as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government is to extend a hand to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, for which the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south - east Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city of south - east populated by Kurds.
The police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
About 100 people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would " deepen the despair ".
Turkey can solve this issue (Kurdish, banning a party, " he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, " said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening launched by the government, said the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, " he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union constructing a strictly location for secret military research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, has the reputation of being the " Silicon Valley ".
Here are important centres of research and production of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the seat of scientific Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies in the centre of Frankfurt (FIZ) .
There were signed several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a " Protocol of close collaboration ".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, Frankfurt, Planungsdezernent Edwin black.
In 2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium - sized enterprises In the scientific research for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja - Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so - called " socialist planned city " for research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as " green City ") received its name from the forested hills landscape, in which settled research facilities.
Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can start not high enough.
For the proponents of the project is purely and simply " the new heart of Europe ".
Right. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of the capital of Baden - württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
With terminals, which end up in The middle of the city, were at that time as verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century, acting as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since it took a lot of time, umzuspannen locomotives back ahead.
In short, drive - to go further.
And That is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a spaceport, which is about half of the trans - European rail route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava where the slogan of " heart of Europe ".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have realised that it is in the remarks made and the Bavarian city almost impossible to implement the reduction.
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, however, since there are modern reversible with cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the new route after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have.
The train makes with, not least because the risks of the largest infrastructure Einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
From the point of view, the project is relatively well justified.
It creates new city area, which, according to the computergenerierten graphs of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time was not yet the competition from low - cost flights.
The modern transport policy must first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route, with its leanings, not for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be in the Schwäbischen are buried.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion is more realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade will lack the money in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of major projects are on The list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 will act as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the ban on night flights in revision.
The coalition of CDU/FDP appears to have commissioned experts to the more than 400 pages legal research of the judgment of the Dieter Posch (FDP) .
The administrative Court in Kassel had established on these days in writing that the country in the case of the planned construction of the north west runway at Frankfurt airport, the should regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p. m., as envisaged in the federal government, was not compatible with the legal protection of the population of noise at night.
The coalition has to decide until 4 January, if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the representatives of the government to for celui - cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer - Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, this could be it as a lack of floor.
It is difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP election slogan " We hold word ".
The Minister Dieter Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer - Gümbel who claims that the country's government would be trying to authorize the night flights using " avocasserie and roublardises ".
A comprehensive legal research would need some time.
The coalition did not on the basis of a " rapid first impression ".
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
So, As The opposition, been the statements of his group's ban on night flights.

The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, their state shackles.

Early Election
It was then everything faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board the editor - in - chief of Santa Claus Brender from office, the station a successor.
Yesterday evening The committee wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also the desire not to further damage to the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be accepted by the board of directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the body.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a significant defeat for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, not to want to Brender in his post.
Had organised the resistance against the editor - in - chief of the hessische prime minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender would have lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, has refused to accept another term of office of the hearing.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate specialists in public law, which described the act as unconstitutional.
To no avail.
The person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
After that, He worked in the Südwestfunk (Rhineland - Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 was changed to the ZDF, in principle " heute - journal. "
Subsequent ports: 1988 to 1990 personal advisor of the chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the programme " Morgenmagazins "; until 2001, of the foreign policy; since then, head of the study in the capital.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have a constitutional complaint
The opponent of Koch in the administrative Council, the President of the government of Rhineland - Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should change the Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the control bodies of the ZDF, However.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - when he criticised the body immediately after the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face, as well as the board, without into the a partisan office.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is left - wing liberals.
The study will entrümpelt
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the ministers and delegates to the conference of Presidents, both sides agreed to improve conditions in Bachelor and Master.
The students should be In the future, to be able to overcome their studies.
For example, agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: a single examination is to close the module of study.
In addition to examine the workload of the students, and to ensure " a realistic and acceptable ".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structure targets for Bachelor - and masters.
At the regional level, there should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Education and culture ministers and the presidents of universities have repeatedly in the mouth étudiabilité ".
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so - called accreditation council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: " Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination, " says in a 30 - page document, which aims to regulate the authorisation of curricula.
With the " significantly Reinhold Grimm, president of the accreditation Council said that reducing the burden of reviews should be able to prevent the slippage, which would significantly the étudiabilité.
The " étudiabilité " should be, in the future, the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined in detail on unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of.
The courses.
The Students should " have the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage the own initiative ".
Apply The rules for the authorisation of new, but also in the review of existing careers.
These must be " reacreditar " every five years, which means that it will take until 2015, and reviewed all studies.
Responsible's ten accreditation agencies, which are the accreditation, created by the countries of accreditation Council.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies, so that the programmes are not too big and not the testing regime is far too rigid.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
Rhineland - Palatinate is so far the only provide additional resources for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring programs and student advice, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and from outside.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
This is supposed to be for the conclusion of a studies model only one test.
The studies should be more flexible, the recognition of certificates to other universities and access to the master easier.
By the end of next year should be reviewed all studies of the country on their Studierbarkeit.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed again on the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of The decisions.
The federal Bureau of the Juso university groups, the design of the education policy should no longer " behind closed doors, " the Minister and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
The President of the board of Regents (HRK) , Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the We need the experience of the students, " she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
For the trade Union of Education and Science (GEW) the Bonn agreement as a whole does not go far enough: It calls for a legal right to each graduates with a bachelor close access to a cycle of master.
On the other hand, must ensure the countries that the current generation of students bachelor tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in master and as good as possible.
The countries have to be much more teachers.
But on greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
In Germany and is nice almost no control ... " is the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner, in which the experiences of arrival in Germany for a dissident, who won the freedom, but has lost both his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and later as of collection in a children's book publishing, before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993 kept the legendary Frankfurter Poetikvorlesungen the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has director of the forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the " German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files. "
Visibly unsafe and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted to his fellow writers such as Richard Wagner William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the prize of the German language.
The trials began in 1971.
I am, Söllner, " someone who has not sufficiently defended against attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate. "
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of dictatorial rule the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, and the evil of a political system in a case that based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his dossier of IM Walter had played a role, said the scientist literary Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of the internal Walter for him.
He had It in for him at the time sensitive points " herausgehauen, according to Markel.
" I feel the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany was a cosy reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the weekly " Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own record.
The people and in some case, what other name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter second - term.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the legacy of the Securitate files is still very vague.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS) was created in 1999, the launch of the acts since then, however, is more slowly.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the files.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller in this interview, a former head of the Securitate of the Prize winner.
" She had a psychosis, " in the end only once.
The infamy of power, said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the case Söllner, as so often when there is blame.
Why now? who has been harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners, the admission of Söllner, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by apportioning blame and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League
When the new coach of the football team VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of orange colour of the supplier of his team, took a taxi Mercedes Class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the a very nice Christmas, in which the hand.
The man in the feature had hired a driver, because we still do not know the city.
Otherwise he would be able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and he was not drunk with happiness.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In The words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: " we have achieved the final ", namely in the Champions League is true that we thanks to but we must not be blinded by the success: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania will be a brutally to fight against the decline. "
The " much more important task " on Sunday.
Then, it is to repeat in Mainz the success of the real " in the League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5) , Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11) .

The eighth final of the Champions League (16/17. + 23/24 February/return match 9/10. + 16/17 March) on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of winning the commencement of the Babbel successor was up.
Not only with the supposed saviours, of the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time self - confidence, had given goodwill and game.
I went with the players and I told them that they should concentrate on its strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the of souls Gross its recipe for success that sounds, but had ceased to have any effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann, " if in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would not have thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of break for injury, advanced the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " with the proverbial " fresh wind " and the way of the new leader: " He is a man who and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all.
As Gross, the players and the manager abstained from overstate the victory against a defence weakened by lack of and completely the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had a bad wake up, Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt warned that although it had reached a goal of the season, the other was still very far.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
To celebrate it was That Heldt in his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, the form of a television interviews before the start of the game goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just match.
There are decisions taken by others, and not Jens, in response to the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coaches under pressure from fans.
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele that his free day after the matches had been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were " characterised by the pure selfishness, " keilte Heldt and announced consequences for the zaguero.
They will Probably not friends for life, the two cuarentones.
But they were always bounced back with all other agreed that would have been without the work of the group by the coach replaced, strong and idea.
Babbel and his assistants had " a large part in the success, " said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and even the man in the plastic bag.

The case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of false information on the case Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left demand explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - following the most recent revelations about the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) , have cheated with knowledge of the facts.
The Minister said the deadly bombing of two on Saturday, transmitted by The television channel ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said in the news programme ".
This means that he lied.
The order to kill, was in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) .
This is the substance of the report that had NATO, and that has been read by Mr Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just a destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the air attack According to investigation report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured was launched at the request of Colonel Klein, commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , to decide as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and to clarify what really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of intentional killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin the colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.

So far it has not received a response, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see, awake, images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts fade the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
While happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms, we can do without hindrance to the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, experienced dream, hears and sees things that others do not hear in the modern Western world as to be crazy or drugged, or at least as.
But Such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of consciousness alert modified can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, and at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of the prophet of the new Age Carlos Castaneda, the psychosis and hallucinations similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of communication in the brain - especially the dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline is disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the same.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors Since ancient times.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861, a " great similarity between the madness to Sigmund Freud the dream was " a psychosis, with all the absurdities, composed ".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. transformed into a character.
His body is in two dimensions and scandalously colourful.
The gravity no longer has power over him, is floating near the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, showing teeth.
They are pursuing, with heavy boots and flameantes, cast against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Voices the walls and radio.
It can no longer bear the voices that insult and offend.
Henning T. snaps two cables from the stereo, knotet attached to a noose and consolidating them hooks in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and sets the noose around the neck.
The.
The rope was.
What you will serve as a lesson, the voices in a chorus that the tímpanos, sees the clinic and do you cure! "
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, moreover, it is, he takes medication, against The depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the most terrible fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in a life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the internal and the outside world, they are in a state of anxiety that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, megalomania, or persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing voices: voices that give orders, or.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate what is trivial, the brain can ausfiltern not no longer filter the disturbing signals, awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in the climate is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, everything has an importance to him.
At the same time it is in a passive role, it is a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Once seen in the life of a hallucinations To have
Unlike in the dream, according to Fuchs, " the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis, basically. "
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Why does exactly our brains antics, researchers are still puzzle.
Exceptional conditions can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, for example by a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, explained Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, occurs and the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, since they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brains
This is crazy, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and says Professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the order to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a question of The point of view.
Kasten collects for ten years reports of hallucinations and related phenomena, last year, he has his results in the book " the unreal world in our head. "
The hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Border Line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and head injuries.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are repressed.
They take form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hiperactivas or little; when our brains hot, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state in The same way that the brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the evil of love or other mental states.
In recent studies have been up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life of a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania and it goes to the school.
A normal girl.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair and the floor.
When he replies, take a look at the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little strange, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it is certain.
It is, hear and see the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting in the bank.
They can feel his presence even, at least for moments.
It is a pleasant feeling, they like the boys.
Am I crazy? , asks them sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
The visions are Often a burden.
When it is in class sometimes it can follow the course because the professor in their eyes and ears is presenting a new colleague, while for is invisible to others and that the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming, if the images they see, the grimaçants or the girl with cuts in arms and legs, with the bleeding before their eyes open or closed.
Let me in peace, they are the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, she knows that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
According to Kasten, When a person is isolated socially or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a certain time.
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his Unterhaltung.
Sarah K., single girl, was of little fear of other children and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when she learned to 13, that the man she called Daddy, since it was in age, was not his real father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas that are active in the the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. " every experience takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
Also night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special skill.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our world too focused on the conscience what experiences imaginary tend to generally patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a heavy, painful but which also contains something positive, creative - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard has investigated the so - called oneirismo, a particular form of awareness, which is perceived as a dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi - dimensional, detailed Quasi dreams, which are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in extreme situations of illness, for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía, experiencing a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a person is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total disability and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation very dangerous for its own imaginary world, the reality is, says rapier hard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning, in an intolerable situation, which allows people to design their own ability, not submerged in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also The art historian Peter Cornelius Classen, describes his experiences in his book " change of heart " as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years, when his consciousness for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valves with a heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care.
Claussen visited another in a selbstgeschaffene world, other times and places: he saw himself as bettlägerigen, old man, boarded a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages of nobles who drugs from blood.
He was abducted by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travel For Claussen fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
They are much more clear and more intensive than the real experiences.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of the rest of our other everyday experience, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and drugs show how fragile our internal figures of external reality in the guards.
Any change of the state of conscience, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, " can lead to a distortion of what we call reality. "
An experience which might also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will take charge of the publishing house with 27 years
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run future in the hands of his two children, he said the Spiegel.
100% of The holding will be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
The two children inherit with 27 years and have The firm will to enter the companies, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will afterwards.
Also, if they are able to do so.
You can easily ask not 7500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient.
This brings the children, and the company.
On Thursday Burda had announced that he is withdrawing from January by the presidency of the board and that Paul - Bernhard Kallen his successor.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board since 1999.
First It was responsible for the technology.
Later came with the Treasury's responsibility for the corporate wealth and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer heritage of the company also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, is not a member of the family at the head of the Verlages.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which is now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to, " 10, 15 years to bridge, " Burda.
100% of the holding will be in the hands of the family.
With regard to The cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said Burda that family businesses folding certain: " it was always families who have been infected by a capital addiction, which have they could rise still higher.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had " delusions of grandeur, " says gross.
I do not see as the country's political Präzeptor, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with Time, these businesses have become too big.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail, without even able to see some kind of Deputy or surf the Internet.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea is interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited as his American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, approximately 12 euros per month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border or seek desperately a cafeteria with WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should in fact be possible for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience takes a doctorate in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe hardly have had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin are afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
That A small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is a device connected and pay for it at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, an option to purchase with access to life as Peek already in the United States.
Not because I will to buy it.
I watch my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe that it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the American first lady of the United States.
The inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken a model very similar in both occasions: in addition to being a similar colour - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes, twice the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and it was the with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at first glance it appears that the first lady of the United States followed the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which are the two suits makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
Also The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and a similar model, but in Golden, this time.
The hairdressing also has changed: the hair were put on this occasion as hair the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
The Discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the younger generation who want to be mothers.
It reveals the study " fertility and career women in Spain, " conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw their career opportunities in the workplace because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and the type of work.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part - time work or have a stable work not have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
By contrast, women with a stable employment, mainly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood, and therefore have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure that rises to 4.1 women with have needed more time in your life to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work played exerts great influence on motherhood, albeit less on the timing of the pairing, " explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap of the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
" another is also among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those of average levels or higher invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child, " Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth

The trip is exciting and Vincent spares scares or not.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and relecturas.

In itself, he said that he was the legacy of a landowner in the county and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams of greatness. "
On Louis - Ferdinand Céline: " This writer took up the cry insane thrown from a bridge by the personality of Munch to its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and it did in the leak itself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms. "

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years of age by our neighbourhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years, to her and our dog, a sang - mélé, rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they beat him two kicked that left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is great because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous attack to a small and defenceless animal, which of course, was leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and that, when these individuals came to fear for their physical integrity, attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, weaker than him.
The incident occurred at 5 p. m. on a Tuesday as another in a normally quiet.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nahgelegenen police service, however, we doubt that much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to consider fun a defenceless animal that they find to mistreat We love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for road Safety (Fesvial) , has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, reported today the two structures.
This initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer " and said that it also contributes to this objective by other actions educational and informative.

The sale of light commercial
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, However, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
Consequently, despite the surge in the last month, the the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles that make up the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick up, vans, vans and light trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, have not gone away the clouds that most affect their demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium - sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
So in addition to the restrictions of the tap closed for bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and unlike cars, aid for the purchase of the little used.
In addition to individuals, the self - employed and small businesses that will acquire a commercial slight of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, since Ganvam to remember the need for the administration to devote special attention to these vehicles and also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The association of dealers predicts a similar to the year 2010 a year, for which estimated a fall in sales (for passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency brake is now mandatory
As happened with the anti - lock brakes ABS and as will happen with the ESP stability control systems will have to be a compulsory element on European cars.
In fact, They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest is set a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, even if, by his way to work, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detected by the driver.
But it is not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to step on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revancha, requires the braking system, reducing the distance that used the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with greater - it is estimated that the popularization of so - called intelligent emergency braking a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8 - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers first and then the governments of the countries in which there are factories, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used the engineers Boxster S as a base and that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the báscula in only 1,275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof has been replaced by a roof manual, save 21 kilos; using doors of aluminum as the GT3, ' other 15 kilos of the climatizador, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of 12 and with the slight of 19 inches, five.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system Cdr - 30 brought six kilograms and changing the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK available, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual box of six speeds, mainly for secondary roads of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb.
Rather, the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short running for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and grow again its engine ...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or inconvenient.
The asphalt roads that we have travelled with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had barely act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves ice at dawn and gravel, later in the morning.
In summary, a car, more fun to drive and that is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70.831 euros.

The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a resounding triumph in 91-82 during his visit on the ground of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences of the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight three points was the best of his team (29) .
The team was able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of involvement and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triple had much to do in the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the start.
Since The fact that the first four baskets of the vitorianos were from the perimeter it was forecast that they had jumped on the ground with his wrists hot.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the game inside Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause in the return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43) .
Teletovic already began to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points, although the " minus six " assessment of Splitter already guess that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on track to rest, nothing was played, and the wanted to remind the team of Avala and thanks to the " hand of Elías " they came into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49) .
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed a couple of right for breath, and these came machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas reassuring (54-67) , and that the hosts at the end of the third quarter (57-67) .
The Alavesen exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60 60-75) has already announced that they would allow them the victory, which they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, not and tried to keep alive his team from the line of three points (70-77) .
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by mistakes, not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis have converged at the last minute (80-85) , the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevented that was the Unicaja
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had given him the lead in Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of the players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) , which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team malagueño not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship nor by the scale of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter, helped to dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three consecutive triple, two of the basis Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, dazzled in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with a home game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave the return to the scoreboard 22-20, the minute 13, when an action, of fighting the North American leaders Beverley and Williams, was the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team began operating in showing their superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the pivot English Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Among domestic players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas, with its triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute.
A rebound impossible
The third period was very offensive to the Olympiacos, despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to match the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48, in the 27th minute, which in turn the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last drop of the Scottish pívot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the disadvantages the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, and the three of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to pick up the basket 81-62, minute, and the Unicaja off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially end.
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that " Mel " knows that he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has refugee since 21 September
" He is aware that he must go on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, it must seek another destination. "
The station also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: " My position is to leave as soon as possible, naturally with the support of the government of Brazil, " Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected) , Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally failed, since Zelaya refused the status of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty in the markets, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the players make decisions on the future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and, without questioning their heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with next week.
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, although they remain very still a long way from the levels achieved at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by investors, leading to an extension of the differences between the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard& Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, trying again to create a matter of awareness in global economic policy that had hindered the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is declare a new day of action.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal fight between the emirs to restore the power in the him to the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year to a breach of its external payments saves and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, would be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, as our differences of public debt increase to the extent of the European corporate bonds should not worry.
If the European and continued to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our predictors oblige most services studies to anticipate their recovery and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment " caution ".
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of gas Natural - Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, gave the press a few key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another $60 million between then and 2030, where nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
Should this not be the case, the necessary investments to $60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be used to increase the production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the issue is changing, and it will have to increase the power.
His gamble focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, with other " energies of support. "
Galán, who believes that the draft law of sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government is in line with what his company, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is " a clear in the long - term " in this direction, despite the measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
It says Galán, believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for his first motorway in concession in Australia, market in which already works as a company manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros) .
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A tunnel of 5 km long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the option closer to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a construction company and of motorways.
The city of the city wants to have by the end of 2014.
After opting for the public - private partnership (PPP) to complete the project, in a business plan under the tutelage of Erns& Young, the administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
In anticipation of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and Ghella.

The Australian market infrastructure promises major projects and privatisation, but carries a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that have followed the companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to their Asian references, and issue for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Barely ACS has achieved a position in this market through its 30 per cent stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets millionaires

The timetable set by the administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic in recent months of 2014, it is not anticipated that the work will continue until 2016.

Their participation in the Champions League has brought reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona since 476.4 million, putting them at the third and fifth place of clubs who have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million to the 105 teams (12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and The F. C. Barcelona have been well from this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive more money for his participation, and the only one, along with AC Milan, which has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, the current champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the classification.
The list of the lead Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, in addition, more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, by the Champions of League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy, three of England and Germany two) .
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million through the Champions League.
This money UEFA will devote 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary round of classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to other euros for each party.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team) . the octavofinalistas will receive three million each; the eight cuartofinalistas, 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each received 4 million.
The champion won 9 million, compared to the 5.2 million finalist.
So, in fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, which are scheduled for the 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional to the value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the key, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition, distributed.
