The strategy of the Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify its policy of a necessity of the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, such a hoax calls the myth that election fraud is less common than the number of people who die in the United States hit by lightning.
Republican lawyers, after all, in the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine America's democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states have the responsibility for the organisation of the federal elections in the US.
And in that spirit, a majority of the US government since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult to process the elections or to register on the electoral roll.
This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which more 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, it was only for 2011 to 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present identity card with a photograph and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limiting the period for the elections in advance, zneplatňují odnímají citizens the right to vote and the right to register on the list of voters on election day registration is a clean criminal record.
Before the election, in 2006, called on the electorate půkazu identity photographs with no American state.
Indiana was the first state to introduce this requirement.
The constitutionality indianského law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican officials hurried to the enlargement of this process as well as in other states.
In the last two years to support proposals for such legislation in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to submit to identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact owns 11% of American citizens, that is, at the age of 21 million people to vote, no identity card with a photograph issued by a government authority of the state.
In addition, about five million new voters in 2012 does not have an identity card.
In addition, the acquisition of the card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affects mainly young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years has therefore required identity card with a photograph.
And that's not all.
The students, who are known as voters to shift to Democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use their identity card with a photograph displayed his school.
On the other side of the same states allow members to use cards issued by those clubs, hunting or fishing clubs who elect more Republican candidates in the elections.
In 2004, a certificate of citizenship require no state at the polls.
The first such a requirement led Arizona.
From 2011, about a dozen states adopted laws, which require voters to show that they are American citizens.
These actions are obviously going to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Be it noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic side.
Republican legislators support the laws in eight states in 2011, which removes the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have their consequences.
During the campaign for the general elections in 2004, for example, the registration of voters have registered around 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009 but caused a decline in registering new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008 in Florida were African-American 33% of voters who voted in advance, although afroamerických voters in this state, there were only 13%.
As was the case with Hispanics.
24% of the citizens of voting in advance, but made up only 11 percent of all voters.
On the other hand, whites accounted for 76 percent of all voters were only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have turned against the approval of laws that restrict voter registration is, of course, very strongly.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with his veto.
With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Prosecutor-General of the United States.
The damage is partly limit.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states adopted laws requiring proof of identity with photographs.
The newly introduced rules, however, completely undeniably impedes the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics talk about bias approved laws and is regarded as an obvious attempt to influence the results of the election in 2012 in key states.
Brennan's report shows that the states where those laws were approved centres of 2011, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is already certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine America's democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: Undergo examinations or not?
The PSA test was sometimes false positive results, which were wrongly negative or even wrong, leading to unnecessary medical emergencies.
All of this increased the hesitancy of the men, who are already reluctant even to go for testing.
Let's investigate or not?
We asked two experts on the view.
In studies conducted in the US has shown a high degree of contamination between test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, noted the different mortality rate among patients who undergo testing, and those who go to them.
The study also demonstrated after 12letém apart, and that those who go for tests, they have a higher risk of 30 to 40% of that.
I recommend testing from 50 years of age or from 40 years, therefore, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Their group are also men Afro-American origin.
The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.
There are such species, which are inert and aggressive types of cancer.
It is therefore necessary to explain to correct the patient the degree of danger of his kind of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which is in the long-term impact on life, and to focus instead on the active surveillance of the disease in these cases.
Today, many of the men with whom she was diagnosed with cancer, left untreated, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive and is a threat on his life.
We will propose them instead of active surveillance and, in the case of progression of the disease, offering the treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision setting criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and who does not.
Yet recommend testing is complete.
The important thing is to determine whether or not it is appropriate to undergo testing and interviewed by a doctor.
In cooperation with the International urologickou companies created a tool that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the Movember movement in connection with PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research seems to be the best means to reduce the risk of disease acceptance of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently move, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.
"If they stop smoking, that figure would be increased to at least 50%," underscores Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian company for cancer research.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% cancer causing heredity.
Some percentage also remains totally unexplained.
For the Canadian company for cancer research remains a priority of the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes worth 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It is extremely harmful to human health.
"Today's 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," a spokesman for Andre Beaulieu said, shaking his head.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, decreases the risk of death from cancer by half.
Mass
Stoutness and obesity, according to SCC, another risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal and esophageal, pancreatic and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In the event of excessive consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid even the sausages, which are subject to the same thing.
The preservation of smoked meat, or drying, salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists focused on the link between cancer and vitamínovými accessories.
The research, however, has not yet revealed clear conclusions.
Under the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
Although, according to one of them, is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks more to increase it.
Even the effect of vitamin D to cancer is clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu insists, furthermore, how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.
"Submit to testing does not mean that you have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likelihood of the Higgs discovery bosonu caused a stir last summer.
There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence the standard model predicts - our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, still not 100 percent certainty that the Higgs boson.
Doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu bosonu, as predicted by the standard model.
New data released this week during a physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but it still lacks any data so that we can have absolute certainty.
But suppose the Higgs boson, because of the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what's happening.
In this world is absolutely unambiguous law, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard for it, otherwise you're gonna get hurt.
Although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies even to her: Pauli exclusion principle, according to which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "status" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
It further divided into two categories of particle physicists.
On the one hand we ordered citizens, or fermiony, which obediently comply Pauli principle.
And at the other end of the line move bosony, wretched anarchists who do nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means it could be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups, according to equipment (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley laboratory: Mesony, here we go unnoticed, and "force particles," which is of great natural strength and with which is Higgs boson probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosony are not as exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe.
If they read this article, it is thanks bosonu with unusual banality: The photon, or particle of light, "which is" holder "of electromagnetic force."
When, in fact, inset with particles are accelerated or change its course, "disturbed" by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into a pond.
From this "distraction" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than the photon - and hence one bosonů, "geothermal power."
A more stable field
Nor is it with Higgsovým bosonem, except that "disturb" it should be the other field, Higgsovo field, appeared to be the boson.
This Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it is necessary to achieve very high energy levels, as with the frozen surface of the pond, already ripples just a lot of a large boulder.
For this reason it is to be used as part of a giant accelerator as the accelerator at the laboratory CERN - large Hadron Collider has friendly ties is a circle with a circumference 27 km! - in order to exert the kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field to us once again throws to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and matter.
Do not react with the electromagnetic field because not all particles or all materials.
Some, such as magnets, doing so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, never by himself to stick on the fridge.
And it is true that all the particles do not react with the Higgs field: Those that do have some mass, while the others (as, for example, a photon, look at him) don't have it.
And Mrs. Smith asks to do all of these studies are, what "bring us?"
From a scientific point of view, it is a validation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any inconsistency between SM observations and predictions.
More than a few physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open a "new physics" space and close some of the loopholes in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still huge gaps, no clarification of gravity (whoa whoa!) or dark matter, which is about 80% of cosmic mass (again).
So far, however, the CERN facilities showed such contradictions.
The response
The response of this research in everyday life very difficult for Mr. and Mrs. Novákových can be predicted, would be a mistake to assume that there will be no.
Behold: At the very beginning of the 1960's laser pioneers in Bell Labs had no idea about the revolution is already causing their work.
Assuming the scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he created the first permanent a laser beam (previous beams were pulse) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a toy "to the lab."
Imagine that.
And in addition, exercise may result from any instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at optics.
The sensor, although Boyle's first ever as planned, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that the activities of us around the LHC is bound to change your life, but it means that you never really know....
Palliative care - the best way to go from life... | Le devoir
Through his Commission for dying with dignity, Quebek recently engaged in delicate questions concerning the rest of his life.
The debate should soon to continue and, at the same time, about the bill.
In this crucial area, a lot of work remains to be done.
The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Only a few weeks before Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"Were it seven and five years of my life," he says without emotion in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: The extreme weakness prevents him from himself to go to the bathroom, or to eat alone.
Resignedly looking at appetizing breakfast and agrees to help him to eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking with strangers who stop by, brings his medication, they offer a bath.
The courage to a death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, that diminishes me," confers.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors in his problem.
"Throughout his life, the man teaches that men urinate standing up," Victor-Gadbois tells Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the facility.
To return to the stage for some people, the child is unacceptable humiliation.
"Depending on a person's ability," whether or not to accept the return, says psychologist.
In the view of many people that deal with the crucial moments, palliative care, taking place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who are in a home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
The forecast is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, they do not provide a team of doctors and nurses who cared for them, the so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die of suffocation "fully conscious."
The illness but allowed me to find their children.
"I've got good kids," he adds.
"In my life I have no desire," he says, and then allow us to put her breathing apparatus.
Yet it is still looking forward to the son of Italy's last visit in the coming days.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois is awarded custody of the body with the help of nutrition in cooperation with a group of volunteers.
It looks like palliative care, which is where they can no longer do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Québeku strikes one berth palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.
It is very little, if we realise that we all die some day.
Here, life goes on in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics at the home.
Whatever the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
When a man dies, it may give him a sip of brandy or Pepsi, for example, according to taste.
Diabetics are no longer required to watch the blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night Mr X. carrying beer, who died later in the night.
This morning drinks beer his son in honor of the deceased father.
"Helping patients as well as their relatives," says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing services.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois coming one after the other, but unlike the other days.
The man who is thoroughly enjoying from the last meeting with his family beside třiadevadesátiletého vypodložený on cushions, while his restaurant in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after testing all options in order to survive.
"It is half a year here every three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.
53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% then from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering, as soon as the sick person comes into the final phase of his life, whether it's at home, in the hospital and in a halfway house.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and domestic palliative treatment for the Company of Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
And just this crucial non-availability of health care in Quebec leads to a series of doctors specialising in palliative care fears the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard LaPointe, in which show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure all people access to high-quality palliative care, before it will be possible to agree with the implementation of the euthanasia.
As he says, a patient who had recently spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, without anyone took the necessary steps to be relieved.
Fears that patients did not ask for the killing on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care their patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative forecast.
The chance of survival by Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, leaving intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce out with the treatment, said that he regrets that I fight, tells us.
And he told me that it's over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martelová estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanking his treating physicians to fill their wishes, when their team palliative pussy ease the pain.
But it is necessary to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care to patients in palliative care at home for the Company of Grand Montréal prevents the treatment of pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, that the patient is anesthetized until death, whatever fits and starts, or whether they are administered a sedative to him on a permanent basis.
We cannot pretend that this part of the suffering.
The patient, who beat the pain, will have greater access paliativním sedation.
The sick, which is not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," rather, it means "I want to get rid of the pain."
The implementation of this story has a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in the health sector.
A large-scale real estate scandal in Quebec
Administration officials roads, public works and entrepreneurs in the construction industry, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which mix construction, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
This "specialty" came from Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system crumbled since we have taken serious measures," says ironically Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It erupted in 2011 scandal on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on embezzlement of funds in connection with the contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which then Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest approved after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque financing parties and corrupt government officials.
"Even from the beginning of the investigation in 2010," she says, "save only the Ministry of Transport on procurement of a billion dollars," when some people keep in check his instincts to gain market share on them!
Charbonneauova Commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he adds, with the hope that she will "rozkrýt the subtlety of some people."
Permanent unit for combating corruption based in 2011
Permanent unit for combating corruption is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts based in 2011.
A police officers' Marteauovy company "who, since 2009, to ensure that the cartel montrealský" penězovodů "soften significantly inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, a number of local councillors conducted a number of searches and accused of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a municipality on the outskirts of the city.
Next on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his office, the mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest of Quebec City.
It is suspected that repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received the traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, for example, Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when the commission explained the mechanism of the "system" of public procurement.
He gave during these years of 3% of the value of the contracts, which have obtained v Montréalu, a middle-man associated with the Mafia, which then transferred the money side of the Union Montréal, for which ran the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was generous in all directions after 2000 and spent more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) provincial parties, in particular, however, liberals, who were in power at the time.
Also confessed to organizing the illegal gathering of finance for the former Liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
The contract with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal, a system of "corruption" worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him before the commission in great detail: During the ten years had received an invitation to trips, gifts, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money from construction companies in return for contracts worth a total of $736 000 with penězovody, for which nadsazoval price.
Other transport sphere of public officials admitted that they had paid the fees that about 30% to 40% overestimate invoices through false víceprací.
The organizer of the mayor's Party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye that without embarrassment squinting over the parallel budget, which was dirty money into his coffers.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay stepped down at the beginning of November, which plunged Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members who issued a warning signal.
As the mayor of the district of Rivière-des-prairies to the east of the island has since 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of a prosperous trade with real estate.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation, which will be opened at last, he says, that "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the operation of the system promořeného ants to halt gangrene and načapalo culprits."
The process is "painful but positive," according to her.
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but it should be set up in Montréalu own investigative unit and supervision to ensure these dubious practices cannot go back.
Like cleaning.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials were estranged from hundreds of millions of dollars," but fears, in particular, the role of the "deputies informed about this ruse" to those dealing though!
Estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Québeku comes from the irony with money laundering, and adds: "I've heard that it was only a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to parties to $100, but that it will not solve the situation: "Until severely restrict election expenses, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control system for the allocation of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "Lower can't fall; if we focus on the substance of things we can build on a sounder basis again courageously and with greater control and compliance with the law."
If this story defamed image abroad in Montreal and Quebec, Duchesneau recommends that all those who deride him to look at their own backyard.
"PSG is FC Barcelona!"
You're in this season with PSG notched a completely new momentum.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went into each other, or an entirely new dimension PSG.
They came to us in the big leagues.
Every day will get further beside them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day I allow these facts to enhance the level of the game.
And it is easier in wrestling.
In football everything's going very fast.
Neztrácím but his head.
Since my beginnings in prep school in INF Clairefontaine after crossing into Saint-Etienne, I have always pushed for each grade.
Using the competitive environment, therefore, which led Carlo Ancelotti.
Reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every workout is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has more flavor in the match, and he wants to give the maximum power.
And it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in connection with my position.
To his assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti's decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
Today is not equal in the first league and is among Europe's best coaches.
He has vast experience and the top teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
For me to win more titles in Paris.
In January, it is comforting conversation I had with him.
I've had a number of injuries behind him.
The trust, which gives me, is another reason of my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the season for PSG?
In the first league to us Lyon took the leading position.
But remain in tow.
The Champions League is one of our main objectives: We're very easily advanced to unbelievably calm.
What is your club in this competition target?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a match for the quality of the European teams.
We want to win its qualifying group ahead of Porto, in order to be able to play in retaliation unbelievably calm at home.
PSG may be a great European club in the short term?
The budget has already on it.
To become a great European club, Paris has to make history and win titles.
Today it is not yet the case.
On the financial side, PSG has means that this project could take place.
And it would be a big setback nezvítězit in 1 last season as the league?
Of course, it would be a major disappointment.
This year we really want to win the league title.
In last season's still missing.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We collected 79 points.
Generally, with 79 points, you're a champion.
But another club, Montpellier, the season was even more astonishing.
For this year, I don't think it will.
Although the title to the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think, that we have weapons in order to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what was invested here and what we have the players.
It absolutely accept.
It is a fact that when home beat Troyes 4-0 and still find something about us in the newspapers, so it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what people from you can still want more.
It is not, of course, winning 4-0 on each weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to adjust his game style.
You need to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which is already the second season neprobojoval into unbelievably calm, and he invested large sums of money, too!
Whereas invested sums could be expected that you have 15 points ahead in front of the others.
Thus you insult the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which went too far in last season, with new PSG moved into the next phase.
This shows how 1 League is amazing.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that it says that there is "Zlatanovi dependency."
That means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful and that makes a lot of goals.
Because of that came here and shows that the star's first league.
Wherever we went through, has proved to be a big player, a world star.
On our team we respect man and the players.
He also respects the people around him.
What he accomplished is really exceptional.
This has led others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the concurrent growth.
How did you experienced French representation with Euro 2012?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately I couldn't play because of injuries as well as I'd imagined.
But I've seen it, and I came out of it stronger.
Today I'm going to play good matches in the entertainment.
And in that I had hoped since its entry into the team.
We are learning lessons from what has happened in Ukraine, and now owe it to ourselves, to our behavior has been exemplary.
What you're looking for the first month Didier Deschampse at the forefront of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In the qualification for Ms we're in a good place.
The coach is strictly is close to the players, and can get excited for the victory.
This was Laurent Blanc, too.
But I don't want is a comparison.
Blanc has reached his goal that we have qualified for the Euro.
I hope, Didier Deschamps lead our team to Brazil.
A first-place tie (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting the match?
This game for us added confidence.
We are all fighting for the team.
Before the shock in Spain I experienced such a game in his career.

As is often true in the context of these technologies is here to feel the obvious political vision: The belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
The Bitcoin inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents how virtual money (transferable, however, in dollars, the euro...), so secure transfer protocol similar BitTorrentu, which allows for the exchange of files between the pair of partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network has already been registered around 200,000 transactions.
About a thousand Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Kurz bitcoinu first reached all-time highs of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, he dropped to 2 dollars, today is on the verge of about 10 dollars (an overview of the courses is included on page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison to the world in exchange for real money or financial products, it is not impressive.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in his report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin describes as "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "equal to the current money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money that is used for the procedure as "credits" in a video game that gets in the way the game or that he can buy (and sometimes even back to exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month but the central government controls and processes of individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu Depositary current account books, the controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers are all the nodes of the network.
How the network works?
Each transaction between two users are, in fact, between two electronic addresses using e-mail.
The user may, however, choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with double key encryption system.
The network so it can verify the legality of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoiny existed in the public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in the entry of this new transaction in this book.
Proceeds help solve mathematical task zadaného computers, the investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
It is about the cutting stage set, i.e. the transformation of a giant set on shorter and unique digital print.
The computer "hits" this new transaction and add to her number, then the whole "chop."
The aim is to find a number, which provides specific print a lot of zeros (at the start).
As soon as he finds this number, the other nodes to check its accuracy.
The transaction is indestructible display connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would have changed the impression.
If a user wants to pay for the purpose of fraud twice the same money very quickly behind (in ten minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer, which will resolve the challenge, bitcoinů 50 wins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration on a regular basis is divided in two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited the number of 21 million, however, they can share to stomilióntinu, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty in negotiating the task is also increased with increasing levels of the calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The website, which for Bitcoin provide services, were attacked and alienation has imposed bitcoinů.
"used crack is not related to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, real money payments for the company, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering because of this anonymous service.
But the problem is also true for cash.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the platform WordPress blogs, is adopted.
ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron z Weizmannova Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book current accounts and showed that almost 80% bitcoinů circulation.
"big discounts" had been launched in November.
"It changed thirty thousand dollars," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul dealing with a turnaround bitcoinů into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author pedagogical books relating to this money, he has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment on her cell phone, but uses the Bitcoin system for verification of the transactions, which are cheaper because of it.
In addition, the bearer manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easily set by traders, where there is no need to install new devices or software.
You just have to disclose the address, which is on the phone "ofotografovat and recognize," explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and a transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the year 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, the ECB in its report implies a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be a success.
We've gone from Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (in the Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and American forces should be followed by the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take control over its territory and the Afghans to elect its own future and expect to everything from us.
Most of the injury suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punish them, as we consider them terrorists.
And we, too, we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and all those injuries and mutilation.
Talibánci are composed of former leaders, foreign extremists, who have fled to Pakistan, but often regards the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their archaic and ancient traditions, even though the jihadists have joined in, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbekové, Tajiks.
Tolerance and frequent aid is currently experiencing local insurgents, but if Western forces will withdraw their support.
The departure of French troops from the foundations of the Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains jewelled mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, proceeded in an orderly manner.
A convoy of trucks and armored vehicles arrived to Kabul without challenging for aerial escort helicopters.
By the end of 2014 already in Kabul will talibánci so active.
Since their unstoppable process between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country was in blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
They take control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghans paid the price for these villagers' obscurantism, which completely dominated organization Al-K 'Ido, their to our time, however, the situation has not improved.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and contemporary talibánci agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
Become hustlers, zmocňovali state land, which is sold as building sites for refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and take advantage of the huge American contracts to a subcontractor.
Discredit the; the majority of them, never been in a fight.
According to what I heard in campaigns, people yearn for the government, which will form the thieves.
Many of the young wants to leave so as to leave those who were able to take advantage of American generosity: Capital flight is significant.
The young no longer associated with it and are tired of the war of ideology.
During exile in Iran or in Pakistan, they took the modern world and its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; one fifth of the total population, currently 5 million inhabitants live in Kabul.
In the cities are full of public school, girls and boys go there.
These young people will need to provide jobs, they are no longer willing to return to the obscurantism of previous parties or to corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; Turkish serials and television show of the modern world, are everywhere.
The army is already present.
The authorities, will stand in her forehead, will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army already renewing provincial militias, which are outside the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should they should enjoy a degree of decentralisation along the lines of the Western states, but the US wanted her to turn on a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, and led to the cancellation of the post of prime minister, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai wants foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country is significantly dependent on foreign aid from the 1950's and earlier years.
No industry has not been restored, no dam is not working, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, the only fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative takes precedence.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would have been necessary government control infrastructure.
Rumors flew of Afghanistan has a vast mineral wealth.
And it's just fueling the feeling that Western nations were here only to capture him.
Without the processing power of iron ore and copper on the spot and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains but no minerals cannot take place.
The Chinese nearly abandoned mine at Mes Aynak copper and let international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the possibility of a large Buddhist area, in order to retain a role most important employers throughout the province.
One day it will also be important for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends a great deal of imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat units has been completed on November 20.
A new cooperation agreement foresees the resumption of normal types of assistance: Girls' and boys' lyceum, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 work initiative "to get the heart and soul," a difficult task trying to reconcile the aid and military activities, under which then caused service "civil-military actions," the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but reached by small French non-governmental organisation of a series of successes in the areas of common interest and steps for agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
The work, which involves a number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurgency, wells, irrigation, soil conservation, reforestation, drinking water, fruit trees and the expansion of cultivable land.
What memory consecutive leave after two billion military spending?
A more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2,000 m
The embassy received dozens of small agricultural aid applications from local communities in Kapisa province.
These farmers to be liberated from the uprising led by foreign groups, want to achieve in his words a civil assistance in their favor, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
Hard work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Mursí turned to another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most in its history divided over the publication of the Constitution, which grants him temporarily unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
On Wednesday announced the next day regardless of the opinion of all the others that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final version.
Less than a week earlier by the head of state of this meeting in the next two months to complete the necessary work.
Egypt already uses almost two years the makeshift text, which was supplemented many times, which undermines the stability of the country and leads to a legal argument.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the country's ambivalence.
From the perspective of the opposition the president stays in his "autocratic delirium," to "violates his word" and "tramples on the right."
His supporters, however, assure that this is a means to deal with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, and to speed up the process of transition.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
It is a very short time, which forces the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians article by article.
It is also a way for the president to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country batter protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly Time, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or keep the unlimited powers," which would otherwise should end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text with a large majority of the Islamists.
The majority of Liberals in the vote was missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, bouchli door with the fact that they do not have the option to impose their views.
Defenders of human rights, of civil society or religious minorities in their stride.
In order to achieve a quorum, yesterday morning was quickly followed by 11 people from among the replacements.
Some of them are very close Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators are also suspended over the fact that the day was one of the few disputes revolved around the clock... for a prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the clock in the conference room are not properly adjusted.
The text that was put to the vote yesterday evening, is composed of 234 articles.
The subject of widespread attention, Article 2, remains, in the end, identical to the version and the 1971 constitution provides that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the primary requirements, hoping that he will be replaced by the term "principles" Marriage "rule," which would allow stricter application.
The fact that this article has not been repaired for the Islamists, is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argued the liberals, who see it as just a problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
Focusing particularly on Article 220 that al-Azhar University conferred an advisory role, especially on the issue of control of the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to an expert on Egypt Sophie Pommierové it is disturbing, because "people are not competent to comment chosen and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
One can see the beginnings of theocracy in it. "
The fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the existing fuels fears of even more.
"For the moment, the result has not shown any particular religion.
With this Constitution remains Egypt framed by the state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but the university staff, many of them trained in French schools, "Alexis Blouet moderates concern, which is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, agrees with the fact that "there may be differences over the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belongs to the religious vocabulary.
In particular, the reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, cf note] is here.
And the question to what extent they are civilian judges have to be able to express "may emerge in the future.
Yesterday approved the text is very criticized because of the extended powers, which is given by the President of the Republic, in addition to the religious sites.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that their significant limitations as opposed to the former regime had occurred.
Another contentious point: The powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of military leaders not to carry out the verification of the budget for the defense of the parliament, but the National Council of Defense.
Then the proceedings with civilians, as demanded by the association for the protection of human rights are not prohibited in military courts
These associations speaks to them in connection with the text, which is directed against freedom of its misgivings.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult remains banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article does not deal with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová from the Human Rights Watch organisation.
According to her, the only positive point is the ban on torture set out in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was speaking last night in a televised speech, rallies are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the heads of state will demonstrate Saturday.

The tourists, a word

On the road it is better not to take the money with them in euros, but in dollars, which can easily change for shekels (1 dollar is now around 3.8 shekel).

"Good and powerful," it announced in Moscow: Emigrants to save money on your tongue
While members and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, in a country already discovered fraudsters who sell the certificates "counterfeit"
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities arrive each year 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families back home.
The law came into force on 1 December, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass the test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and urban economy, lifestyle, and retail sales.
FMS promises, however, that over time, the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
But the test will consist of the bases of law and not only in language skills, but also in Russian history.
Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to attest to the extension and obtaining a work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the official language is Russian.
This law are not people who are successfully achieved the attestation and obtain academic degree by the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights
The network test sites will work under the auspices of The Institute of the University of the friendship between the peoples of the Russian language, Moscow State University, the State University in St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
The migrants may consist of tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers in Russia is already open.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing support as well as members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders could ask many times in the press, the question is: What it really will bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, with the representatives of the migration service, allowing it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Today, many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the Chairman of the Board of Directors FMS Russia's Viktor Sebelev in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.
Only 90% of the system will allow organized recruitment to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise in the case of the emigrants without education, without the profession, who do not know the language and they don't have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant is convicted of clashes with unfair to people who will ensure a "voucher" under the pretext of aid ghastly, cramped quarters, in which dozens of others, like himself, and he will suffer for months without food and documents and work for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our own migrant workers receive many complaints.
"In their own country they promise one thing, but after the arrival of a lover, confiscate their passports, paid the promised salary," confirms the Key Manager Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Nenadávejte!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, intending to go to work in Russia, acknowledge that not only do not know the language of the country into which they want to go, but they don't have the experience, even with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, as more misery: Very few Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmen can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families are in need of something to feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be decently dressed, equip and fit into the school.
As children mature into productive age, has to go to work at the first opportunity.
It is hard to acknowledge - without the knowledge of the language.
"Feeling the humiliation and inferior."
It is true that, having regard to the law on language tests suggested one important thing for human rights defenders.
The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If they do not have him, so they did not pass the examinations, nor any other official work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers live in the same way as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Nepovolaným forbidden"
Many of the workers claims that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason - all the language difficulties and bureaucratic obstacles.
In addition, legalization cost money: From 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the false registration may be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousands.
The Russian police employees know that we have, in fact, false documents, without authorization, and implied blackmail cases.
"Vyžadují a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov shared with reporters about their experiences.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy the painting"
On the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, it was found that not only the documents for registration of migrants are false.
FMS employees already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the test.
The counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were free: Each of migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with undergoing tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
It is two and a half times more than the passing of an official test: The three thousand roubles will become migrant workers.
The main task now is to secure the system against corruption, so workers could simply buy the documents, in the near future agree that government officials and human rights defenders
Government authorities meanwhile can promise that foreign workers who failed tests for the first time, the necessary time to have completed a course of the bases of the Russian language.
For visitors who can't speak Russian, is expected to work in areas that do not require the active negotiations with the people.
The Ministry of the Interior (MVD) does not take into circulation illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD Russia submitted a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
The government's response to the recent events: The stimulus were cases of gunfire at weddings, which was prepared by the absence of the victims, and the massacre Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, whose seven people had died as a result.
The police wanted to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and to raise the age from which we can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee for the security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "tightening of the screws."
The open letter appeared in the network, whose representatives of various social shooting organizations -- the authors -- calling for the rejection of "senseless" tightening of the law.
Percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer, and he said in an interview with the BBC, the Russian newsroom.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior was 142 for six months of the year 2012 committed crimes from the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period, a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The open letter writers are believed to cause the tightening of regulations in the field of civilian arms of the perpetrator, "black" to take over the market.
In their words can be found at the present time in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation is under control, with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From factories after officers
"Black" arms market is supplied by the few channels.
Five is the main channels, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for a decade at the workplace of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of weapons sites that receive orders
The first of them - "military or military path," it means the weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons stole and Russian officers and Kavkazané themselves," says Baraněc.
The other type of "black" weapons are weapons stolen by criminals by the leaders of the security forces.
Baranec explains that they belong here and the theft of weapons stolen directly from the staff of law enforcement authorities and from police warehouses.
"mostly" are coming into the sale of illegal military depots.
In many military stores often leads to explosions.
"It has been established that some of the fires were based on purpose - so as to cover the shortages," says the former soldier.
Its contribution to bring the words Barance and arms manufacturers.
"We currently have private armaments companies, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons to deliver on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black market" is the smuggling.
Separately vending machines as well as a large number of guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's a mafia, which organized their continuous production, and their production, sometimes with weapons produced in small-scale production here," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
The things, what is the approximate percentage of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons experts to the "black" market.
A report on this issue wrote in 2011 center design and analysis of the problems of the public administration.
Specialists dismantled the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian Statistics, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at theme of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, state investigators, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all the arms left on the black market "because officials, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, from 17% of the cases resulted in the theft of weapons in their production of weapons from armed conflicts, in 14%, 5% is "black archaeology."
The salesman-one of the weapons business consultant, who asked not to confuse his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the "black sites" for a long time, no one is buying - archaeologists are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers to drive for the new shipments directly into the military depots.
Despite Ensign buys the candidate's unit, for example, TT pistol.
You have a gun at him and he'll sell it over the fence.
"He takes it into the city and there it sells for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," says.
"The truth is that the police is a good thing in the picture, and therefore whenever they will burn plan in objasněnosti crimes, will control the purchase at retailers with illegal weapons," he adds adviser.
"Like in the luxury market."
With the buyer, the seller often find each other over his familiar.
I visited Web sites and blogs, as long as the guy who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of "Test" appeared, where he will be the man who would lead me into a corner, "where we will act together."
The price of all I learned when there
The military correspondent Victor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, telling the clerk - poradce.- One I knew, but I fully trust him.
Dealers are on the market, but there is also necessary to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to convey that her daughter lost a tooth."
And now I get there through a man whom I am sure.
He is also adds only me because he knows I'll neudám.
Beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when processed article for publication on this topic.
The charts have not changed in his words.
They gave him an album of photos, where there was "all what you think."
"I felt like in the luxury market," the soldier recalled.
The buyer, in the words of the Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke - everything can be tested.
I, a potential client, simply I ain't buyin '- we're going into the woods with the seller, and it will build a target.
"They gave me the opportunity to shoot, and when they see that gun shooting well, we're starting to act," describes the procedure by an expert.
The magazine on the couch
A search engine you bring on the Internet, on the website, as well as the "Vkontaktu" group, where he offers to purchase weapons "for different purposes."
They do not need any documents or face-to-face meetings.
"You have a fixed amount of money," says in the advertisement headline on the website "Buy gun battle or machine."
In these pages users leave their notifications and asking questions.
And sales to minors?
"Of course without a licence," asking the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moskva" - briefly formulates requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently threw a vast network of dummy websites and those who wish to buy a military weapon, is acquiring a shovel.
The people are as hungry fish to the bait and then winning the coal in Siberia.
The military correspondent and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: Web sites are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will pay over the ATM.
"In response to this was the seller sends instructions with a photo and a description of where the weapon was hidden," the "right to gun" tells of a non-governmental organisation spokesperson Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baraněc confirms that after the award of the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and put behind bars.

Makarov for 100 dollars
To pay for the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts' estimates of the amount, usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova from non-governmental organizations the "right to gun" seek a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
Wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon through the temperatures of the stores for long-term storage depots middle section.
According to the official statistical office declined compared with the period of January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of solved cases of extortion and the theft of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US strike fastfoodů personnel and supermarkets
Work on the cash establishments, "McDonald's" through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America, raised a wave of protests against low wages in the company of Wal-Mart hypermarkets and in restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, "" Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" Wendy's "and" Kentucky Fried Chicken. "
So far, no one can predict whether this wave is transformed into a wave of nine, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The trade unions and a number of leftist social organizations support the entire share.
In addition to a modest increase for the salaries they receive rank-and-file workers at Wal-Mart and in fast-food systems, the organizers of the protests aim is to achieve the creation in them in their trade unions.
This economic sector is currently virtually untouched odborářským movement.
46 cents per year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday" when America struck an orgy of cheap sales, was accompanied by millions, and in some cases even brawls.
On this day the company some workers at Wal-Mart, which works in the world of 2.2 million people abandoned their workplaces and demonstrated, together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of the multinationals, chain stores, whose goods is addressed to the people of the poor and middle class.
Wal-Mart sells everything from diapers through hunting rifles and automotive batteries around the world after a vacuum cleaner, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are, on average, about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers in stores Wal-Mart buys only with him at work.
The availability and variety of goods made from a chain of Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics Wal-Mart can afford to sell goods as cheaply partly because few pay their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trucks or small scanners.
The demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical worker Wal-Mart gets $9.5 per hour, but that does not correspond to the height of the expenses, staff members say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Wal-Mart will increase the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is more than the company spends on salaries by an average of 1.1% now.
If the company moves Wal-Mart wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit at the store will be only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers spend about 12,39 dollars more than today.
Walmart's defenders point out that a protest was held only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday," in stores, the company said Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the following day, and during that period the company Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, nearly 100 million transactions carried out in "Black Friday" in its coffers.
A company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with left-focused on the Huffington Post website that posts have left a total of "less than five" of Wal-Mart employees, and that the protest was "the next media sensation," organized by labor unions all told.
"vacant Treasury!"
The protests have continued this week in New York City, where their aim was not trading houses Walmart (you in that pokrokovém town not too far in favor, and therefore there are almost), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says sells billion servings, and then you even paid sick and not properly you for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour for work in accordance with federal law and with the regulations of the State of New York.
Fastfoodové restaurant that wage gradually increase, but only slightly, and, on average, receive their rank-and-file workers in New York City 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this expensive city, no one does not have lower wages.
Well I don't see how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Employment at the "McDonald's" almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter goes after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or planned to stay there for a long time.
At the present time, "McDonald" continues to meet in an interview with the workers, who complain that they must live out of the money, and some of them even to feed their children.
On the other hand hanging on the Wall Street Journal commentary, of which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 in the morning, "McDonald's" at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, on Thursday demanded that cooks and cashiers in fast-food companies began to receive at least $15 an hour, which is more than double their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that the trade unions have been based in the sphere of fast food.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration to punish the activists of the trade union movement of bullying and layoffs, and to prevent the formation of trade unions.
On the other side of their administration rarely makes life easier.
Introduced in fast-food companies, trade unions, however, it is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high employee turnover.
Opposition
On this day were held noisy protests as well as in a number of other low-cost restaurant in Manhattan.
The culmination of that action was a noon rally at the "McDonald's" had emerged near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, in particular, the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's," says sells billion servings, and then you even paid sick and not properly you for your hard work! "
The demonstrators came to aid as well as other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, everyone deserves a New Yorker!"
It was the largest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food, as described by the New York Times.
But only a few hundred people would take part in it, although not all of them were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is so far unclear whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement.
"It's the brain to deceive an average"
Between the fans of modern technology of virtual reality is a popular topic of widespread reality; lately it means to view the world through the prism of special glasses in particular.
At the beginning of the year at its annual conference demonstrated a working model of this news, Google announced in November that Microsoft also filed an application for the patent.
In an interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory Šaramem Izadim shows that for the company's scientists, the glasses are a thing of the past.
The lure is the prospect of the handling of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual of public spaces.
- Tell us please framed, what is your research group?
- Zabýváme with human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on the flat screen, most ever touches the screen with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate a significant change in the interaction.
The Xbox console and the Kinect sensor, for example -- it is a step forward, and almost no Xbox Kinect sensors, because there is a very interesting opportunity for all without gestural management today is not for sale.
- What is still ahead of us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system shifted the interaction on a physical level, very many interactions is still pending on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The larger quantities of data by (system), but output improved the flow of information flow particularly so far.
We're trying to change this, we are working on is really three-dimensional displays systems based on various technologies including projektivních.
It should be admitted into our physical world of the computer world, make him reálnějším.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the users, but also the space around him.
Then we can add to the real world to the virtual objects in much better shape.
And in the first place - to hell with those silly helmets of virtual reality.
- What do you think about the vocal control?
It's a popular thing, but the nepřeceňuje?
- Sure, he cannot be regarded as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places we had such a project in which we think about the gestures, but not about the sweeping, only a very short.
The gesture would nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet to monitor the movements of the muscles and bones.
Yet it is big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, is that the future has mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do I ask, for example, to give you this can of soda?
You say it, and at the same time, show.
I usually just talking.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to identify.
- So you want to get users to adjust to what can or cannot, at the moment the machine?
- It is not necessary at all, but it's mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can detect more precisely the reaction of a man.
It may be a distinction of laser scanners, for example, which provide a relatively good depth, this is very important.
- If you talk about his work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on the modern camera?
Today is not sufficient detail, depth or something else?
- In essence, the current generation - that's what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be a good idea to raise the speed of 1,000 f / 8 megapixels.
But it is not only about the megapixels, but as the depth and nuts.
While the sight of the thing all current technologies are inadequate for us - that the trouble work designers algorithms.
So we have to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the number of frames per second, the speed is also very important.
The move is a dynamic and present the data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made contact sensor with an adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms in length, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, it was very useful in the work of the equivalent of such equipment, but I don't need that much touching, but I need some images per second.
- A increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three "camera," one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and receiver of reflected signal - the second.
And the third camera - that is, in fact, a visible sensor zone.
These are used to determine the depth of the building.
A greater number of cameras would potentially could solve the problem.
Or worsen it, because it would increase the volume needed to be carried out of the calculations.
It would be good to create flexible analog system Kinect, play the curvature of the position of cameras and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional positioning.
- If I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) neprezentoval publicly his glasses.
You don't think in terms of the day-to-day use of the technology of the enlarged reality with the help of the special glasses, is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course walk and constantly keep smatphone in uplifted hands is not very comfortable, but I think, the strongest option would be "portable" version of the spread of reality, which would be based on the platform clouds switch at any time of the smartphone, the projection display and further round glasses.
The glasses - this is a very personal equipment, and in that is their strength (see you), a private matter, and at the same time, as well as weakness - augmented reality on the basis of his glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but also ordinary mortal.
There is one issue on which critics often point: There is no tactile response!
His hand feels nothing!
What answers prepares your group to this challenge?
- In their lectures often say augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between human and machine.
I think it would be complete sensation could become the eighth breakthrough.
Yet one of the interesting tricks - the use of second-hand is used as a kind of a basis for display.
Excellent records depression!
But there are also these technologies, which are really focused on adding the appearance of solidity "picture in the air" - for example, interference few directional ultrasonic beams at the point where the finger is defined, raises the tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you blew on the balls of the feet.
Also available is also a bracelet on his wrist, which affects nerve endings in his fingers -- a promising direction.
-- Have you tried to fool the brain?
What seems to think that he feels it should feel at the moment when they see something?
- It is a good idea, that we haven't tried yet.
There is another challenge that he will fight for a long time - how to get a man who are physically located in a cramped space to believe that an open virtually infinite space walks - are also on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all, such as in clubs), a moving platform, as well as the huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes a goal, it's still work for many years.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things is in the very beginning.
Vkusovština instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avant-garde," dedicated to the citizens who are in the lead, are avantgardou culture and the arts.
At the top of the list were already significant figures graphic scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching Všeruského reputation.
The new Rosbaltu "hero" is stunning designer Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man, who is all dressed in red, which meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, here in the taverns and vernisážích fashion.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is a purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller - it is a striking man St. Petersburg avant-garde end of the 1980s and the early 1990s.
In addition, the city is a man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile on the face of the citizens, all in the mood is increasing.
Recently picked up an organ and became Saint flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with his bohémským life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why you walk around the city all in red and yellow or not, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose the color red as a designer engaged in view and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although as a general rule that everything is just a little different from the gray, incites aggression and stirs bad characteristics.
But my provocations are focused on it, so that the conversation was made.
The whole story of my provocative acts is first and foremost an invitation to debate.
- And when you understand that you have to be an artist?
- On the exhibition at the House of Culture at Něvském, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my path.
Then came a wave of unofficial artists of the old and the new, liberal types of artists, I couldn't understand it.
I was friends with a new wave of artists, with the post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the waves were "puškinské 10," and others.
This brings me to the theater, dressing in all genres of music, except for the words.
- And it all to combine in your art-clinic. - For me it was important to be at the center of the culture of the Petersburg, where should gather all the best forces creativity.
In 1995 I took place on puškinské 10, and there still existed before reconstruction musically-art club, arty club, home petěrburkské Bohemians.
There was much: Nome, tequila Jazz, remember how Šnura the Ears "Van Gogh" was brought to the project.
Be and his friends sang under decking light songs, dressed in tight trikotů, among them in the middle of the composer Igor the dowager's, who is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programmes sworn-galivských times.
We gave them Trachtěnberga, started by his great career, basic education and training received from us.
The gallery "D 137," club "Gribojedov - it is the aftermath of the Art Clinic.
This left our workers and patrons.
I'm a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In the year 2000 was structured survey was in the press, the special prize was "People in our city."
In the nomination, "the Artist of the Year." I was appointed, it ended my peak.
In recent times, according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It is easy to become popular in recent years, but the popularity and the culture are different things today, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.
- Your works are characterized by a recognisable manner.
- Many of my paintings - they are hits, in which is vividly captured the pervasiveness and timeliness.
I have a program of the exhibition "of the Russian Museum in klaunech."
Clowns are timeless categories.
Before I used to be social, today it is painful and awful.
But in the klaunech everything collapses, scanning the tragedy.
I love grotesque, I get the grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian disguised in the regulatory system.
Today, people are under clothing, focusing on the mechanics, not on the inner man.
Or maybe it should be spit in his face and his arm cannot be made.
The trick will be removed and change.
- Recently we have seen you in the role of the urban flašinetáře.- Cultural city should have such a hero.
And who it should be, if not me?
- A commercial art can be beautiful?
- At present their utility, commercial art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
It leads to the collapse of the culture.
Previously, people gathered in groups, Strauss loved one, free from other people.
Today everything was broken at mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not stodolarová bill, I liked all of them.
Today, it should be thinking, whom the zalíbíte.
Today everybody has a cultural hero of 100 fans.
- And on Stasu Mikhailov comes a few thousand spectators!
- On his groupies come, there were sexually involved in the social sphere.
And it comes down to the cultural ground 300 people and 10,000 of them will come, and the consequence is less of the management of the money, all languish.
I can't fool the fans, the main thing is that there is no one and violates what is ingrained.
When I was young, I was painting such pictures hung on the wall along with Falkem and Larionovem at one collector.
I started with the images that people often ends.
Today, people often mistaken concepts.
They say: The consumer culture, the culture minister.
There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I am a man of culture of the previous day, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money because of drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Clive, what is a shortage in Petersburg?
- A good experts on culture.
There is no such concept: The Churchman through the culture.
But not all of them may deal with the culture.
In ordinary times carů that it wasn't in all the Czars understood that the real experts should be encouraged, but perhaps too did not understand the culture.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
For us we have people who could be experts in St. Petersburg, but they are zastrčení somewhere in a corner, because the big experts are needed, who rightly appreciate these experts and state is on the right path.
Today prospers vkusovština.
The Erarta, but differ in that honestly say that not everything we are adopting modern art, there are artists who would have to look for other museums.
- What is your Petěrburk?
- Petěrburk - that's not the main city of culture, the culture is much more in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And on our fallow art are doing poorly.
We need a cultural ground, but for us it is today more than readers, writers, this is wrong.
It's a great many people in Europe, who are curious, who like to go to concerts, exhibitions.
For us, this layer is very weak.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented under the grant funds St.Petěrburku
Born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
The caravan of space ships on board with them on the road, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: How to keep your house in conditions of weightlessness or to the replacement of the planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two of the planet, which is possible to adopt, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute P. K. Šternberga Vladimir Surdin (SAIŠ).
While they are better conditions for life on Mars, but, on the surface of Venus reach temperatures up to 500 degrees Celsius.
Live there is possible only at high altitude or orbiting Venus... in the universe.
Address questions of reproduction in space scientists began with the flora.
Already a half-century ago experiments were carried out on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
The insect was subsequently made into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail's eggs were sent into space, to check how an embryo develops in microgravity.
At the exit of we absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"Vzniká problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start to move," he says, head of the Laboratory Institute biomedicínských problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Syčev.
If they don't find support, the birds chaotically fall and doing somersaults.
After 10 hours occurred at the newly hatched birds to the total demise instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that died in just four days.
"Twice we left turn into birds, but then we rejected it, because it is simply impossible there to work with them," says the failure of an experiment with Vladimir Syčev chickens in the universe.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 experiments will continue.
In "biosatelitu Bion" but will only being one sex.
Conducted experiments with rats who were broadcasting into space already pregnant.
In essence, nothing supernatural discovered there.
"It's just for biosatelitech, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts should be carried out," says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on the floor space rats born offspring.
The approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, so far failed.
It's a tough job.
Animals at the loss of the normal environment simply cannot carry out his sexual instinct.
Unlike the animals, a man may in principle.
Homo sapiens is abstract thinking and is able to make the corresponding emotional backdrop.
For ethical reasons such experiments will be carried out.
But the women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatening Tereshkova's.
The female body is the most precious thing that humanity has.
Our Chaika flew and nobody on Earth could not say whether it would hold a flight into space.
Whether he can do after such a flight to give birth to a child.
"We have no answer to that question," says the veteran of the space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also an astronaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988 he was born the son of a second woman-kosmonautce Savické Svetlana, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts, who were born after long years and growing health descendants.
"And that can be dangerous even when the orbital flights," says the pilot-astronaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia.
Yet humanity must inevitably explore new avenues in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř CPK is a stage of preparation for flight.
Here in zero gravity conditions astronauts embrace the habits necessary to work in an open space.
The water imitating weightlessness.
Though the water is even comfortable for adults, but in its own way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.
Small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a link between that the child is at an average of nine months in his mother's amniotic water and then that is easier to get to the water for them.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing expire only 2 weeks.
"It's very little for a child to have forgotten," says Marina Aksenovová swimming instructor of newborns.
In a nutshell - if it is for a newborn baby weightlessness more natural state, then the inevitable gravity, the attraction is more natural for women.
In the weightlessness occurs very quickly to the pelvic muscles, the abdominal muscles, dropping the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside if they work promoters of muscle activity in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body of the mother should be expelled the fetus.
"And what further?" asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.
On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.
If the organism gravity, the skeleton does not form properly, or a set of muscles.
The newborn into orbit, it is not possible to wear the burden as an adult in a suit in which he could coach.
Just be deprived of what his development needs unconditionally.
"If you go into an experiment, which allows the birth of the child in a foreign environment, bring a disabled person on Earth, which will be completely nepřizpůsobená political environment," predicts the Head of the Commission on Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So having children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But once the time comes when it becomes a reality, and when the Earthlings issue in their ships to a faraway place, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.
The boss of an OWL: Check švarcsystému failed because of politicians'
The Czech Republic has good controllers in connection with public procurement and the quality of the legislation, but in its application is lagging.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz. says that the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what's missing in my view for us," says the current situation, Kala.
Similar conclusions also suggests the joint control of the Czech and German controllers.
As an example of improper practice says Petr Nečas access to a so-called "švarcsystému."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother the trader's controls - is banned or permitted?
"The law must be set in some way, and if something forbids, so neither can prevent the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, under which was compared the legislation on public procurement contracts in both countries.
What exactly was going on?
A parallel check we started about two years ago.
Put simply is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement contracts, followed by the various national legislations and then also the experience itself.
We put all this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, we have shown very interesting differences - generally speaking the legislation is with us, perhaps, "stricter and more sophisticated," the practice itself, however, is better in some parameters in Germany.
This is, therefore, that it is not enough to create more precise rules went on and on, but it is the need to pursue the application of the law itself.
For what you actually can help this project, what follows from him for you?
It is such a common check could contribute to stop efforts to refining laws, the reduction and improved levels, though it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (which is not always the lowest price), in order to avoid the enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the limit of the contracts, it does not necessarily achieve.
It may be that the system is overwhelmed, "the paper" in a quantity that those who wish to find holes in the system, so you will benefit from this much simpler than if the limit was higher.
You're talking about domestic problems with passing legislation on public procurement into practice.
How the control system works in Germany?
Is there an OWL office like ours, or is it otherwise set?
As for the authorities, as well as the OWLs Bundesrechnungshof works, which is organized like us, there is also a college, but they are in some other way, but, in principle, both authorities doing likewise.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal structure, that is to the courts and at the level of the individual Länder - in that the system is a bit different from our own.
BRH can only control of the federal money, we posed by public funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the county, the municipalities with us, they control from the level of the federal courts.
As for the legislation, so it is easier than ours?
In general, I would do it without specific data comparing, however, in some respects, Germany cannot be described as a model, but I'm sure to say that he is better at all.
It is, therefore, perhaps because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it is necessary to say that even countries, which we consider to be a model, faced with a wide range of issues.
If there was any benefit for them to cooperate with our office, isn't it?
As regards the domestic legislation, what the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant to your office, showing the kind of its effects?
Whereas the validity of this amendment is relatively short, so we still in control actions shows.
The ex-post checks because we do, there is a need to count on some delay.
We see it only in the process of preparing the future checks - we started our new tool "inefficiencies risk detection," through which we run almost 14,000 public procurement contracts, and we've analyzed them - there are those changes, of course, will show, because the limits change, the conditions of certain types of the selection procedure shall be adjusted and things like that.
The approval of this law, therefore, is likely to benefit, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope to confirm it.
The problem here may be that she "tighten" the rules, and it will not be possible to follow them.
Already under the previous rules are controlled by the person obliged by the provider (as in the case of the regional operational programmes regional council) to ensure that any failure of the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So the price is tightening the law in this way?
I don't think so in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack him and abuse, and not to punish those who are guilty of formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system would only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how much is out?
Show which way is not the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will not bother entrepreneurs controls the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is banned or permitted?
The law forbids must surely be set in some way, and if anything, then, neither can prevent the Prime Minister in the activities of the Office, which has a duty to monitor and enforce obligations.
It may say: "Změníme that law and we allow it," but you cannot say that we are going to do anything like that.
In the public procurement law are relatively strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is right, in order to protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic, as the candidate with the best bid is excluded for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what's missing in my view for us.
The roads are icy in places, but mostly passable
In a few places in the Czech Republic, the roads are icy and snowy.
But most are passable road somewhere with increased caution.
The Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning, the roads were passable, in some places but also icy and snowy.
The temperature dropped between five to ten degrees below zero during the day's but slightly warm.
Only a thin layer lies in the plains and snow in the region had stopped.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, is around 30 inches of snow.
In some places was even lower visibility due to fog, stems from the data dispatching county got.
R6 expressway and the first-class communications are now passable without restriction in the region.
Caution is, of course, on the spot, for example, on certain přemostěních, where it can be frosty and slippery surface.
All roads are also traveled in the second and third class, including mountain roads.
But on them in some sections lie still remains frozen and places ujetého snow.
Especially in the higher elevations increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubický and Královéhradecký kraj
On certain roads in eastern Bohemia risk may be ice at higher elevations in the mountains on snow-covered roads, the Directorate of roads and motorways report on its website.
The road builders warn the driver before frost can form, especially in the higher elevations of Pardubice Region.
Ice may be in the vicinity Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Shelf, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, in particular, second and third grades on the roads.
They are chemically treated road I / 43 and I / 34 u.
In particular, the snow is on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
Where is the snow in the highest elevations on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia is often clear today when polojasno without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between plus and minus three to one degree Celsius, a light breeze blows.
Plzeňský kraj
V Plzeňském kraji roads are passable, but in places with increased caution in the morning and ride it is necessary to adapt to the weather.
It is in the morning chill, the temperature varies between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and the subsequent slowdown as some communications can be frozen.
In some places, drivers must reckon with the fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
It follows from the information dispatch county got.
The D5 highway was impassable almost without restriction, increased caution, however, recommend the communication between 80 to 131 mile.
The majority has first-class roads vymrzlý and dry surface.
On the Tachov region and the southern Plzeňsku but may be frozen sections.
The second and third-class communications are moist and also in this case is a warning on the frozen sections.
The driver should be cautious mainly on less-traveled roads in the area of the Šumava.
Olomouc Region
The slushy snow on the road today must count on the drivers headed to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sanding remained at Červenohorském saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videlský Cross.
Buried in the field drove in the middle of the night of the snowfall Šumpersku by travel managers nasněžily roughly three inches.
In other parts of the county are the road most traveled without restrictions.
"We Šumpersku lie the remains of the snow in the highest elevations.
The slushy snow on Červenohorském saddle drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník, "the dispatcher told ČTK today šumperské administration of roads.
In the field in the middle of the night they and their colleagues at Jesenicku, road-ae the highest position are now under them naked and wet after the chemical treatment.
Olomouc region on the roads are passable without restrictions on Šternbersku would, however, have the drivers to be careful in forest areas, where the road remained wet.
Ústecký kraj, Liberecký kraj
Several difficult the passable margin jobs reports this morning the road builders in north Bohemia.
But several jobs with the drifted snow or with ledovkou closed and mountain roads of Knínice Telnice at Ústecku, stems from a police database.
The temperature hovers in lower elevations below zero, so ice and snow also appears on the roads vydrží.V lowlands, southeast of Bohemian uplands, in particular, on the other hand, there are no problems and the roads are normally dry.
Operating complications are not yet reported.
The Patagonian reports the road builders, in particular, from the neighborhood Steti.
Under the terms of the meteorologists were ideal conditions in the middle of the night - for her during the day of rain and melting snow, in the middle of the night, clear and cold.
The adverse conditions are reported from major roads and on the road I / 13 on the borders of the Liberec and Ústeckého kraje.
Uzavírku of Knínice Telnice necessitated dented the branches of the trees, which are under the snow, bent to the ground.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the end of the world is to occur in less than a month?
It is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap fun of what we are doing more and we say that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy in order to delay the end of the world, or prevent him.
In December, moreover, convening absolutely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to readers?
It is a national fundraiser, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before December 20 from 21 hours in parallel with three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
End will be around at the time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is about 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone, end Maya calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we were all together with our artist John Augusta.
In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we are also together with the public think about the condition of one of the world we bequeath to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose buying at www.e-tap.cz us humans can also support.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other musicians, also sang a hymn cancelled against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World."
Today is very popular on YouTube, will also be performed on the charity concerts?
Of course, in the very end, so if we can do everything and the end of the world emerges.
All the performers sing it on all three concerts in parallel.
Anthem suddenly links as well as unique live on Czech television.
He wrote the words to the song and plays a leading role in shooting Jesus Tomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X...
How did you get along with them to work together?
We are working as well as with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, whereas we do a lot of charity events and concerts.
We're trying to do is heavily involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.
The proceeds from the concerts will go against the end of the world for what?
The cost of equipment bezbariérového educational centers Studeo, already the sixth year we s občanským sdružením Tap in Jedličkově Institute.
For school students Jedličkova Institute regularly attend teachers and engaged in activities that they enjoy it and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the funds to be released for Teachers themselves, we are allowed to do so in this way.
In the framework of the Constitution Events Jedličkova arises in the future in a separate building, which will move with this project.
At each concert will several musical groups and performers.
How did you pick them?
We have tried to draw up a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague out Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango, Jiří Suchý.
All details will learn to www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May we will prepare for the first time to appear at the Prague Spring, so there must be an interesting programme is interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we're in the US, I would like to link it with a speech in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimal, yet you've climbed in Brussels, London, Madrid or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group comprising disabled people.
How to manage these voyages operationally and logistically?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trucks must travel in the luggage compartment, further along, of course, vláčíme large quantities of cargo and boxes of tools.
However, it was always handled without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us were well prepared, I wondered at times when.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, that was no problem.
Thanks výjezdům abroad can compare how individual vary in bezbariérovosti, public access to reasonably priced applications and the like.
With what you have not yet met?
After London, Luxembourg, Madrid and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the east, everything is still in the complete starts.
In Prague, Moscow is very barrier, there is still unusual for a man in an electric wheelchair himself was at the center of the city.
Is there even such commonplaces like that should be wheelchair give priority in the elevator.
Fortunately there even have a civic association, which is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There's a lot of things, in which we are still lagging behind.
But it is important to mention that upgrades and improvements in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London, in Madrid, it is quite normal that even people with severe achievement of self are in public, they can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere.
But it is very normal that there would not be a large number of people with disabilities actively participated in social life, in that we, on the other hand, with a little bit of The Tap Tap ahead!
The respect of the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when we are prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change the real thing.
Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but a few years back what made you in 1998 to begin her?
I climbed into the Jedličkova Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who had an interest in something like a tutor to pay.
And since I'm a musician himself, playing the saxophone, among others, so I, together with my colleague founded extracurricular musical circle.
And with the passage of time will tell us, as our host Láďa Angelovič says, a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came up in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we began to connect with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
It occurred to us that work, which is not seen as if in fact did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union can afford high-quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Your goal was to go to The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning I felt the potential of the fact that we can do something different.
Showbusiness's crowded things where one imitating the other.
It is, in a way, logical, all new is taken up by carefully, and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that the Tap Tap are one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, is, of course, regret, it is only natural.
But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with no achievement in all the lonely beings that we must regret.
These are the people who can live a full life, and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if something happens to people with achievement, so it is not only a shift for them, but for society as a whole.
It will also help this success, you are a hard taskmaster, how many people call you?
If we want to do a good job, we must be uncompromising in many cases, and require some discipline.
I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when they find that they must go to the test twice a week, attend the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm is so quickly leave.
This is how it works everywhere, in every group, which wants to work and that he wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We open the group, people come and go, you can't avoid it.
Who has the will and appetite, has always been an open door for us
Place the day before the end of the world, is expected on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.

Poland and the cosmos.
In the past week was adopted at a meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency in Poland for the twentieth of a member of the European Space Agency, as the other countries of the former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which will become a full member of the ESA 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched a close working relationship with the ESA in 1994, and over the years have been involved in a number of the projects of the agency.
But Poland's path to space began much earlier.
The number of flights into space devoted to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War, but not always met with understanding.
Recall, for example, a lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which represented the thoughts of his pioneering work on December 6, 1933 Entry into space.
The idea of a young engineer (b) 1905) left audiences cold and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld in 1934 won for Entry into space in France worth of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and Andre Louis Hirscha.
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and space.
He wrote a number of books and hundreds of articles published in Polish magazines devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world-known promoter of spaceflight and his contribution was valued by the fact that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
Already rolling trolley, which should be equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland in 1925.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known, and even the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for the ground trolley or to its application.
Information about the handcar are known only from dobového press.
Since 1933, the rocket shells began to deal with the Polish artillery.
The research was Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
Of the surviving materials, it is clear that the research came to the stage prakzických tests.
But the research was interrupted by the arrival of German troops.
In 1937 proposal appeared in specialized printing photovoltaic interceptor missiles, which suggested the engineer Rohoziński and came out in the following year work Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author Leliwy-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects devoted to military use of rocket technology Temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) to coordinate all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but the start of the war ended after two years of its business activities.
Further work is dedicated to space after the war, thanks to the work of the company's astronaut of Poland (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) are appearing in the Polish press.
For the first time the company is mentioned in the November edition vintage 1954 problemy magazine, in which four more comprehensive sections are devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, is designed to create a society that will deal with the space.
At that time was running projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising field.
Since the beginning of the year 1956 the Polish company astronautická (PTA) snažia astronaut to join the International Federation (1951) and already established in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, with the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became vice-president of the International Federation of astronaut.
This function held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA contributed significantly to the development of a very successful weather rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket that carried out by scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with were able to reach 1,800 meters was about 80 cm long, and it weighs less than 5 kilograms.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and flight tests of two instances in the Bledovské desert RM-2 rockets have been launched in the summer of 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 inches long, and it weighs about 11.5 kg.
Another development type already should be capable of real scientific work - a rocket RM-34 should be available to 14.5 km and its mission was the height of the wind.
But the further development was suspended in 1962.
The Heir missile Meteor-1 became the first rockets of the type of RM developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a double, its overall length was 510 cm and takeoff weight was 32.5 kg.
The size of the space for scientific instruments were developed three types of (marked "Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that was different.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space on the volume of 0.4 liter, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 took place in the development of missile Meteor-2, Leteckém Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor missile-2 was starting weight 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-3 and Meteor-2H were built.
There is still a need to mention Poland's entry into the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the framework of the programme Intercosmos engaged in space research on Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second after Vladimir Remek interkosmonautem.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
In the past week the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution has sparked a lively debate in public.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world, they are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems are in permanent conflict between them.
The cause is the principle of free trade and unrestrained, free movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the considerable differences prices work (wage) leads to the tension.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition that "trip" price competitor with the aim of tearing down to shoulder a greater share of the market and thus to increase their profits.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or they buy cheaply, or zaniknout.Výsledkem is high unemployment in the countries where labor costs are high in comparison with other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, and thus the responsibility for it produced unemployment, rising social spending in the state.
The situation underscores the reluctance of businesses to pay taxes and that economic and social society of the damage that was done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to specify the particular statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies will create a situation where governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce social level of their own populations with the aim to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the government's private equity risk his own population regardless of social decline.
It is primarily manifested in amendments to existing laws.
The goal is the force of its own population adopted the diktat of private capital, particularly in the areas of wages.
This is happening, on the other hand, a set of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand, limiting the rights of workers in the field of employment law.
The result is growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years of public lander of food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that, properly employed people receive a salary that the state must pay them into the breadline.
That scandal was published in the case of auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures virtually all of southern EU states clearly lead to the same situation, in which people are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of the social level forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or scrape for starvation wages on the fringes of society into the country in the hope that he might someday private investment capital.
Here is necessary, but ask where it comes?
If it will be from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or a Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the wages of Europe.
That applies to the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theory and media ad nauseam contends that the state cannot attend to its own economy, capital-that-driven economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly insists on the opinion that the state should not interfere with the management interventions in the economy.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private equity does not intervene, now, in fact, be governed by the politics and that the entire state in their own egoistickém sense.
Here is a clear-cut answer yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation as reflected in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefit, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department for the lack of financial means private law firms outsource the drafting of laws, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All this power comes from the people as they preach the constitution of the western type, but of the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation as it describes Appiános in his work of the Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "Stop the obsazovaly of violence was in full decay and the authorities for a long time.
For bribes, illegal acquisition of affection and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any inhibitions and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice... "" men of character to the office at all neucházeli, so once was as a result of the breakdown was the state eight months without consuls "...." It is, indeed, to talk about the fact that the only cure is in a bad situation samovláda and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man.. "Appiános while thinking Pompeia, but it became Caesar, who changed to take democracy for tyranny.
Conclusion Like in antice reckless preference of contemporary society is based on its own interests without regard to society's interest.
Private capital is not inherently able to understand and to society's benefit.
Now, as then, is the result of unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform a deeper flavor.
Causality boarding fascist and communist regimes we must therefore found in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation the demise of these systems in favour of the type of liberal democracy can be regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.
The fact that the current elite is particularly disastrous completely ignored in the future be statisícové casualties, humanitarian and social disaster, which we've already witnessed with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of the competition on both international and Interior European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to find ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms that will strengthen the state capital participation in the economy will strengthen the influence of citizens in the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favor of the state.
Israel: A laboratory of chaos.
"The violence can never be" Sting and could not work in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "let us not forget how fragile we are."
"If the war would want my sons, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife Amschela Mayer Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip is, as always, thrown a lot of reaction.
Some argue his right to self-defense, stands by Israel and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists and other support the Palestinians argue racism of the Israeli state, the genocide inflicted on the state of Israel and the Palestinian Arabs fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to wonder who is in periodically recurring waves of killing the culprit and the victim who, after all, the people of Israel today, including self-governing territories were born into the current political situation and the beginning of the violence seen.
The fact of the matter to offer readers look behind the curtain to look at it, who primarily serves for 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the country in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are backed up by historical facts available some are derived from them on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is a history of the struggle for power in the first place.
In every era can be traced some of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether it has always been the personalities, which completely autonomously governed by their actions, or whether someone who stood behind the throne of directing their actions to advance vytýčenému goal.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world is zkoncentrováno wealth in the hands of a few and that this concentration of money and power resulting from them could occur in the life of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families out of one, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I) - Rothschieldové, but I don't know if anyone is still standing over them.
He writes about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought back in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop associating their names with highly criminal deeds, stood in the background, and that's always meant the consolidation of power, the proliferation of wealth or both.
With shares in almost all of the world's central banks and against countries where they don't have shares in the central bank's lead or preparing a war (against an attack in Afghanistan was that it was 5-7 countries, after invading Iraq, countries, only four remained after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but in the meantime, Russia had been subordinated to the central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln Rothschieldově refused to renew the status of the central bank, Bank of America, began to issue government (translated) of his own money during the civil war and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed 1963, an MP, was assassinated in 1936, Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned after he wanted to sue FED for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for a global power led to the formulation of the plan in three world wars of the 33rd degree, a Mason from 1859-1871 insiders Albert Pike.
The first war should be to remove large monarchistické public facilities in Europe, the second was removing the colonial mansion in Great Britain and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a large number of slaves for their comfort and luxury enough and do not consume too many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a final takeover of absolute power and fertile ground for such a solution).
The method, which the group of the richest families in the lead with Rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and subsequent offering solutions (order ab chaos - order out of the chaos).
But these solutions are false and lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, in order to avoid a crisis like the one created in 1907).
So after managed an assassination imperial heir to the throne of R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the First World War, destroyed tsarist Russia launch the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended sudden, militarily and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (no longer need a war for the destruction of Czarist Russia), and subsequently led to the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the emergence of World War II left bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation that imposed on Germany's huge war reparations, which had created the radicalization of the impoverished masses and then they just slip sufficiently strong to the Germans, identifying the culprits and simple solutions offering Leader and the creation of multi-ethnicity in Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should play as fifth columnists and played too, sparking a fire.
At the end of the 19th century prompted Rothschieldové preferential in the historic area of Judea, the founding of the Zionist movement, of which one branch to seek the creation of the Jewish state with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
Already mentioned Balfourova Declaration has created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, if Hitler was plucked from the chain, which it initially held international bankers, or what was in the plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camp has created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and was just as war reparations Germany to invite the 2.světovou war, the declaration of the state of Israel was created an outbreak of war in the third.
If it can unleash international bankers, the Jewish nation, like the other, of the victims will be in the front line of the fighting, now jointly with an Arab or a Muslim population of the Middle East in general.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only within the country, but also on an international scale (consider just how sharply divided the people of Israel's supporters and opponents.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence when he stood at the beginning of all the greed of individuals and their desire for a global power?
There is a need to make a distinction between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because people like us, international bankers peddled only candidates of their own choice in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example fašizujícího, loyal to international bankers, a politician who makes every effort to trigger a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict and given control over Iran moving through the strait, which travels 20% of all of the world's oil (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In light of what is now appears to be the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and the people will agree to a new world order."
A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
The rest of the world, where the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The rest of the world, where everyone is newly born individuals implanted in the birth of the chip, which makes of him being totally controlled.
"What makes all large and small, rich and poor, free and slave labor, so that they have the right hand or forehead brand, so that it cannot buy or sell, who is not identified in the name of the beast or with her name.
It is necessary to understand: Who has the sense to combine the digits of the beast.
That number indicates a man, and that number is hundred sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When is the hardest to call Hollywood
Captured the crowd demonstrating of Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 diplomats hostage.
Should be released in exchange for the ousted the Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the Revolution, which were patron of his regime for several decades.
The situation for the US administration offered a positive outcome - throw the Shah overboard would so fundamentally threaten confidence among the allies in other countries, because she could not afford.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, but has been unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened fiasco attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detention of the diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their plight triggered a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed considerably to Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film režírujícího actor Ben Affleck, Argo describes an episode in the history of America, which brought a small victory.
Just prior to the occupation of the embassy have fled her six employees.
After a complex business ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get them from Iran, helped so extravagant a cover story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who surveyed the location for the filming of the country's sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the "expert exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to be credible, the legend said the film project in the specialist magazine, held a press conference, a production company she had a real office.
The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez, a long period of time, the details of the operation were classified.
Affleck film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time, the so-called 'right movie, "the story of the height of the piece, scam - can be seen as an example of a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film's change of mood - on the one hand dokumentárně designed sequence from Tehran (in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photographs of the events and the way in which the same situation were mentioned in the film - big differences in that they are not).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, covered with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -muži in suits analyses of the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone.
Ben Affleckovi is remarkable in the way managed to restart his career.
The actor had become an object of mockery became a respected director, as well as his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comment.
ARGO is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film, which is happening here in Boston, režisérově home.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place where he was among the characteristics that warned older films place above Hollywood standard.
Affleck and it is also reflected in the Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the movie is taking place in the streets, when rekonstruování actual events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, who also conveys the emotion of the confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that ensue when history to move somewhere out of the blue.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes contrived (a false staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many things in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that he has told the story does not offer much in the film sense erratic scenes.
Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to reality, something přimyslí - there everything so elegantly based (a scene in which a potential crisis at Tehran airport will call in America and chase after the runway is pretty far-fetched).
Weakness Argo's restlessness arising from the need to show too many things in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood collaborators are very charming, but their characters would have meant more space and nearly all are not in this movie.
Affleck movie sort of losing a dramatic move, it's a picture, which can be monitored with mild interest, to evaluate the implementation of the retro style evocative thrillers of the 1970s.
Swings but only barely.
As a reminder of one so far in a certain way of living history as well as proof of how the images of suffering and vševědoucích exaggerated the intelligence service, but will suffice.
Rules for bananas, inflating balloons, and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year publishes polled on the absurd banking fee, has now decided to declare the competition for "absurd regulations or ideas from the workshop of the EU."
"Vedla us for this latest incident, when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women in the leadership of the great European companies," he told Právo survey organizer Patrick Nacher.
Among the nominated absurditami's, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of unification of premium rates for men and women.
Yet, at the same time, the women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are less risky for insurance companies in an objective manner.
"Other people can nominate incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations include even mandatory blending biofuels into the fuel, which harm as a result of the directive on the size or nature, as well as a ban on the use of solid mercury thermometers, just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, hens cage, for which this year significantly more expensive eggs.
Criticism also faced earlier de facto ban on the use of the expression pomazánkové butter or phase out the sale of incandescent bulbs.
High-quality bananas have 14 inches
The EU's camera often sits under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobbies, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech Republic, now, as well as the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks.
The lobby interests were also behind this, that bananas, for example, had the highest quality in the Union to achieve at least 14 cm in length and allowed show "anomalous twist."
The European Commission, meanwhile, said that only harmonises the uniform national standards, which complicate trading.
EU rules on fruit and vegetables over the opposition of some states softened with reference to the fact that the existing Directive lead to food waste.
May also be a candidate for the victory in a survey last year by the EU regulation, under which it must be a warning that children younger than 8 years is not obligatory for sold balloons inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appeal to the U.S. research, according to which the balloons are among the leading causes of death in children's toys to suffocation.
Similar restrictions are now set for children under the age of 14 when foukání carny frkaček.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule is quite absurd relating to the European officials themselves - anyone who has any official position in the EU, not with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece must talk instead about Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated in polls, in addition to some of the above absurdities, even on the territory of a Member State EU regulations on the volume of food stocks.
The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, set the volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he threatened a high penalty.
The organisers polls taken as well as the idea of some countries to pay for it, that they do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies on a request to obtain subsidies.
However, these ideas emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We handicapováni that we don't have the sea.
Ask for reimbursement from the European Union, "he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument stated that we had bred a lot of grain and as a result of the so-called intervention buying had become filled with stores, which had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic has continued to ports, EU had us under Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out to meet the Czech Republic by a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to obtain subsidies offered to municipalities controlled the Ministry for Local Development Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), namely, should go to write applications for the subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
The efficient functioning of the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time, the regulation is not easy to become a target of criticism in the Member States and the development of the entire European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
The major problem is according to the experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies to projects that are not even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations that will force the Member States.
Emotions among Czechs raises that like other countries of the European Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to specific indications of their traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this fight.
The Czechs had after šestiletém to fight with the Germans and Austrians strike marking Olomouc cheese, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the tuzemák.
Only products made from cane distillate may bear the name of rum, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company internationally renowned German Lübeck marzipan, Gorgonzola and feta cheese or Parma ham biscuits, Karlovy Vary, for example, were already Pohořelický and Třeboňský kapr Žatecký chmel, too.
The EU trademark then can also boast Pardubice gingerbread and hořické tubes.
People want to save the republic, but I am an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how a man thinks that he wants to run for president?
I don't care about it, to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so anywhere nekandiduji.
But I can't watch the past twenty years the country rozkrádá, as thieves run here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, so I try to come up with a solution, how to change it.
And since I am independent and was forty nestraník, I don't have any choice, how things affect than to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but then you started at the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I said that I go into battle on the Castle depending on the outcome in congressional elections.
Later, I said that if I'm elected senator, I'm going to run for president.
But my aim is not function, function is an instrument, how can I carry out their vision.
Therefore I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not just that as a nation at in the pub and in front of the TV, but that the trampling of anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to that the media that a man dehonestují and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For me to be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the battle of the Castle were charged with criminal liability and substantive propositions of politicians and reversing the property return over twenty million.
For that you need to change the law.
As president but don't have the authority to do that, but the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How's it going to solve?
When I lobbied for it as a citizen, to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it through.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, deliberately rejected, and people's lives.
As an independent nestraník got much greater potential to win the support from all the parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without partisan categorization and dogmas can take something from each party, what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more as a man of the right-wing, or a left-wing?
From the Czech perspective it seems to me that people enjoy me more to the left.
For me it is not important at all, if a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
I don't care about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
Always support any public good solutions, though he says of the Communist Party, or ODS, as well as going against a bad idea.
Čertíte is, if someone tells you that you are a populist.
But you that what you said?
When you byznysplán in the company, as well as you have a vision and an ideal target.
And to do that you're trying to approach.
Anyone can call it populism, but all the proposals, I'm talking about, already leading experts in the world of work or talked about them.
But without the support of Parliament, you were just slogans.
And with that, in the long-term policy nevystačíte.
Or do you think when you're for people to walk and talk with them, you'll be able to push through the material and criminal responsibility, for example?
I don't have any other choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and members of the public and try to get them on your side, to promote it.
I was elected president, is not a problem to organise a live broadcast television, where he is chairman of the parliamentary parties, to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they don't want it.
If there's a strong personality, which will be naming abuses, can push on the political scene.
Take direct election of the president, it was the work of public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I am not a genius, not an intellectual.
For his views and visions trying to seek allies.
In politics, I had only just begun and will try to gain majority support for his program.
The things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, I'm done in six years and I will return to the private sector.
It sounds like the Czech Republic should save Okamura.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I don't do anything in one person, because I'm around a number of famous people, whether they are also candidates for the Senate.
Because of the amount of work that went beyond the Radimem Jančurou refused.
So I supported at least an investigative journalist Jan Lorencovou which rozkrývala fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but I am now in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who were mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independents in the Senate.
People navolili Senate so that it will be difficult to enforce the changes.
But I'm going to fight for your vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors or generals.
You're considering establishing his own party?
I thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past each potential straníka, and neither don't have the money for it.
I have no money even for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property returns, what is it yours?
Private property estimate about 60 million.
In Prague got land about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art about ten million, Aston Martin for $3.5 million and Skoda Superb per million and then I got a couple of million in the account.
Aston Martin by the way I have because it was my boyish dream - always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was courteous to women and, at the same time, he fought against the wrongs and faults.
You got the property for $60 million, Aston Martin and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to amend the Republic, but you don't want to give too much of their own money into.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
To get into debt?
I bumped into the campaign had 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors indicates that on my program might not be such an interest.
And I don't have an obligation to pay a campaign of their own.
The cost of the campaign to cover me basically what I receive senátorský salary.
But from him I nevyžil, for example, I could not pay for the son of an English school, which cost 30,000 per month.
I just wanted to make money, so anywhere nekandiduji.
So you will remain in business, so you can live?
You said that these activities utlumíte?
But that has nothing to do with the level of salary.
As I promised, I partially canceled their activities.
For example, the travel agent to become my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be the Good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need to earn a living.
How many of you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which take on.
And if I were president, I would put an end to their business.
You can find the full interview in the Saturday edition of The rights.
The architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure are only in his head - for example Spijkenisse and recently built a mountain of books -- 2 photos
"The building looks futuristic seems cheerful. Finally is once again to see something interesting," says Verhaig Lisette, who goes around on the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician in nearby a large firm, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
I will, however, ask what we still need a library.
They all have the Internet, iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody goes, or is it?
Spijkenisse, settlements in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, that's not worth a visit, is holding a special record.
This town with a population of 80 000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this silly situation, died a few years before the decision to contribute to the universal education and build seven nicely painted miniatures of fictional bridges, reinforced concrete, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was less than glowing.
And so city councilmen recognized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: We've got to have a library.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master insanely courageous sloupcových graphs and the contractor humorous, often even cynical buildings, accepted the case with his usual calm and appeared on the competitive negotiations in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still stunned looked around and shrugged her shoulders, piling brash Maas their gifts to each other by size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear urban city!"
This is my proposal on the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, she was piled a mountain for 30 million euros.
The post office is revitalizačního parts of the project, which also include the underground parking lot, a supermarket, and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November was the mountain of books vyznamenána second place "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for an award the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Maloměstská gray, who still could not offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly at the town hall, for which the white facade would rather than expected dairy, is a bit richer as a result of contemporary architecture.
, in particular, has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long journey to the book
First impressions: Reading rock and roll under the hatch on the cheese.
Although a mountain massif rides the elevator, but the actual space and you discover reading passion when pedestrian control topography.
From all sides with the interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burning kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see the dog, park benches and the boys and girls who play soccer.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally standing shelves with books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark room, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classical spatial configuration upside down, and the space for the reader, we ran from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: Offices are located in the center of the Internet, the library, the chess club, organic and center operator front techniques.
Special comfort are black shelves for books that were once lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure, and the stench is strange.
Over an unknown building material shake their heads even avowed architects and engineers.
"We have to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager for the city's municipality Spijkenisse, to question Standard magazine.
And so we are in one fríském farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.
For many years the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands is used as a basis under the roots of a millimetre fleece of synthetic material.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
A thin textiles last one or two of the season and he is ready to trash into bulky waste.
For the library was fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - slisováno on board about four inches thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (be) stain in the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material, which smells a bit like a new car and a little bit like sports shoes.
After 105 go to the top of the stairs.
At the end of a long journey of nearly 500 meters you will be rewarded not only the fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and ficus trees in pots in a literary cafe.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly on the proper humidity in the mountains of literature.
Donations for the new soul
"I guess you wouldn't believe, but this house is a case in the project despite many areas of glass, in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
The heating and cooling the Earth's heat.
Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun shines in only a short time, and even on sunny days.
Broad improved wooden trusses, which stands at right angles to a glass facade, serves as a shading and picks up a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine to Cynthia Bogarde Boekenberg even referred to as "the long-awaited" Spijkenisse soul.
The reason: Each of the population of the city a few weeks before he was invited to the opening that gave a book from his personal funds.
Should that be filled first optical gaps not yet fully equipped with a library, currently numbering 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proved its worth.
The shelves are quite crowded.
"There's nothing worse than a half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think now, thanks to our invitation has each of the inhabitants of a relationship to a new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for show.
The MVRDV worked in the royal discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse said the history of literature.
Whatever is young and uneducated.
It is, in the end, the starting point for an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the decision-making process for the admission of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen Szaboa by Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle, Germany at the beginning of the week at first suggested that the Palestinians would have voted against the proposal for observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be prudent in Germany because of their special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think, will not support nor the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, of course, it was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.
The last champion of NATO.
It's difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that's the way it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, and German foreign policy towards the direction of policy, which was controlled by the US, so to speak.
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are therefore between the two lines.
From there, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but are not used to it.
I think of is just settling in its role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.
On foreign policy, as they are in France or in Great Britain.
What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It shows a readiness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think, German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, therefore, exports and his relationships with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other major powers and, therefore, Germany must protect its interests.
To have an impact on the position of the economic interests in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
Germany is the first major outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful to discourage the public, but even the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
I wouldn't want to do that but not to attach too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
However, it plays an important role in the German considerations in any case.
Damage Germany's relations with the US, when Germany abstained in the case of the two important decisions, for example, during the vote on Palestine?
I think that there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as a breakthrough on the issue of Libya.
Perhaps out of Germany even get some respect.
It signals that it must be regarded as an international player, and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian Initiative.
The US, by contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.
There are differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic politics.
I think that the Obama administration has probably had a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there cannot hold this position, of course, to the public.
I think the difference of opinion is not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, that Obama isn't too excited Netanjahuovou policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to harmonise their close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other hand,?
I think this just makes it to the Germans.
For the Germans, it would be a little easier, of course, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
They cannot be part of a wider line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.
That's what they were doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will push Europe to the European position and take a leading role in the future.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I don't think that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as an important international player? He wants to take the lead role?
Or is a leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still used to it, it's still uncomfortable, and it is still difficult for obvious reasons for this country to play a greater role.
If, for example, let's look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, gives protiněmecké mood.
It will facilitate the Germans.
It is, in fact, the old problem: We don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of views and its neighbors, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics now continues to decline, but the EU currently be this vacuum. Who's left otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they feel uncomfortable and makes it even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"Protecting brands" in China: When Armani and Puma are suddenly Chinese
Polo Ralph Lauren, Armani is the world-famous brand as well.
But what is the Armani Polo?
Behind it lurks the designation, which is quite officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original firm.
Enjoy protection for so long, however, until it is nezažalují real brand owners.
And even then it is not clear whether to amass the rights.
"It's increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.
A new case each week lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters is already a few extra letters, so that they can make their own brands.
Lu-will thus become the Gucci Gucci and Prada instead they register Prada-kny.
In this way they are legally copied and German firms, like sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet, the records of the trademark office in Beijing.
14 September 2010 had left one Chinese company to protect brand Zegna DF Puma robot project, which parazituje as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the universe in copying and intellectual property violations.
In large cities are multistory department stores in which almost exclusively selling fakes.
But Pattlochovy cases are different. Under the authority of their principals' is totally opposed to Chinese firms received from the trademark office officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," the Associated mark.
The word "Dakuan focuses on" Bang.
That means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.
"Poškozuje this trade, we must fight it," Pattloch calls.
"Call to dilute the exclusive status would disappear, the damage to the image is enormous."
The court costs of the affected industries, and financial losses running into the millions, particularly for expensive product demonstration.
According to data from market research company for the CLSA China with the volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market for luxury goods and market that is growing as quickly as possible.
The deletion of dubious records in the record labels can be difficult to achieve, and it is something.
The procedure can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected claims that the contested name became a reality of the market "after a long period of time."
If the plaintiff has bad luck plagiátorovi still must pay because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases relate to the graphic elements as well.
In 2009 the Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a firm, which recently took over the German manufacturer Putzmeister pumps on the concrete mixture.
As a result, the Chinese still can use the emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The company Geely bought Volvo, which was originally used blue and white logo that looked like BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely logo had to change.
The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.
While the CTMO známkový Office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of too much of a small number of staff and premises.
But in the last year, reportedly said, "the operation of the labour force returned from an emergency situation to normal."
The number of unprocessed management of objections, for example, dropped by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints on the settlement.
To do something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, it's impressive numbers.
In the last year was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than the year 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind leads the list of new applications in the world.
It also applies to the number of all existing trade marks - a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011 was on the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that each filing in the average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Start against this dispute is several times as the German case shows the family business Freudenberg.
The group has been fighting for more than seven years against Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had reached that was cancelled his illegal manufacture imitovaných automotive components.
But the forger had secured the rights to the brand Freudenberg continue.
We're neglecting it, because in Germany cannot be protected surname, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management company Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
Známkový office CTMO then, too, a Munich company rejected.
In the other two arenas are Freudenberg obtain the rights, but the defendant in the dispute is also fighting to this day.
We need to be very careful
It is now a matter pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has the confidence that he would take the case to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "Management is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs cannot be measured in the archives of the company had even over a hundred years old files to produce evidence.
Five years before the company Freudenberg counterparty vainly offered "high six-figure in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"From this, you see, what it means for us," says Wentzler.
It threatens to hit the danger from the Far East and Europe.
And if it's there, imitators will ensure the unprotected brands.
For example, one Chinese producer wanted to make in Germany Freudenberg designation for footwear and leather.
This area of the business activities of the group long ago gave up, yet he was able to avert the registration.
"We need to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and a lawyer Pattloch advises German enterprises, to be very careful in its dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international rights známková. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is in any way to protect themselves even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the company compete in the last act of the drama of the brand to, then I think the opposing party will have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World Aids Day: Singing, stomping, aid
Tests in Heidelberg College Imbongi - and in Swaziland have the joy out of it after his parents, who died of AIDS orphans.
The story of the merger, which is much more than a 8733 kilometers.
First is the stomping: Basketball shoes, cowboy boots, moccasins looking for the men's and women's shoes on the dance floor tact and quickly found him.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly swell the voices of the singers - bass, alto, tenor and soprano - insist, extorting and mutually punishable.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it nearly lifts from its textile shoes when he connects voices its voluptuously wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music room of the Institute of medical psychology tests in Heidelberg College Imbongi a new song.
It came to a fifty-band and singers from human genetics researcher between 23 and 69 years after the porter.
"Om" Obani "is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and still speak a foreign language - Zulu eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in parts.
Aid to the self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that there are some 34 million people around the world who are infected with the HIV virus.
From this 23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Swaziland's 245 000 orphans from his parents, who had died of AIDS.
Already more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 orphaned after parents, who died of AIDS, in the village Esitjeni found group Voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
More than 70 of them attending school in the second instance.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take over patronage.
Guarantees for the child of school fees, a school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "or even" in the Zulu language "a storyteller who extols."
Fluent bantuštinou can't talk to anybody in this space, I just sing.
For almost ten years exercises a chorus of the song in this strange soft speech and sometimes is also brings back where it originally came from: To South Africa.
In the great circle distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is, in fact, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the bulk of the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some of them still in simple mud and straw huts. A large portion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have parents, as they succumbed to the AIDS virus.
In Esitjeni can be seen in small, became ill in Swaziland, the highest rate infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision penile demonstrably, which reduces the risk of the disease by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity in me. It is not uncommon that die in less than thirty years.
This village discovered a chorus on the joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. But primarily Imbongi members saw many children in the streets, which was not only parental custody, but absolutely everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without ending school education have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros per year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But already a year later it was based chorus society "Voices for Africa," who took care of orphans of parents who have died of AIDS since then, almost professionally.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
Who are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI has syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral failed are HIV, herpes, human special glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies belongs to parazitárním failed.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are especially among men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases, which were reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contacts between the men.
With heterosexual adults were sexually transmitted diseases, which occur frequently, chlamydiové infection, trichomonády, kandidóza (mold), gonorrhea and human special.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults with us extended relatively few, but this group accounted for about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV.
Among juveniles are chlamydiové infections occur much more often than other groups.
According to the European polls with three quarters of all infections involving young people from 15 to 25 years old.
For us, the extra special human often occur among juveniles.
As the number of infections has developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infections syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 disease in 2001 at 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been shrinking since 2007.
The year 2011 was approximately 700 cases.
It is about one-tenth of less than a year before.
What the signs point to a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause difficulties in urination, spotting, pain in the abdomen and warts and pimples, boils in the groin area.
Often, however, don't cause any pain or other symptoms, and will therefore nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of the disease, but it offers 100 percent protection.
Because the perpetrator may partly be transmitted sexually transmitted diseases and infections from impurities and close physical contact.
So experts recommend, particularly in the event of frequent rotation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible cure most failed and prevent the subsequent consequences.
Due to the patronage, charitable gifts and last but not least honorářům, which earns a choir singing throughout Germany, gather some money.
"We have to Esitjeni sent roughly 200 000 euros," says league Chairwoman Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany holds in the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman can impose.
Looking also to orphaned children found shelter, for example, some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as they say in the Zulu language, old women are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have even 14 orphans, taking care of the kids and give them a roof over your head at every day in a timely manner in uniforms to school.
Children who no longer have to go to a shelter Khanyisile, the lone woman of the bunch, as well as two of the cooks who cooked on a daily basis for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" also established a school sewing, put the two together with the American health organizations and chicken coops DOGS arranged that have left many people in the village do HIV test.
This is not granted. Even when the disease is so evident in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
The King's 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."
As a matter of fact rather strange in a country where the king had officially maintains 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
The state approved a way of life is, among other things, also blamed on the fact that the HIV virus had spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But even many of the migrant workers who took the virus in the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is being used.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse. "
At least a little bit to promote cultural exchange, travels the choir Imbongi once every two, three years after South Africa together and singing songs full of grief, militancy, self-esteem and confidence in the future of black, known to many in the southern tip of the black continent yet from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks - such awards not only brings humor and joy, but also has already sparked tears for many wild border troops.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where children visit the singers, over which they have patronage.
Although hardly find this village on the maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.
"Go into Esitjeni, there is light," says the people there.
And when you get back to Heidelberg, who is here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers, to dupajícím the singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines even here.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury ice
The Messenger probe found evidence that the ice is on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aeronautics Office of the ordinary (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even when it is closest to the Sun, there's also frozen water, as results of the three studies, which on Thursday published a magazine "Science."
The Messenger probe found evidence for that in the area of this planet, which lies in the shadow, there is a blanket of ice.
She is reportedly at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 feet thick.
The water came from comets or, perhaps, of an asteroid that slammed into Mercury.
Nedávejme but hit the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, "said Sean Solomon, head of the scientists working on the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can earn up to 426 degrees Fahrenheit.
The findings could help us, however, to explain how they got the water and other basic elements of life in other areas of the solar system.
The probe, the little robots and telescopes like Phoenix, nepozorovaní Earthlings, participate in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time send pictures to Earth, a small window into the emptiness.
The picture comes from the photographic apparatus, developed by German scientists from the Institute of Max Planck Institute.

One of the biggest and most incisive pictures Hubble telescope: Swirl of the galaxy
Photos spiral galaxies, according to its colouring become real works of art.
The shot, which published the European Southern Observatory, depicts a few thousand light-years distant nebula each frequency grouping in the constellation of Sagittarius.

Our eyes in space: The most important telescopes
The telescope allegedly invented in 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to watch the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew - and looks to broker, are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was over a period of 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this figure had a diameter of five meters.
Standing in the US Arizona Large Binocular Telescope.
Provides a glimpse into space by now two of the mirrors, each of which has an average 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. But the mirror is measured by 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, plans to costs.
Still, its diameter is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of cheap fashion design: The telescope is secured hákovadlem in výškovém angle, which is limited his mobility.
In výškovém angle is fixed, the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
His curiosity is a high degree of flux amplification.

Its main mirror is a full 42 feet and be composed of mirrored elements of nearly 1,000.
But the images can be counted in 2018 at the earliest.
Two Keckovy telescopes on Mauna Hawaiian Kee were considered to be the largest in the world by the year 2007.
They offer just two mirrors, each with an average of 10 meters.
Keckovy telescopes are part of the observatory Mauna Kee, among them, peering through the telescope into space IRTTF and Subaru.
Also on Mauna Kee has created a giant telescope - with třicetimetrovým diameter mirror.
Here you can admire him in the picture.
The most significant impressions from space for us, however, conveys Hubbleův space telescope.
Images of distant worlds gives us since April 24, 1990.
The space telescope Kepler searches since March 2009 after extrasolárních planets - especially after those habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that the 1235 candidate planets have been found since the beginning of the mission.
The final preparations before the launch of the space telescope, Kepler are documented in the picture.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as soon as possible in 2018 will be fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.
The primary mirror space infrared telescope has an average 6.5 inches.
One of the tasks of the telescope is seeking the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that Mercury is also the ice at the South Pole.
For this, however, there is no reliable data because Messenger circling the planet's far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements showed that is ice on Mercury, has been at it for several decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first one, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

Searching for clues in a country where 97letí people are still relatively young.
The driving range Talyš we call wildly romantic.
The bus rumbles down the road with many curves along the densely wooded hills, wild rivers and simple rustic farmhouse.
Everything is green and lush, it almost seems that we're in Schwarzwaldu.
But this here is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The borders with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here lives Caucasian ethnic group Talyšů, on which it is not too well known, except that speaks perfect Farsi and ázerbájdžánsky and living to a very old age.
The final stop is the Lerik.
But this town is too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow inappropriate in the picturesque mountainous countryside.
Tourists from Europe, I don't. The arrival of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours to 323 kilometers, because the road is only jednoproudová.
The fabulous wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, back to the country had not yet arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that the Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
The price of Eurovision - and we came "Baku in May next year, we will have the festival, the oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
Longevity is the director of the museum, about one in the world.
This is documented life nearly eight dozen Talyšů from the neighborhood who are 100 years old or older. Fatullayev shows a black-and-white photo.
It is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years yet fathered a child.
The star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep Şirali Müslümov, which reportedly was 168 years.
The birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And whereas the oldest man in the documents was 122 years old, it seems Müslümovův age extremely doubtful.
Born in 1805 in this field, and died in 1973, "Fatullayev explains.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. In the age of 136 said he had fathered a daughter.
He therefore Şirali Müslümov at his age for a few decades?
He had heard about the ancient people in Central Asia, however, as well as Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Nápadně many old-age lives as well as in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
Because of the lack of background, however, cannot be made if no scientific proof of age, in particular, is situated.
Every day the glass melted butter
But the fact of the matter is that the people in the area around Leriku living biblical age very often.
There are currently 20 persons, which are more than 100 years old.
So why is there so much in the south of the ancient people?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that the specific genes Talyšů.
The director of the museum Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it is based on nutrition.
But that just calorie diet Talyšů, who love the bread, meat and dairy products, and, in particular, many of whom daily drink a cup of melted butter, is so healthy, the bromatologického terms seem very plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, which keeps young people? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, who claims that he has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, which relentlessly rolling.
Eight people, including one of the sons of Mirzajevy and daughter here live under one roof. Both are already grandparents.
Jumping around and two small children.

I've always washing my hair milk, so I didn't and maintain the color.
"I had never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
The monthly pension is enough to life
Eat only what came from her own lawyer, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life, I have not once bought food in the supermarket.
He tells me about her husband, who was in the Army.
It was the worst in the Second World War.
But everything has improved when he took an oar "beloved father Heydar Aliyev.
The propaganda sounds odd from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which makes the peoples around the figure of his father, who ruled as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
His son Ilham was in power in 2003, then took an oar.
The old people in Azerbaijan, at least, do not suffer from a dearth.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manatů (approximately the same amount in euros) is that the debtor, from which you can live well on the situation here.
And perhaps he is right and long grizzled son Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that is not reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The Revolution returned to Cairo.
A rival demonstration in Cairo revealed a deep ambivalence of the country.
The sharply debated the future constitution based on sharia law.
The Egyptian president spare pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And for that, we can do that, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, especially the Copts, but Christian liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular parties.
They all still hopelessly confused opposition squabbling, because they are afraid.
Fear of the "divine nation" on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically told that temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and spread your, to "save the revolution."
What, however, 61letý engineer, who has the title of doctor of the American University in Southern California, really wants to save, in that they do not have the Egyptians or the world record.
The judiciary has to be stripped of power?
234 sections which stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated by Islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly triggered concern.
As in previous constitutions, he says, even in this proposal that the jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what is "principles"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists this vague wording and associated with her lawyer will use the free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it illuminates the newly-added paragraph: On all matters relating to sharia, it is necessary to deal with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the withdrawal of clear-headedness klérus will carry out surveillance of the legislation, which would bring justice court.
In the draft of the Constitution's interpretation of a lot of things
The problem is, also, that the civil jurisdiction of military courts continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody until 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the proposal, the state would also have to protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
From a legal standpoint it is worded so vaguely that using this section could even state institutions to control the content of the film art and literature.
In plain language, it doesn't mean anything other than censorship.
After all, no point in writing does not explicitly define equality between men and women.
But another section prohibits dishonour or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
Unclear, however, is what is the defamation of religions, and how it will be prosecuted.
The wording is equally dubious that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Enough in this case has a caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of law experts?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Mursí present for the signing and, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
"The revolution has returned."
For several weeks the opposition is forming the odds against the Islamists.
In an unusual unity, tens of thousands of people gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night and promised to destroy the constitutional document before it starts to pay.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Sabbáhí Hamdín, who placed in third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution is "to the dustbin of history."
The services of short messages through Twitter accused supporters Mursího, that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy."
"If the referendum passed, we'll go to his palace and toppling him," said a member of the opposition, Yasser Said.
"We're not tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," the Egyptian media quoted a leading opposition politician Khalid Ali.
Several of the judges announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become ineffective.
"The Koran is our constitution."
Well-organised by the Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, out of caution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the river Nile before káhirskou University.
Attended many veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who shouted: "People calls for the application of God's law."
Called Mursího: "Pick the country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over a symbolic square Tahrír, at the place where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war.
This Mursího supporters clearly didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that supporters and opponents of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box and decide which way to go out of the country.
For some it is deemed to be a majority in favour of the Islamists.
"The word 'human rights', not even once"
Forced a constitutional dispute, which should, in fact, continue until February and integrate all social forces, ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa du.
Osmačtyřicetiletý defender of human rights and the president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were in prison or under Mubarak stood before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because, for him, human rights are indivisible.
For that, he was convicted and imprisoned, beaten.
"And in the new constitution now are the words" human rights "even once," she says in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag."
Mursího expansion of power to all three components of power in the state forced the resignation of a lawyer.
These measures are scandalous offense against democratic rules of the game and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead, the president to strengthen civil society, effectively canceled it," Sa da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
SA da feel abandoned by the international community as well, to be followed by a game of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That might haunt them.
Demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "Stvořili you a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: Most stinking fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the local appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheese.
Put them in the middle of the pile of wet and dirty football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
So you can smell paralyzing the stench rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is a beautiful view, the snow - and the ever-present odor hung in the air.
Rakfisk is salty fermented trout in the water for up to one year - depends on how much you want to smell the fish.
How is it dark and is getting cold, beginning with the Norwegians meet at the festival dedicated to this, how best to say it, here in Fagernes nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
"Dreaming it raw and then zapijete drink shall," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," which is responsible for the conduct of the festival.
All around us people are eating fish and celebrating small cubes is a large quantity of alcohol.
"Some people are better than the rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.
The smell can transcend the beverage.
A few bits and pieces I'll try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk poverty is the product of a very different time, when she was in Norway, and because there is no fridge, the fish is in the autumn hated getting wet in airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, plucked and ate - the senses will undoubtedly blunt alcohol.
Only a generation before thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to look for work, and most emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracting a large number of Labour, high earnings and an extensive system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country to work.
The rakfisk is viewed as something important and indispensable, even when fairly smelly part of the past.
Among more expensive meals on the market.
Even when everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich you come to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is the world's reports often lack - and the majority of the population seems to like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing supremacist extremists, who shot 77 men, women and children in the past year, here people still mention with distaste.
Instead, it is called the shooting "an event on July 22."
The Norwegians can hardly believe that one of them was in their peaceful country capable of such brutality and murder.
For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's oil and gas industries of the early 1970s of the twentieth century.
"But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," he says, when submitting plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, with long blond hair and startling blue eyes, is a prototype Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as English of the majority of these people, it is absolutely impeccable.
Nepředvádíme is, we don't like pomp.
Norway deals with its oil wealth is very carefully - except for a small percentage of the majority of the money from the industry invested in a special fund to be used for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw the money they did not have the Norwegians had its purse strings tight.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a careless laugh.
Standing in the snow in line for something to eat - rakfisku I already have enough.
Such an elk burger is certainly something else and it's beautifully succulent.
But the evening's smelly fish here again.
The hotel, in which I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk served for dinner, where guests choose the best, or rather demanding to smell the fish.
Are there connections with live television coverage, in which the host with a bow tie is surrounded by a plate with rakfiskem.
It's like the Eurovision singing.
"What's the score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"This is our scoring, Håvard."
There are the laughter and applause.
The man fell out of his chair, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, staring Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges they face, and at the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
At present, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Steel barriers were erected in the city, which is blocked, even in the best of times, closing several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
Objective, however, did not prevent dojíždějícím in it, to get to work, but to avoid protesters in the approach to the parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a daunting task.
Mexico, at the time the paperwork outgoing Felipe Calderon led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has already taken an estimate as a victim of 60 000 lives in six years.
"My government is a big commitment in the reduction of violence against the Mexican people," the president said, "Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I suggest a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the president shook hands with the American president, won Pena Nieta political experience as governor of their home country of Mexico.
There are different views on a new leader, even in his old home, the vast and populous state surrounding the capital city.
A man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in a good way.
Citizens would be credited with the development of tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
In the city you can now drive along one of the new highways that Pena Nieto left to build. These highways are a vast improvement over the perforated and rugged roads that were here before.
Plates with his name also hangs on the wall of a sports centre and imposing an interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of the State for Labor, the party of President Pena Nieta institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
Particularly interesting in our hope and real change in the area of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After continuous 81 years in power have been ousted the PRI party Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, intra-party from Enrique Pena Nieta much is expected.
The new president as a man without substantial content and the opposition refused to comment.
It's a very straightforward man, very preoccupied with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, is a man who knows how to listen.
But, on the other hand, there is the impression that has a lot of people from its former governor of this state.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Hold, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be clearer.
Tucked beneath dálničními culverts in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
And the problems in the local community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help with managing drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, violence against women is particularly poignant.
Only in the last two years were in the desolate places beside a vast landfill waste littered the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
At a time when he was the governor of Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women have been murdered in Mexico state, which is far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a case critics Pena Nieta say during his tenure in office had failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.
And in the worst case, his leadership accused of escapism.
In a concrete house, typical for me, the ramshackle neighborhood Irinea Buendía shows photographs of their deceased daughter Marian Luna and suppresses tears.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family believes, however, that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I came to her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Mrs. Buendía recalls.
There were signs on him after strikes and had already begun rigor mortis.
As her mother tells a story, Marian staring down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is a single word: "Justice."
However, this is as a family says exactly what's been denied them.
The government departments they treat me like I was a troublemaker, the old gossip and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and were silent.
"But it cannot be right when it came to many errors and omissions," he says.
Sash, received by the president of Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a sense of great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families were affected by violent crime in Mexico, the new president promised during his tenure in office will be his priority.
"I hope the president will be the same, as he was a governor," he says in Valle del Bravo, a member of the PRI Olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Hold fears most.
Bradley Manning complained of ill-treatment, the military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor trying to rebut allegations Bradley Manning on rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of gross mistreatment Manningem in jail.
The private is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which he allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein during the cross-examination of Private Manning in Maryland in the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede argued that the records of weekly visits that Manning had links with the officers of the unit in the course of nine months at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination, which occurred in the course of the hearing, conducted at the request of the defence to dismiss the case against manning because of the rough treatment while in detention, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that in custody contemplating suicide.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents in the course of their duty in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not claimed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing through the military prosecutor Fein alongside Manningem forms that officers fill out after meeting with Manningem in the detention center in Quantico, where he was held from July 2010 to April 2011 in the scheme with increased security.
The officers manning asking the questions and recording the answers.
When these forms on Friday Fein asked him Manning admitted that the treatment by their guards be assessed as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility be assessed as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, even if the officers asked Manning directly on how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that orally expressed concerns regarding the various problems, and that the officers, who visited him, talked with him about these concerns and suggested that these problems, however, they will deal with them.
"Zapsali had" no problems "(after discussed concerns), and it does not necessarily mean that I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind asked Manning also why he complained about the treatment of his party in January 2011, when meeting with the commission examining the suicidal thoughts, which a few months earlier expressed in the form.
Manning said that, in the course of this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction scheme "prevention of injury."
The army said that for him this restrictive regime (one degree below the supervisory regime on the grounds of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards are in custody, to know that I'm OK and that I wanted to abolish the scheme of injury prevention... to enjoy enhanced the quality of life, as I see it," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine base at Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait and once there fainted because of the heat.
He said that he was not allowed to know what will become of him and what's happening in the rest of the world, it was very depressing.
"My world is focused only on the base Arifdžán, on the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
Manning said that he had spent most days (at least 21 hours after arriving at Quantico, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said that he had tried to walk, because sleeping or just in the course of a day camp was against the rules.
Manning said that he always slept with the light on the outside of the cell in his eyes.
The guards said that if they could not see his face, when he turned in the middle of the night, on the other hand, woke him and had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Private Manningem in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges, which raised in Thursday's testimony, on that one night after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, was also forced to stand naked in front of the other inmates and guards during the counting of the morning.
In the calculation, Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover his blanket.
During Friday's hearing by Judge Manning said that, on the orders of their guards, he decided that he had to postpone a blanket, which could conceal, but admitted that he was ordered to postpone it, no one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning testified that the night before he was forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he was not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his eyeglasses and slippers.
His lawyer hopes that Judge shall take into account of his experiences during his detention, and that in the event of a conviction before a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, will significantly reduce his punishment.
The defense has argued that projected that Manning admits to fault in the lesser crimes, and that he will fight against the other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The start of a hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the detention conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon said the declaration that Manning was held in accordance with rules on all of those arrested held in a maximum-security detention.
Among the charges against manning include aiding the enemy, illegal infliction of transmission of information relating to national security, intelligence documents on the Internet and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; remind them hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I was barely elbowed his way through the crowd, and I got into the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I ran into a problem.
Arrow pointing to one of the two fronts: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life I've been called the "Mexican".
It is ethnic stands, "and my friends in New York are the same as when my friends in Boston called" the Irish themselves are known as "the Italians."
So after I finished with the label of "the Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use the symbol.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in that language.
But I don't know how to get rid of an American accent and vocabulary of native speakers.
So I pulled out his American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros."
I thought about the moment this week's newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed, when the leaders of the two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the likelihood that Mexicans will remain in Mexico is the same as that travel to the United States.
He wants to get in touch with the United States and Canada and to create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico's complicated relationship with the United States and filled with hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks in centuries, not minutes, observations are ubiquitous.
So a minute after Representative of the United States to say something a little critical of Mexico, you will hear complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of its neighbor in the Mexican press and among the elite.
And children Montezumy steps on the warpath.
Yet it is the real challenge for Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
That's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers the possibility, and others, who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree was the person, maybe the parent or grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than it should have been, this person fit the profile - dark skin, a weak education, the origin of a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And now we are living the American dream, go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico's.
Our identity is not our loyalty, but sometimes it may be unclear.
It is against the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
He sees us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, I would never leave him.
And we are now nenalézali imprisoned for the silk curtain, with the good life in the United States, but despite the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally traveled to the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Even if he is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many Mexican Americans, you know, feel as part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican groups, los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You don't have the best of both countries, but its roots in either one.
In Mexico we viewed as the Americans.
And we have considered Mexicans in the United States.
And to complicate relations, part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, and some Mexican leaders want to re-connect with the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a makeshift "ambassadors" and represented the Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens, how wonderful it is to visit the country, and pressure on political leaders to shore up relations with Mexico.
Well.
Thus, it won't happen again.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because income inequality and prevalent corruption and drug violence, many of us, it is not certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States how to deal with Mexico in front of one and a half a century, we must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation over the way it dealt with the members of their family in the past, much closer.
Hmmm.
We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The old battles, a new Middle East
Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain as the basis for peace.
Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, has been amended many buildings in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis and, for the first time, the rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even if it appears that the Israelis and the Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, change with the Middle East.
The Arab Spring has changed the old calculus and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Perhaps it will mean that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
But there are reasons to think that it may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at the present time, it is not much cause for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire signed last November 21, strengthen the hawks on both sides of the fight for this week.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forcing the Israelis to retreat, though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the most pitiful and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his digging rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists gain greater influence throughout the Arab world, that Hamas won the rich and the powerful friends.
Turkey, revived a regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined on the side of Hamas. As well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say the Islamic crescent circles around Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the ruling party / militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar al-Assad, after Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on Israel's southern flank the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, by far the most populous and flagship of the Arab countries under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího, changed the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled for 30 years until his downfall in 2011 in Egypt, had on Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player who cannot be excluded either Israel or America.
Israeli hardliners, however, come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome antimissile system proved their worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In a diplomatic terminology is America as hard as always. Many European countries also blaming Hamas for the start of the latest round of violence.
And especially - Israel prospered, in particular, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 of the Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from the bomb suicide bombers, thanks in part to the wall, which protects Jewish settlements, which are still growing and intervenes in the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian state, despite its illegality in front of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is at the beginning of the campaign to 22 January elections combined with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If he really ruled on the West Bank, so would neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we stay behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads.
Hardliners might win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Even though the Islamists, who gained power in Egypt and other countries, have little affection for Israel, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israeli defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all four of his Arab neighbors together.
The opening of a new war with the local superpower hardly new Arab governments will help to heal its economy.
It is a good sign that President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama on achieving a cease-fire and may mark the beginning of something new.
The Israelis also should look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a barrel of gunpowder, the denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination, which must one day in areas occupied by Israel to explode - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Currently the repression weaken democracy and demography in the Jewish state, is making the situation worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza on every few years in order to push Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they preached reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: Two states, Israel claims the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that a cease-fire by pressures from the outside at least a little bit more influence to enforce this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must commit to a halt in the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem shared and exchange of parts of the country.
The Arabs from outside must also push for consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
It would make more than an immediate offer of virtual statehood in the United Nations for the creation of a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has its share of it, how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term negligent performance of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, appears to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia have entered into force the laws on bad cigarette packaging
The shabby green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, warnings are designated for smokers and diseased parts of the body.
In force entered Australian laws on tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, ugly packaging and logos and colors brands replaced general olive green boxes with ugly pictures of diseased parts of the body and display of children and infants sick as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to a variety of health warnings and pictures are compulsory from Saturday brand names, the only difference between the boxes, which are printed in small letters.
This is the strictest in the world on tobacco packaging.
Australian federal government argues that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by failing to get rid of this habit of its attractiveness.
Relying on a study showing that if people start smoking until the age of 26 years, the chances that never start smoking is 99%.
"I can see for very small children, that means a message that they are trying to sell the tobacco companies together with their product," he says, federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and cites studies that, for example, have shown that children joined at the crown logo with the idea for it to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering the introduction of similar events.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will result in cheaper and more abundant cigarettes.
"With this legislation would lead to substantial unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre from society, British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgers from China and Indonesia bring much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Some argue that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha from society Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, she said, that the demand on cigarette packages of silicon used to cover unsavoury boxes, two months before, when the company of Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal to the Supreme Court, on bills to Australia's sales increased from almost zero.
Ha said that the company sold Zico almost 6 000 wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a potential snag experts cite the popularity of social media at the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sports events and demanding that the majority of dealers hiding cigarettes before the direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia banned the Internet advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a worker in the tobacco industry marketing and leaves you only this small space for the promotion of your products, is the place where you want to be insurmountable online space for you," says Becky Freeman, a research scientist in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman noted an increase in the evaluation of the brands on social networking sites, such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, carried out by "the average John."
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the job and created this video, or marketing company is involved in this?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry focused on how to deal with the new regulations, than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules - the country within the framework of the World Trade Organisation argue that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia deals significantly.
The ruling PPW is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has led the talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning pictures in 2001.
Now widened to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
They think of stricter laws of Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
He resists many smokers in Australia.
The pictures do not have any influence on me.
Just ignore them.
"Just take a cigarette out and put the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying boxes of photographs of the tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, it is only one reason to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the pack in downtown Sydney, argues that the single packs makes it harder for him to come to terms on the shelves.
"discharge cargo took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should ban it completely, then we would have said, 'OK, this is the end, closing shop'," he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of constant connection isn't so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come to praise nudění.
They say that it is good for us (and) our children are sometimes bored.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we don't have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Therefore, we should support the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But for that to come back.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of the book says Boredom: A Lively History (history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found the Latin inscription relating to boredom, dating from the first century A.D.
And then there is also the question of how we define the boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, "said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario in Canada.
After viewing demonstration of the idea of the target group of about 100 people and research literature professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as an experience, "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't capable of that."
Boredom is the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but I would be different from apathy.
He says that there is an urge to do something for apathy.
He says that "the disruption of the process of attention is at the core of boredom, joined in a bad mood and feeling slowly ubíhajícího time."
Boredom may remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a reciprocal relationship, they have nudící, people tend to see the problem as the environment or people who are depressed, while the rest of the world sees the problem within ourselves.
Sometimes we think that's boring, if we only have trouble concentrating.
In its study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which the participants listened to the tape, in which a person reading the article out of the magazine.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so low that he barely noticed, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly, reported more boredom than the other two groups - had trouble concentrating but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties boredom.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or engaging task, the distortion of the attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you're doing something boring, "such as the search for the bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help with that, you got bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that, in fact, twisting and drawing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can help to fight boredom and keep people physically alert.
"Research shows that children, who are allowed to move around, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," Professor Fenske said.
We all sometimes boredom experienced - my flight delays, roaring speaker, particularly lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a greater chance to get bored than others.
For help with boredom measurement of the scientists in the 1980s had developed "a scale for susceptibility to nudění" Boredom Proneness Scala).
The scale covers issues such as: "Many of the things that I must do is repeated, and is monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have the time to do it all."
By using these scales scientists have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular as regards the need to have more and different external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor at the University of Illinois, an experiment for human and social development, in which seven to eight times a day contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said that they were bored, when they were in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But said that he knows that "adolescence is the time for the boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "It's good for you boring?".
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, the physical risks can lead people to undergo absurd, playing games or addictive substance abuse as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were discussed, the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain is always the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and use the energy to play the guitar and cooking, you'll be happy to do it.
If, however, you'll be watching TV, makes you happy just for a little while, not a long-term basis.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, will no longer be bored, but to learn how to attach itself or separately, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child learn only how to attach itself, but will gain greater control in other areas.
I don't think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we should not be too critical to her.
Instead, our aim should be to feel comfortable when we're out of the range of the constant ringing of the business and technology.
Professor Eastwood said.
"blame it needs even more bored, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is how to relax and enjoy free time.
"In the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is hard to find ways to seized when the noise switched off."
There is no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Nineteen Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and a football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal in the state as a whole - for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which he used to her smoking.
Mr Orozco said that a September day rode with a couple of friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - petty crimes for which the penalty is for every $100 - and he was a court date.
"It looked to us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado a vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response from the hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures, repealed.
Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years of age and older for possession of a small quantity, which will be legally permitted after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorado have said that they will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.
At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains votes to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their communities.
"This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The head of a gossip and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, at first, Colorado, whether for good or bad, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, and now, as well as recreation.
"Colorado has regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Council for the awarding of licenses for the sale of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or the system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also left the annual vacuum, during which the state licensing system will still exist, but legal possession, yes.
And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the state's directive on "a responsible approach" to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playground or children's centres.
"There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently-based research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora his officers of the e-mail in which they announced that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of a small quantity of marijuana for each and every citizen aged 21 years and that the police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will promote municipal laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents District Attorney Ken Buck stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push on users to seek treatment.
Is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, even though many of them are facing another charge.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offense, which was crimes at the time they occurred," Mr Buck said in its statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places like rural district, Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, already adults responsible for possession of a small quantity.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all pending cases of possession.
"I don't think losing his time until a continuation in law enforcement, will not change," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters support the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state green experiment with regard to this great state has revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials.
For the district prosecutors is that "the cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the laws relating to marijuana.
"Strávili prosecution of people that still cannot really take so much of her life, it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat a small quantity of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for the legalization of drugs.
Advocates and state authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised sales and at the same time also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still in the plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice complies.
Despite several arrest vendors of marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it to attract attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in the operation.
While protidrogoví agents will probably not break down the door, to pick up a small bag with the drug, it is likely to fight back, allowing state-controlled stores with recreational marijuana for new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policies of President Obama's administration.
A number of Colorado cities waiting on the procedure of the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, even though it will take about a year before they will be able to open any trade.
Last week the city Montrose a half-year ban proposed in the western part of the state, and it is likely that next week will come into force.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where someone we license and then we will have a federal case out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against the amendment.
Look at what a municipality voted, compared to what had happened.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt said: "I was forced to leave from Oxford, because I'm a conservative."
But today's college students are attacked for their views.
Remember that I would ever dream of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university, about which I thought that knowledge is the world's largest seat, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, tolerance and freedom of thought.
And yet I think at the end of the 1980s into two weeks after boarding at Worcester College, where I wanted to study the history of the twentieth century, packed suitcases and I swept into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I didn't give up, because I objected to love of students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson playfully said that I left, because I was forced to drink from battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I was the subject of a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I was being pursued in this cradle of alleged enlightenment and for one reason was that both barbaric and bigoted: My father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, a senior adviser Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why yank it until now.
Simply because recent reports indicate that a new generation of students to the right of center suffer similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week was a group of these students demanding the same protection of equal rights, which are gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of younger people (JCR) at Corpus Christi College maintains that because of their political views "are often subjected to personal attacks, actively isolated, and they made clear that they are not welcome."
Demand equal opportunities for the creation of a position in the university committee that would ensure that his views may communicate freely.
They didn't help the situation neither recently that BBC television documentary entitled Two Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (stories of the country: The young, intelligent and right-wing) on student politics, which conservatives described as odd and neo-Nazis.
On the agenda was presented a graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), the conservative Association of the University of Oxford, who drove a silver Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a staff of the head.
Conservative students at other universities say that is due to the introduction of higher tuition treated as "scapegoats" with them.
A 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association Nottinghamské University), he told a Sunday newspaper, that "left-wing influence is growing at universities.
People feel that we're as Bullingdon Club, without ever meeting with us. "
A student of history at Corpus Christi said Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is "bad," while devatenáctiletá elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says in the approach of the JCR members against the people to the right of center has worsened.
"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first weeks in Oxford, I was a member of a minority.
I started in September 1986, 18letá and cripplingly shy.
Hatred against the Conservative party was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier the university voted to reject the awarding of an honorary degree of Margaret Thatcher's former student due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere would be even Stalinists shivered concerns.
During the first few days in the opening week, when new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of wormwood, who had to come.
I discovered that not only professors tacitly approving needling conservative students, but with gusto, he also attended.
The policy was introduced in the paneled poslucháren mining strikes, privatization, and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture focused on the translation of the text of the 18th century French into English and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate the first paragraph, please."
It's hard enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a lot of dough dessert was bilious.
"thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are just stupid?" he asked.
The other students snickered.
Tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you took some basic lessons in his spare time French, that is, if you're not too busy social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Heartbroken I returned to my room.
At the dinner I sat alone in the school, when I felt a tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore student named James, who identified himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said softly.
Unfortunately, this is so.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
Most of the conservative freshmen pretends that are labouristi.
Later at a local pub, cowardly, I tried to pretend.
I insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: "You are the daughter fascist pig."
You are infected.
The other students took with him notovali.
I was perverse, messy.
"How will the Conservatives love?" one asked.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt like the need to feel homosexuals from the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
I could ever to lead a normal life in Oxford?
I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I'd have to be converted into labouristu and suppress your natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me to develop as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
Norman Stone, professor of modern history, was the only openly conservative professor who was at my school.
It was hated not only for being conservative, but also for the fact that is one of those who write her speeches and Margaret Thatcher's adviser for foreign policy.
It almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for his parochialism and pettiness and for his choice of Marxist-deterministickému perspective on history.
The professor came on the scene in 1997 at Bilkentské University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't happy here," he told me.
I began to travel from Oxford to his parents' house in London, seeking refuge at their uncommitted metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s were accepted by all political views.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
It wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.
Even my communist friends have always had the perfect manners.
His moist eyes became troubled.
Try it again.
I am sure that it was only a joke.
My heart would break if you left.
Exhausted frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience deteriorated.
A friend of mine, a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in utter seriousness I declare that "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even when I was inside flushed with shame, I confessed to my parents "brainwashed" and called it "old fogies."
The relief was only short-term.
My father hammered a nail in the coffin of my career.
At the time he wrote two columns every week to Murdochových newspapers.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and give it my pursuers after five minutes.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and grabbed the first train to London.
I've never came back.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But no 18letá girl or boy should not be subject to this kind of intimidation in the educational institution and rancor.
Even more tragic is, however, that it was Oxford, of which only came 14 conservative prime, but who is also behind the undeserved reputation points to date, with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has elegance rather than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the creative fashion," which was launched this week in London, talking with ABC Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, an ancient residence Isabel off his back I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host the exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the opening of the sumptuous retrospective, "Valentino: Master fashion" formation, which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by the studio of his for the last 50 years.
"This lock love," he says, with his unmistakable an Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of the story, in which "is" il Signore Garavani but without his cherished clients, the only player who could be written.
Valentino has always felt charmed rare and distant world aristocracy.
The first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is a private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from the Princess Salimy Aga Khan across the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England after Lord Snowdona.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of their social rise: Simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy on the international idol "Bohemian royalty."
Like there's nothing wrong with the royal family.
"They did at least netípnou stub cigarettes into a fine carpet, as do some wonderful celebrity pop-music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960s and 1970s we were good friends and we both lived in the Alps.
Valentino is impressive host and guests enjoy abundant and with grace.
"All of us are very pleased when we were invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains ex "Heiniho Thyssena" and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchosová.
"Valentino has always had the elegance rather than glory.
And so, too, is a star. "
Valeria Mazzová flaunted Valentine
In the presence of someone who was designer forgets or Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been many years since we went after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to join him for dinner.
It was twenty of us and among us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, the decor, the music, the food, everything was and he felt his spirit.
Everyone was invited because of him can feel important and loved, "says a top model, which started working with him during Paris fashion week summit in 1995.
"I never goes out of style, because his proposals are works of art," he concludes.
A parade of nobility
Gravaniho life is a tale of obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
They loved him and he loved the people with good manners and better titles.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was rebuilt on a seventy meters long passage, which offers an exchange of roles: The visitor will change to a model and marching passages, to watch the "audience" dreams, of which Valentin's masterpieces like clothes that she chose Jackie Kennedy wore at her wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume, who wore Monica Vittiová in "Night," or a coat of fur and wool, which belonged to the Empress Farah Dibaové.
In the audience models of September names like Luxembourg Sibilla, Gloria of Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit Norwegian, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, "it is impossible to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
It was the autumn-winter collection of trousers, shirt, jacket and vest "Gillette" from 1971-1972.
It was a gift, which he did for me, "says Naty Abascalová, one návrhářových muses.
"I give him in front of the other priority for his great love for women, because underscores our beauty and femininity," added the former Duchess Ferii.
"I don't like colors, which uses a lot rozjasňují and give the" spark "face.
The proportions are perfect. "
Even the fashion icon and the Princess Patricia Della Giovampaola d 'Arenberg Valentine cannot forget how to dress for the first time.
As a teenager, and lived in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes.
At the end of the day was at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress since Valentine on the occasion of the celebrations at the castle of his cousin, Prince Edouarda de Ligne.
They were red dress, which had the top of a strapless and billowy, flounced bodice with a skirt.
It was a dream, which has become a reality, "says the widow Rodriguovi d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless," explains Italian aristocrat, whose life is between New York, Paris and Buenos Aires.
Princess d 'Arenberg has imposed návrhářovy dress "very carefully... because clothes are not only clothes, it is also a set of memories, which are in themselves."
"The King" fashion
The centerpiece of the exhibition at Somerset House, Marie-Chantal Miller are a wedding dress for her wedding with Pavel Greek in 1995.
On the creation of a silk dress with ivory color všitými pearls, 12 different types of lace and a need for four months of work were four and a half feet long and 25 "girls" (as the designer called his seamstresses).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkesové, most of the authority of the specialised press, representing these clothes landmark summit fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from high society."
Valentino dazzled during the years of the "elitist savoir-être" is the best example of his now.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated of the Legion of Honour accumulate so many accolades as any spouse of his clients.
"You always attracted the attention of his vybranost, quiet, neat and perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d 'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
It was a great time for him to leave no trace. "
He says that the princess.
The toughest job in the world: The bearers of sulphur in the field of Kawah Ijen volcano
For four of the euro gamble medium in the area of the Indonesian volcano with his life and health, when 70 kilos of sulphur swoop down the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who are literally working in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners, who earn a living conquest of sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day fárat up on the floor of the crater, where sulfur gases escaping from the interior of the Earth, and in contact with air passes into a solid state.
After all the large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, carrying them on their shoulders in two bamboo baskets after the steep stone paths.
At the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 yards, it's just 250 yards, but exhausted bearers takes more than 40 minutes to get up at the pace of a tortoise, because his steps to maintain the balance and thoroughly reflected neuklouzli and nezřítili looked into the abyss.
They know that any misstep could cost him his life, as it happened, one French turistce, which years ago collapsed from the rocks Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each pound of sulfur, which earns
When they are at the top, making his way past the tourists, who is tired of photographs, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and carry heavy weight toward the basket, which the mining company ranked slightly below, in 1850 metres altitude.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, in a volcano, benefit from 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life and is to be used for the manufacture of matches, entertaining fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we normally carries 70 pounds, earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," Anto explained to us, which usually undergo three trips a day.
One way he takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but they can earn 138, 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Though it seems like a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what he earned in the field.
"The wage miners here is very high, for example, is paid for the collection of coffee per day and a salary of 15,000 rupees ($1.2 billion) in a fortnight's two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a valid reason, which is as convincing as sulphur: "I Married with a young girl from Bali in Indonesia, which is Hindu, and I took her to Java, to have converted to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he kept his eyes and coughing, breathing the toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto three times a day he's risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur put on him has already begun to take its toll, even though her face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, poorly kept his eyes and coughing, breathing the toxic gases, which escapes from the volcano.
This is the price that must pay for it, in order to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years, because I want to open a store or to study French or Spanish," promises more than a passable English.
This likable and intelligent young man racked fate could be tourist guide, waiter or reception in the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the rack.
Shares dirty wooden shack with other carriers and every day rises at two o'clock in the morning, because of her characteristic yellow glow in the dark and amended in blue and sulphur in the middle of the night continues to break out.
Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and sheds light on his way to a lamp, which is attached to his helmet, and he bought her for their money.
About 400 media rules on the shoulders of the basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high-sulphur production due to cost savings, revenue nezmechanizovala, nor provide porters working on his own and with such vigor, no equipment.
Nor do not receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from a surcharge for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees ($1.2 billion) collect natural park wardens from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for the people," pleads Madrusin, burly 42letý Porter, who works in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left the school.
 He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that it will work, "as long as possible," because he needs the money for the education of his three sons aged between 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, since the volcano was my whole life
Although sulphur burn the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind suddenly turn and snared the miners in thick fumes coming from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them complaining that suffers from serious diseases... but it is evident from the frequent respiratory difficulties, into arthritis, the wounds on the shoulders and knee pain caused by the weight of their baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back at the age of 53, he can no longer serve only 50 pounds.
Every day he and his colleagues vydolují in a volcano 15 tonnes of sulphur, which then three trucks transporting a steep path through the thicket into storage in Tamansari 18 miles distant.
"I am not going to retire, I'm going to die here, since the volcano was my whole life," declares Unainik and opens his mouth wide, in which is missing a few teeth.
The oldest of his five sons, 30, also makes mining sulphur.
Time passes, but chronic poverty remains one of the world's most difficult crafts from generation to generation - craft carrying out human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies, in order to save the economy
Singapurci herd that have no children, on a career, the stress and the cost of living and education.
"Population Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you are a patriot. Splňme their civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of advertising on LifeSavers, but still - or perhaps because of - the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local hints of a type of "give a cake in the oven," a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency, BUT, who created the video, hopes that with this advertising, they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a humorous way.
Artistic Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to fulfill their "civic duty."
"This is purely a matter of the Internet, so it must be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a topic that we touch.
We knew that the government tried to expand on a lot of things such as perfumes with pheromones or organize familiarisation parties.
While many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not here nejkreativnější possible case, such as the composition of rap, to solve this problem. "
1.2 children
Whoever takes it very lightly, it is the Government of Singapore.
A year spent $1 300 to encourage people to have more children.
The government's package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extending maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures have had little effect, though.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in the south-east Asia, also known konzervatizmem of its leaders and the strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore with regard to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is regarded as the recovery rate in 1976.
Why Singapurci do not have more children?
Mingová Tan Wei, director of the department of marriage and the family of the National Office for the population, he says, it is because of "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"People that are available to a wider range of options as regards the objectives and priorities, it is not only a wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and childbirth. The result is a reduction in fertility rates in Singapore.
While there were efforts in the context of immigration policy drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against a decline in the number of inhabitants, it caused resentment among local residents.
On some of the Singapore websites to see them open xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort on integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for the last year, the Singapore government Party its worst election result since the beginning of the independence.
The attempt to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers appeared after the elections.
The unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there is also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to do, to be offered as many small home.
For example, she affect trade with real estate.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments known as "a shoe box," which could be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments are 46 square meters of space, and had a great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that these apartments can promote bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the developers EL Developers, claims that their "a shoe box" sell far more quickly than larger homes.
"They are more popular, and so that it will sell for days and weeks at a faster pace than the houses with a larger size.
Because they are so much better for our cash flow. "
Developers, who were previously limited admits, however, that the new standards set out clear rules, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one of the project.
Too much on edge
Singapore is the city-state.
Although the new rules could lead to an increase in birth rates in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the city centre suggests that will not have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, like education, because it puts a lot of people," says a young officer.
"Others may have children.
But for me, it is important to rely on their own money and time, "says another, about a young man, a 20-year-old.
Men and women cite a career, stress, and the cost of living and education as the reasons which prevents them from having children.
So let the government tries to force citizens in any way to have children, they are eventually Singapurci, who have the last word on the setting-up of the family.
What is private property is private and online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy is something that is personal in nature, or about "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What is a person under the age of 16 years for privacy?
How is this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Understands the danger, which is issued when matters published on the Internet, which would certainly didn't tell anyone in normal communications?
Journalists from elPeriódico interview five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases considered the concept of privacy as "something very own" on a personal level, and for "your user name and password," when it came to social networks.
"He's the greatest secret I credit," says a ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy at places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"We FB give nice photos or pictures of how we play.
He also said there are known.
Did I mocked the photo, which would not be mine, or a picture of someone, "he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures, photographs of naked people or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or coarse comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends, which has nine on FB and his followers on Twitter.
The majority are related.
The mother, who has a name and password for one of the accounts was among them.
"I Založil account on Twitter, to be able to express their views and write the interesting contributions.
I don't know if someone says to me, I just give them, "he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with relatives who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says, would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Even if he didn't care if he had been recommended by someone unknown.
The case of a 14-year Jose is different.
The teenager accounts on the networks of its own Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and at last the network admits that he doesn't know 20 people from its list of friends.
"I'm not worried about that, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to this boy had none of them for nothing nenaváděl, even after it didn't address or telephone number.
"If over me or simply remove them from your account, that demand from me," admits.
José volunteered to Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
"Known friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was, "confirmed.
The victim, according to Jose neodhlásila from his account.
"Just to activate the private system."
After a series of steps, explains how the bill set safely.
Unlike Jorge this boy would be published pictures known in embarrassing or awkward situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone resented me, or should I just wanted.
Even though I know that it is cyberbullying, "he says.
The key issues
Marielos Porrasová, a teacher of English and graduate business classes and Teaching, considers that children and adolescents in social networks to focus properly, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is informed.
Says: "Internet originated as a means of finding information, but, as social networks appeared, the rules of the game have changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that Marc Prensky, a graduate academic pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, introduce these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We teach digital immigrants who need them, and they will only learn for themselves, "he says.
Explains spread, publish, and say that this is a complex issue, "because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate, and what they cannot, in an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be - what concerns surrounding - circumspect, at a time when what is most wants to be popular, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to this Specialist asking questions, privacy is the most effective way to show children and adolescents, what is it that makes them think.
"telling them to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the possibilities: Are the things you told a stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or would you like it, if someone published a picture of you as you published a pal's?
Do you know what the rest of you should be published?
When označuješ persons to photos of the celebrations, you asked permission to these people?
And one more: Everyone always need to know, what are you doing now?
The other point is to realize that they must behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"One out of respect, morals and other principles governing the Internet and at the same it should be on social networks," says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a teacher, a university professor in the first instance and educational consultant explains that it is essential that the parents of the children read the rules carefully social networks.
"If understand every guile, have a good basis to talked with their children about the consequences that establishing an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or to publish, "he says.
 Guardia is of the view that it's crucial to remember the children the traditional rule "don't talk to strangers."
The summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima confidential
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the Lima Declaration, which was issued was avizováno and which was reportedly signed by the presidents of seven.
The agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government Organization Unasur, but the presidential office, who set at the beginning that the document will be published at the end of the summit, as well as representatives of the Foreign Ministry, said that he would later published on the website of the Peruvian government.
Peruvian President Ollantou Humala is further claimed that the content was published in several short press statements.
Journalists have limited access to information for the duration of the summit.
During the course of the negotiations was in the press room transmitted video from a presidential meeting with the report without sound "confidential meetings, to prevent the transmission of sound."
A small quantity of information that should be available to the press, it was granted press spokesmen of some governments, who were meeting in the room, but not Peruvian spokesman.
A list of the participating presidents was a single document published during the negotiations, which triggered the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Later sent Peruvian presidential media office e-mail, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is only an expression of President Humaly, and not on an official document, which the summit concluded.
Last October hosted the third summit of Peru Jihoamerických and Arab countries (América del Sur-países Árabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion was originally promised the Lima Declaration published, even though the press has been eagerly required.
The ASPA official site can be established that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings to completely stop the flow of information, but the Peruvian authorities to ensure the broadcasting for all journalists.
The summit ended, among other things, a joint undertaking of Chile and Peru with a view to the adoption of the Hague judgment of the Court of Justice, to resolve the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's president Ollanta Humala, the Chilean president Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing the defence speech to deal with both sides of the dispute, which began in Lima against Santiago.
"obey the and do the judgment, which will solve the dispute which we are discussing today in this international court," the president said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," said Piñera and greeted the president Humalu handshake with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents, he shall be subjected to the ruling of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week adopted Bogotský pact, which expressed submission to the judgments of the international court, which ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua and Colombia this decision deemed totally wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur in 2011 after then-President Fernando Luga appeals and involved in the meetings.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for the opening of the morning speeches and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document in which reported that 16 of the agreements was taken and was scheduled to operate on 31 projects between the South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted mentioned that UNASUR member countries of the organization to take "important steps towards the goal in the form of South American citizenship, for which they are extended stay agreements."
Informed that they were encouraged by actions to improve cooperation "in the fight against international organized crime and civil insecurity, to improve the availability of medicines and low-cost Internet in all corners of South America and the common and effective measures" against the risks of natural disasters.
When Europe is in crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (in Latin America), winning the estate, but it could serve to increase our productivity and to show a better future for our peoples," Humala said.
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects to improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural areas and the border areas of... that our country should be better connected, and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a speech čteném.
Mention that five of these projects concerns transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil and Peru, and the other two relate better links with Ecuador, more details, however, failed.
The final document will also touch on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope the electoral process in this country will serve to her return to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues that the summit highlighted the need to remain peaceful and prosperous areas of Latin America, which is solid and he has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before its participation in a regional meeting that he hopes to meet Saturday in Mexico with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the dispute on the maritime borders, which is in dispute Bogotou.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) to meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"Projednáme all the solutions, none are excluded, nor a contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he emphasized.
"I hope I'll be able to say to President Ortega negotiations conducted what civilized and kindest possible form," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega meet Saturday in Mexico, where they are to attend the presidential inauguration Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
In the context of the summit is pre-EU defense ministers met to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defense of the area.
Members of the organisation UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Uruguay and Paraguay, although the country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa announced today, that goal is the creation of a joint citizenship, in which "really must learn from Europe to South America, in this case."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential Jihoamerické Union of Nations (Unasur) summit in Lima, said in the state TV Perú, that the Europeans "were killed during World War II," and in other conflicts, "but now they are virtually one country."
In this sense, the creation of a South American citizenship, which support the member countries of the Organisation Unasur defended the project.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the framework of any South American country, which is already under way among members of the Andean Community, however, there are still backward areas that we want to go back to the past," he said.
Ecuador's president, expressed, inter alia, that agrees with the redeployment of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition that will reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, never to be useless bind, and all of the South Americans, on the other hand, we will sign.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights in Washington, D.C., is funded by the United States, "he said in allusion to political asylum from Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa said that he regrets this decision, because it betrayed its principles, and respect their "profound democratic values and human rights."
Said that at the time "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country without regard to the ongoing process."
In addition, the Swedish justice who criticised him demanded that he underwent questioning on Swedish territory because of alleged sexual infringement, "the Swedish legislation of their own to conduct the questioning videokonferenčním call, which could be taken from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that the Assangeho will lead to a deterioration in the physical and psychological health.
"Have I'm with him since he was in the embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a tiny lung problems, but nothing serious," said Ecuador, the head of state.
"Within that his physical and psychological state worse, because it is locked in a small space, but without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would have affected the health of everyone, "said.
President Correa said that dealing with the asylum granted Assange since June to still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the talks with London in order to solve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We use such a word about human rights are not negotiating, in this case, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings in various European bodies, "he said.
It said that "if Britain gives a pass tomorrow, it would be the end of it."
And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears on still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows the legislation without a problem, as has been done in other cases, this problem tomorrow will be made out. "
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and make it clear that it does not tolerate bad intentions, "podprůměrnost and lies which undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of a free press is not us, mean and vicious politicians, but bad press in the service of profit pressures and blackmail, "he said.
From this point of view expressed joy over the fact that Ecuador lacked such journalists, "neither bankers nor hegemonic countries and even the bourgeoisie," and said that, if re-elected, "continue the changes instituted the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain a veto by Paraguay on membership Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and netolerovat opportunism and pučismus wrapped into the legality" because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Ecuador's president, in addition, has said that he considers "entirely appropriate" wishes his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the days following the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South American and-countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.
It is necessary to assess broadly to have been overcome, and was able to move forward. "
Chile and Peru have also expressed hope for a settlement of the dispute on the maritime borders, which deals in the same court, and expressed the view that "it was right for Latin America to seek an international resort, where the two countries commit to accept the judgment, whatever will be tough."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to try for a third mandate in order, he said, that the perception of this possibility, "with a great deal of optimism and joy, even when it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if loses the election in February 2013, leaves from public life.
"I personally never cared much, but so unfair situations, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, they can only correct political power.
My political movement believed that it is I who guarantees this unlikely victory, so we must accept this responsibility, "he said.
"If I had won, it would be my last term, and then I walked away from politics.
If we lose, I'll be doing the same thing.
I've already decided, "he said.
Correa has also mentioned the new Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's medical treatment in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolásem Madurem, which says that President Chávez left for the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the state of health of the president, "he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State are part of the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed today calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain equality, development and security.
The victims of AIDS today are the result of the late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of his test: HIV-positive.
"It's like a bolt of lightning struck me," "softening" told in his memory at the moment of truth, that the doctor tried, but apparently without success.
The boy was kept from the family.
He decided to take his own illness on their shoulders and began to inform it. And with such vigor that he celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is without a doubt one of the earliest patients Units of HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio resides with the human virus (HIV) protocol from 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
The director of the clinic with him at the time of Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS) say, 'because he had a cut. "
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
But there is a lot of people who are coming and doesn't know about his illness, when the virus caused the destruction of an organism and vysílil the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since the AIDS disease appeared in the world, or at least since the earliest documented cases, "means a great success, that the life expectancy of a patient, which begins in a timely and appropriate manner with the treatment, is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of Unit HIV in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and a specialist in HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of a full life and survival depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients, in whom the disease is diagnosed, the better are the ones who are taking drugs: People with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with more than 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that someone who is HIV can be diagnosed in 25 years, according to these findings "in adherence to live up to 75 years without any problems," the doctor explained in an interview.
The highlight of this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years old today.
Although the mortality rate declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS declined from 4 to 6 678 in 2007 862 in 2011 (yearbook Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco had died in 2011 255 people, and in May of this year, while 187. However since 2005 is secured universal access to antiretrovirotikům.
 - Why do people still die from preventable diseases?
 - "It seems to me that the problem is not the possibilities for access to treatment.
The way I see it, this is happening for us in the hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not run out of supplies of medicines. The problem is that patients are coming at a very late stage, because they do not know the condition of the disease, which in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds compelling figure: "Nine out of 10 patients comes when they arise some associated infection. The only thing to do is to diagnose the disease earlier and therefore should be offered on a large scale, so that we can influence the overall mortality rate more tests for the detection of the disease all persons who requests them."
In its proposal coincides with experts and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who had come to do the tests by a private laboratory just because he did it his friend, and, despite his low age with him had erupted AIDS and also suffered from cancer, Kaposi sarkomem, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I die, rather, three times a week vyřádím," they say, but it's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercise, take drugs. "
His parents still knows only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person, "enumerates Fabrizio, who accepted an invitation to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco, those who are afraid to motivate his testimony today in connection with World AIDS Day.
"Whatever they do tests. If risk, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, it's better. And if they were diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, when they will be responsible."
That's the message summarizes the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between ordinary citizens and programs for health, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds the information regarding the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places, this task is dedicated to "actually increased handing out condoms, before they gave us today will also give us the packages, one or two hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are teenagers.
"What do you want it?" is a common question full of irony and assessment from pharmacies and medical staff, school counselors, social workers, employees who want to avoid the teenager, the reporter says.
This suggested the inefficient allocation change. Whether condoms are not just behind desks, but the hundred he is located in dávkovačích goes on public restrooms, often in places where the young.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
Nor does it on them "to pay for a beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to a question if he would agree to the distribution rubbers in his district.
Takovásexualita not. It's best to make condoms available to those who already hold sex life, "he said.
Key figures in the state Jalisco

The judgment by the Court of Appeal in the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company Grupo Vitro set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, causing an unfortunate precedent for any national undertaking with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Therefore, it seems that the procedures of corporate restructuring, which allow Mexican laws, Stars and Stripes in the country despite international agreements do not apply.
The approval of the ruling issued June 15 last year a judge Harlinem Hal in a bankruptcy court for North Texas el Bravo leaves in the practice of Mexican firms without defense against the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river.
However, a judgment opens the glass door to the Supreme Court of the United States with an appeal against the three main Mexican producers of irregularities.
First of all, it must be said that while the judge in this case alleges that the creditors have to manage the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
For one thing, it would indicate the ignorance of international legal cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational companies.
In essence, the model for the unification of international trade law, which the organization by the American Law Institute determines the arbiter of the United Nations was created for this purpose.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without a vote of branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro against branches would not have reached the required majority for approval of the restructuring.
Nevertheless, the Mexican laws acknowledge this possibility.
The fact is that the company Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are a half-dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose internal debts guaranteed by the Federal Institute.
In addition, there is the fact that even after deduction of branches by the creditors - who votes against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States, that is, funds "vultures," such as Liverpool and Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional, Aurelios Capital Limited - did not have a majority.
In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.
From a different angle, the court accuses the company Vitro from the difficult situation, which has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis, which hit in the United States.
In the meantime the family firm González Sady lodges an appeal for a new assessment directly at the court of appeal to the examination was carried out in full participation, with the participation of five judges, because only three originally voted.
If he fails here, will require an appeal of the revision process more instances, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
On the case, it is significant that the court failed document sent to the Mexican Government as amicus curiae, a department in which Vitro's procedure is described in detail in the framework of the bankruptcy law, in which he points out that the company had eased by adhered to the agreements signed by both countries, the act to be confronted with Chapter 15 of the insolvency law of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country will follow the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules intended for international insolvency cases, which guarantees equality for borrowers and lenders.
The impact on both sides: The penalty for the state and company Vitro.

Cheap accommodation "HETIN" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Basketball globetrotting cheap accommodation "HETIN" Reyes was associated with this Salo's sport more than 60 years and traveled the world as a whole because of him.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories of the local basketball history, as has cheap accommodation "HETIN" Reyes.
Reyes was in 2008 before he was caught by a stroke in a wheelchair, dedicated to this sport, after more than 60 years, either as a player under the category, a player of the national basketball league Vaqueros de Bayamón BSN, owner and coach of the team in the National Basketball League, or the president Portorické basketball federation.
"I took a lot of roles, including several in the course of his life in basketball at the same time, like when I was in the 1990s, the president of the National League BSN, general manager of the national team and the president of the federation," Reyes said on a visit to the Primera Hora newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with his faithful wife, Isabel.
"Basketball has been my life."
In its statement, Reyes wasn't exaggerating.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated pictures and upomínkovými objects out of his long career, show it.
Bayamón at heart
With the greatest thrill of all those who recall his tenure in a los Vaqueros guards from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when, at the same time, celebrated 15 years as the co-owner or the owner of the team.
"That was my best years, the one I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate with a team of the los Vaqueros from 1967 eight championships, whether as the co-owner, the owner or the coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five Championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I started one šampionátem farewell - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
When the team took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader, "Reyes said.
"I remember that the coach Gene Bartow, who was here before, and by the time he taught at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me: 'I have the big trunk for you the players.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincyho, one of the best players ever Puerto Rico should.
Bartow me then recommended rozehrávače Gausseho Raymond, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember that, he said that if Mincy brings Bayamonu victory in the championship, Gausse then will contribute to the next. "
The team for the championship when los Vaqueros played Gausse, enjoy, but only at a distance because, president of the Basketball Federation has already performed in 1988.
At the time, wanted to devote full time to his functions and enjoy Mincyho position in the national team.
"I remember when we beat the United States for the first time in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we left off neighborhoods, but we should have had the bronze if it hadn't been for that of the Canadian panel, which allowed us to repeat the final clerk, "Reyes said.
The national team is the best team from the World Cup in 1990, which you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that beat the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in 1991, when we won gold and vypráskali Panamerických Games in Cuba are the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
This team should not only Gausseho, Ramona, Mincyho Rivase, Fico Lopez and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also the young men were there (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" and Francisco Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team, which might not be the perfect composition, but managed to win a gold medal, and bring great joy in Argentina in 1995, was the team of the Olympic qualification Neuquénu.
With the players on this roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players ruled out for the sake of the skirmish in the Panamerických Games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, we won the gold.
What was the best player Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico achieved at this level results such as Piculín.
Not to mention his tenure in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best portorickým coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, to which Julio Toro, Meléndez Flor, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau belong, Armandito Torres.
For the young, I would very much like the work of the Leo Arilla.
That its success in a federation consider the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous of the era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that she had the National League BSN in a single season in the early 1990s to 17 teams.
 What did you do?
There were things that I wanted to introduce as the division of youth categories according to the regions.
For example, that the guys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see a benefit in statutory certificates and courses for coaches, referees and umpires assistants.
I'm delighted.
What are you now?
As I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
