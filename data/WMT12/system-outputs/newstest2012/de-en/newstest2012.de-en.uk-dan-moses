No liberating for Tymoshenko novella by Parliament
The ukrainian Parliament refused to move, in the context of a revision of the Penal Code sections of those who, on the basis of the opposition leader, Yulia Timoshenko convicted.
The new regulation, which opens the way for the release of the detained Expremierministerin have can lead, rejected the members in the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas sentenced to seven years in prison.
The judgment is not yet final, in December, the appeal of the convicted in court to be negotiated.
Timoshenko even described the ruling as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the process of the suspicion of the bias of the Court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of the Expremierministerin was sentenced to remove from the penal code, 147 members support.
226 votes would be needed to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the libyan liberation or libyan rebellion knows about their losers.
Col. Muammar el - Qaddafi, in an unknown location in the desert, buried and without him, the war is over.
Now, only the winners to define.
As usual, this region, islamists win in the elections, the only question is what the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council is well - known to the common law Scharīʿa, which it is now, God for a certain image.
Libya would become a country with no crime, because for theft peck it in short, the hand.
Women should also thought of emancipation as soon as possible to forget any Glaubensabtrünnige are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator will society from each other feuding tribes in future the Koran united.
In short, in Libya, an order that hard to imagine here at home and, above all, hardly be desirable.
Only, our way of life, however, is not the only, and objectively, probably not the best and would change the said Libyans hardly fit.
Seen in this light, it is rather astonishing that the Muslim fighters at all of the infidels dogs help.
In their defence, may well serve only the fact that the air strikes by NATO not by any General from America, but by Allah even led the omnipotence after every successful hit was praised.
The winner in Libya? the West is not one of them.
We took in only in a gun battle, served the interests of Islam and our politicians were in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw would prefer a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen going on, which is a concern for the expulsion of the crusaders.
But even without the 's occupation of black gold to the song?
Hardly and so can the West long right of its generosity in the protection of human rights boast.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives.

The menu of a fettsüchtigen child: it not to eat for dinner and breakfast sausage
More than a third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5% of all children are overweight.
Recent opinion polls - obese children come mostly from families with ungesundem lifestyle.
So once again, how important it is for the development of a healthy people the milieu in which it grows up and the examples that surrounded him.
On the tables adipöser children sausages up to half of more often on the table than in families in which normalgewichtige children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children, on the eve of the Aufklärungsaktion under the slogan “ obesity is not a coincidence ” for chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen include sport is not just to the Lieblingsbeschäftigungen, but also the majority of today 's students, only 15 percent said that their parents are at least once a week on time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey found last year against the end of the academic year, were almost 900 children from schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year the action “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” by the general insurance company and the society Unilever is supported.
To date, the project more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8. classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible.
“ Only the half of children, for example, five times a day, in the mode of breakfast - second breakfast, lunch - Vesper - to eat for dinner, one of the main elements of a healthy diet, ” is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and the sausages for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular Frühstückszeit the family, important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic frühstücken but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families breakfast alone.
The worst was the fact that in every tenth family is not eating any breakfast.
Breakfast is the foundation stone of the day - to - day healthy diet.
The Umfragetest brought to, among other things, the day that the families of overweight children more frequently to unhealthy chips consumed.
And nearly everyone, with no regard to weight - drink every day sweetened soft drinks (70%)
While driving more than 40 per cent of children sport, but fewer than half of their parents are doing this - just 15 percent.
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the poll, made it possible for selected children (204 boys and girls from 172 13 schools), from opportunities offered after appetites and believe their own menu together.
“ What czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a long way from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many Mehlspeisen Fleischgerichte, and, of course, Süßspeisen.
“ Alarmierend is above all the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks ”, will be in the final report on the survey highlights.
At lunch, the main course, triumphed pasta just before poultry.
Pulses, liked the children almost not at all and the popularity of fish and Gemüsegerichten as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr on health
At the same time, the survey showed, however, that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if it is right for information.
“ In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten, the questionnaire following the conclusion of the aufklärenden lecture “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” filling out was, in many cases, a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy eating there, ” is in the results of the project.
For example, this was evident in the sweet Limos, where many children began to ordinary water to give priority.
The children crossed in the questionnaire, more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or sweet food to eat.
Experts say a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the initial article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert that a little bit too much food, for a start.
As anticipated, I do not have the slightest of what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of troubled characters and a seminar on how the “ place ”.
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, so more information and practical challenges before us.
But even if the course each on Saturdays and Sunday, he is still full.
This time, we debated with director exists (on the course, not a single man part), as a woman, not the ideal proportionierte figure.
And that is still the most of us.
The first is too short a neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is up to the Stylisten, broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got tips, such as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - that is, with great from the waist up, wide and narrow their waist - hip nicely and figurbetont attracts without too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between their waist and Hüften is so great that the rock or the pair of trousers really do not fit, you should at least a little bit to tailor - make their groups.
The you will certainly not regret, because well - based clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor - made Rock you feel are much better than in a “ off the, the full of high - and, in the absteht verrutscht their waist, and so on.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this lot of information and Figurtypen, I am pleased that a whole week I have time, I thoroughly over.
And yet, I fear that, given the homework assigned to it almost impossible to achieve.
Each of the Kursteilnehmerinnen received a Promi allocated, for which it is fitting attire and come up with to - Tagesbekleidung Abendrobe.
Should the current appearance, Modestil of the stars and the Figurtyp account.
I should Miranda Kerr “ attract ” that you possibly from the campaign Victoria 's secret.
In the heart of juble I, as it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, the last time well the hundred kilos of increased (okay, this is a bit of an exaggeration), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from ausschneiden magazines or on the Internet, and then printed grafisch.
In the “ Moodboard ”, as the whole result is to then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is very important, even on the side of the graphic Stylings.
The Stylist, the models are not only physically, but also creates the so - called product side in the journal (after specific target, for example, trend - handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good view.
With the information about Figurentypen angefüllte Samstagsvortrag, three visitors from the seasoned industry:
By Jan Stylisten Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the Modefotograf Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is the illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And eingeschickter Stylist can with a single Bekleidungsstück in a very different way to work.
The magic word means variability.
You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the wear jeans, a T - shirt or coat, you can have it but also on the naked body, Absatzschuhe to attract it as a dress.
It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and immediately, the whole look very different.
 “ To play with, ” he said.
Most came to me but the Council to be the following: “ first of all you have to know the rules of perfect. ”
“ Only then you can violate them, ” said Jakub.
At last, is clear to me why we all these theories pauken must what to do with what can combine and why, even if, in Modejournalen often quite another to see.
By Modeschauen.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist much more Bekleidungsvarianten have prepared, as it will finally be photographed.
So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to be prepared, at least 15 to stylen.
And also that the clothing the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all that are going to have to get the attire.
That image and sometimes Styl half the success, swiping us Jan Pokorný.
You only need to be even Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing a world star with respect.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a Stylisten more reserved.
Even celebrities is often a waste of money for (the main thing is that I, as I am is a secondary issue).
And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size sport, as he or she really needs.
It will then be only googlen with security to note that the tabloid writes, the corresponding Promi have again or declined, and so on.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to not to believe that a Stylist only to the fashion to focus on and then the clothes “ assemble needs. ”
In his work he needs, in particular, with the people communicate, which he stylt and it must be a skilled psychologist.
People assess without, and to please his opinion.
“ If we have any manager, their Kleiderschrank to sift through and beautiful pieces to supplement, then it does not eliminate the whole a cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible. ”
“ At least a few worthy things on which they recommend what you can, ” says Mario.
He showed us specifically as a so - called “ Platztasche must contain. ”
In other words, so a bag at the their waist zuknöpft and in which all the necessary Proprietäten in.
No such clear terms, such as the gap, Abroller Haareentfernen Sicherheitsnadeln or does it contain such Utensilien, such as a Nylonfaden (helping the Stylist the photography of products such as handbags or hats from), specific clips to the back of the clothing gerafft will, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are prohibited, so that the material does not break down) and, of course, Nähzeug.
So that we not only have to listen to, but also something virtually can try, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor is, it can damage the Schuhsohle, much less the outside.
Us o klebten and klebten we …
With the gap, we must not even affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So you have really sent.
Mario delighted me by my “ creation ” without restrictions praised.
The skill is not just my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we in the second weekend - Fortsetzungskurs to be told.
One thing is I have since become clear - the Styling at a professional level, is not an easy task.
V Need for speed: “ the run ” - the illegal race across America
Recession
Originally, careless driving has been hit by a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer mistake to Routinefahrt to Frühschicht.
It managed to ambitions in large part to meet, but what is the point if no one seems to want a bit more to do.
Even before he came to the Ladentische, part of the new with the subtitle “ the run high expectations. ”
He promised, but the already bejahrte Spieleserie “ Need for speed ” back in a new dimension to delay in the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen he seemed really not only one of many action - Rennspielen.
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist of the car is rising and will continue on foot.
But as it was in NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is a lot different than it had expected.
Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade - race, but on the whole, the game by some unnecessary mistakes diminished in this series are already more or less for a few years to have a presence there.
So there are really no more mistakes, but rather evidence of a in principle incomprehensible laziness of the Spieleentwickler.
The adventure begins very well.
For now, it will be in the history of introduced, whose main character Jack personal nature of certain problems; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, will it get steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York to be.
The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is in ten stages and in more than 50 individual race divided.
This means that every race at another route, and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
It has no moment the impression that game is always the same.
Some areas are still very nicely, although the technical level of chart does not have the earlier parts of the series.
That is not something I get too excited about.
But the journey through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape wirk visually very pleasant.
Now and again bring atypical elements of a bit of a change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, is a surprise to the point of view of the desert storm cripples.
In the mountains, in turn, must be to watch your step, that is not an avalanche buried.
By the way are fairly well in a row the individual race.
Only a few, but they do.
For a while we tried, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), it still expected a duel between a face - to - face with a single opponent.
And there is also the police force that a blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack of the vehicle leaves.
It is more about certain interactive including animations, in which Jack before anyone escaping and where the players must help by it at the right moment, the right button.
So it is not complicated.
It is surprising, however, that it is in the game a lot less passages, as one would expect (actually the only three).
In the end, that is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because as this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above to the elements that make the game to vary.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts.
That is to say, from today 's point of view, is pulling out of the trees, on the other hand, you could not argue that it would be bad.
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren Fahrmodell our supermarket will remain very well, although the competition could find better.
Until then, as far as all in good order.
Real problems, there are only after a certain time.
In contrast to the Kollisionsmodell Fahrmodell is not O. K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect there to be complicated deformations and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea of how the car, then, is clearly not everything is in order.
Case in point: the close Überholen or Vorbeifahren of oncoming cars “ scratches ” it in some places in the other car only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but we went into a tailspin on wild performance.
Or the Karre to scrap metal.
Thanks to the Restart - system which is nothing more, from annoying it is ever - present.
The Restarts are so resolved: if you have destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference.
Only - in every race has only five Restarts.
When they are exhausted, everything is from square one..
The Restarts are actually more of something like a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it is hard.
Sometimes does not help the Restart, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often to the same places.
Some curves, for example, in a very specific way, because otherwise if we simply do not.
Elsewhere, there is a list of the “ civilian ” cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether you as a first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly in situations annoying when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but until it gets to the cars are already in such a position that they get or delay.
And it is no matter when they arrive, everything is designed to have this situation to always close to your nose.
The opposing parties have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always in the same place from the same opponents will be overtaken again regardless of the time.
On Verrücktesten, this is the end of the game to the long bridge, one in the head.
The Kontrahent a must here seem to come hell or overtake.
And if he then had a is, then that is a, of course, the point of view, so that they initially by car a couple of times in Klump drive.
Clearly, you want the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly the pleasure the game spoiled.
And that is a shame, because, in spite of a simpler Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and at times so aktionsgeladen that they no longer know, where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what “ guilty ” of it is - the concept with 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that no boredom, pay, or something else …
A far - fetched idea is also the Wagenwechsel during the race.
We must filling stations on the road not overlook the fact that just because you cannot change the car, even though in most cases the car enough that it is.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are good for the urban areas, the strong american brand for the precise motorways and exotic super sports car for the technical journeys, for example, to the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way Spielgeschichte is also the tasks - mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities, which is in the history of it.
There is not only medals, but also own Erfahrungspunkte for the win, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to enhance the Fahrerniveau, have different open: the car started to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is, at the same time as the online role Autolog, among other things, the own achieved results compare with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
A further incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here it is: the car in an underground tunnel (I), where it was in the dark on the track for boils (say).
On the Tacho look paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h (I), but there is at once from behind a metro and drives a hard - line to scrap metal.
In our editorial we will probably still argue for a long time about whether this was a Blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether the authors to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression that, in most cases, appealing and here and there, even brilliant.
Even more galling is that some of the exciting moments Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatic.
That is particularly the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS not of any good.
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache.
In an effort to such a broad range of possible as more young audience, was a “ Soundtrack lá each of something ” - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? the feelings are more mixed.
When the game not by these totally unnecessary mistakes would diminish if we had with the held conviction able to claim that the run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But in fact, the game somehow unfinished.
In a class for pleasure, but we must be prepared for this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten eurosceptics and
“ The Lisbon Treaty, the balance between the various institutions felt from the order. ”
I would not have expected that such a hard war flares. ”
“ There will be five to six years, until the dust settles and all with their new role have become used to be, ” began girl Milena Vicenová, the czech ambassador to the European Union, quite strongly their lecture at the law school.
How seriously it the motto “ understandable and openly about Europe ”, it has shown in the first part of their lecture, in which it was able to the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that some of his editor, the faculty of the Karlsuniversität therefore have envy.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
“ Initially, according to criticism that it is too quietly - a grey official who is such a role not up, but I have to say that it has all the short, how well it is the issue.
“ He is a person of the 27 member states, it will listen patiently, communicate with and the particularly clear idea of, as it is with the EU is to continue.
The new position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question: who is the really - the European Union? what number should I call? ”, in other words, as an important step to agreement and better visibility of the EU 's policy towards states, such as China and India.
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda, in accordance with the European Union, and lives in the near future to live.
The czech presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had the financial crisis and the faltering and gas crisis summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the presidency describing it as a great Negativum, the image of the Czech Republic much damage.
The czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said, it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has still not been overcome, quite hectic.
And there is still the seven - year EU budget is approved, but the matter because of today 's economic situation is much more complicated.
Whether or not it is a slim and Thrifty budget, which industries take precedence, which countries more or less will all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which it came to Brussels: “ understandable on Europe ”.
“ If there is one thing I do not like, then it is gräuliche acronym, concepts and technical jargon, which no one understands.
How can I as citizens actually know whether Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and variable invented just bananas or whether we actually someone Quargel wants to ban.
It would have the soil of the EU also would like to be used more Czechs in european institutions.
The two - speed Europe or different prospect in
According to the EU Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics, to be, the more the negative, the positive side of the matter.
Even more galling is the poor representation by the Czechs in european institutions.
There are many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to Motivierungsbriefe to write and, last but not least, the weak support the czech side.
In addition to the successful czech presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, called the V4.
“ Do you think if a Pole or hungarian come to me and a Slovak in the vicinity, says the Frenchman next to me: “ Hey, what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4? ” and will not make a fairly acid straight face.
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a “ european ” is the idea of a Europe of the two, or even at different speeds.
“ We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the eurozone.
“ We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute a bestärkten cooperation. ”
“ For the first time, it was said that the only countries to work together who want it and those who do not want to let stand aside. ”
“ There will be more and more of these institutions, which, in the end, on a strong “ a multi - speed Europe ”, ” Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this respect, it also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues with the impact on the whole of the EU by all member states must be discussed and not just by the countries of the euro zone.

They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this is the word “ longevity. ”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although since its establishment in a century has passed.
On this basis the longevity, already their first chief visionary behind Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he was of the slogan, countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were prepared to make a little bit of thinking.
Its slogan “ think! ” has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants place should (and, at the same time, to the title of the internal magazine on IBM as long ago as 1935 began issuing).
This was also the basis of Watsen well prepared business culture.
“ For us from IBM, this long - term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to his principles and not shying away from everything else all around it to change.
The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technology, the business and society to transform.
We hope that in the next 100 years, creating even more, ” said Samuel J. Palmisano, who is now director of the company, marking the anniversary.
Educational system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its workforce, in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia, the IBM - people had, as one of the first american workers paid holidays, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and a thoughtful set for best creators and distributors.
As more sophisticated, the long - term relationship of IBM with their customers.
The company was, from the beginning, the brilliant in the Talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM on any discrimination, and could be scheduled to pick and choose.
In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman will invariably - of Virginia Rometty.
Is the only 30 years at IBM, has adopted the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and Strategiechefin.
IBM makes in the last few years, so - called online Brainstormings, from where many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas there is enough in the company is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Its strong position in the business guaranteed the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
“ From the beginning, IBM had more of the concept of an institution, as a technology company, ” said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“ IBM is not a technology company, but a firm Geschäftsprobleme through technology helps solve, ” added George Colony of - Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or it with this presence directly.
IBM in the states of their logos for family “ Big Blue ” is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and Konsultationsleistungen with incredible - purpose of servers to nanotechnology.
Of all american technology company IBM most patents and five of its staff members were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best - known inventions include, for example, ATM machines, credit cards, Finanzswap bar code, or even the Diskette.
With around $20 billion stock market value (by market capitalization) IBM during this year, the second - largest technology companies (right after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate, for example, the attempt to their own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy, or the computer IBM pc Jr.
“ Business is based on the moving forward, so we should not be emotionell to the past ”, according to Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM is not a problem, his ground on various platforms to build, and if they do not work, they also must leave.
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls.
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM committed to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in each one - fifth.
It was still in 1990 with a hardware fünfzigprozentigem share more than most.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets at a value of $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of the future technologies.
In these investment goes IBM after 2008, as the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world fegte.
IBM also was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, in the midst of the Great Depression of its large scale of investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today 's crisis emerges unscathed.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig by 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is: everything can change - not only the values.
It is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis.
IBM history: from Käseschneider to Weltallflügen
The one hundred years ago in New York - based IBM society (International Business Machines) initially a very complicated names - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM, she only 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for future society IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history until the 1980s of the 19th century.
You had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on the registration of work and, at the end of the day.
The architect of the new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board of directors.
And it was the Flint, the head of the Konkurrenzfirma Thomas J. Watson stopped him, so that this in the management of the company helped.
Those leaders, the founder of IBM in the shadow of Watson 's ideas based invincible and today, the culture and identity of the company.
Watson started the company in 1952.
IBM, began, as the name suggests, in the creation and distribution of all sorts of machines for trade - of sausage and Käseschneidern, to coffers.
In the first four years of Watson, he led the company doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was for the company so essential that it whole forty years in Chefsessel sat, only then he was by his son, Thomas Watson junior replaced.
Under the leadership of IBM began in the development of artificial intelligence to work and also developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped engineers and computer from IBM NASA flights into space to head - on Merkur and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of the man on the moon.
Meanwhile, developed by IBM in 1964 the first Rechnerfamilie with equal Rechnerarchitektur - the number of IBM System / 360.
A classic pc, the computer - standard that time, certain came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later his Rechnerproduktion veräußerte IBM to China 's Lenovo society, on the other hand, they bought the Konsultantenteil the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose now fully in the business of Consultingleistungen and high - value - added services.
The strategy, which IBM in the last three years, pay is the concept of “ smarter planet. ”
It is the intention of technologies to wise way in so far not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transportation and Städteverwaltung.
In the commercial sector, IBM introduced recently, the platform “ smarter commerce ”, the dealers to help the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
1932 - based IBM has a branch in the former Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and here is a top team of world - class that, with the technology of the Stimmerkennung.
Darina Rychtářová about her husband 's pension untreuen:
Iveta - this idiot you can keep you, I want him more.
Darina Rychtářová (53) says now is over!
After their spouses Josef Rychtář (53) by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) to their lovers, remained Darina still hope that Josef rosaroten from his dream to wake up and come home.
But now it is finally over, and with the patience for life, it has clear rules.
“ Josef can come home, but not more than my partners, ” said D. Rychtářová.
As the singer Darina Rychtářová I. Bartošová in their own homes had offered refuge, she would have been probably were not even in the dream, as with her husband.
As Iveta at their urging after 30 days again and back to Říčany, Josef was with them.
In fact, it even well - known publicly that they love.
With the time resigned Darina that yes, it seemed as if even with her untreuen man to win, but now it gave him once dismissing.
Rychytář, it does not matter who is sleeping with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová it will in the future should leave, then he will be at home will not open arms.
“ He is the biological father of my dreams and if his days in our common home to decide on, then I will not hinausjagen. ”
“ But not as beloved, verirrter old donkey, but as a human being, to which I have certain ties have betrayed, ” Mrs Rychtářová; they said, however, that they had he already emotionell separately and is alone in mutual decency.
The fact that he Darina the back door locked, Josef so far with dignity.
“ I respect the decision of my wife. ”
“ I stand with Iveta together, nothing is changing. ”
“ My wife wants a paper before and I respect that. ”
“ The company is ongoing, I care about the repairs, the garden, the land, I make the shopping. ”
“ With Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we share is not, ” said J. Rychtář (the newspaper Blesk.)
If Darina wants to seek a new love, then he wants to not prevent them.
“ We sleep with each other, so I don 't care, whether they have a friend, or who that is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I was in love with Iveta and that is why I will take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: what 's with you?
If the men calling on some typical female vices, then shake it would invariably some paint from the sleeves.
Women, you would see in the following lines, in which a few Unsitten review, which the men the blood wallen?
Einkaufssucht
Raises them their s husband, einkaufssüchtig?
You have to be at least one reunite on a weekly basis?
Do you like to shop and in operations there must also be a bit more?
Then it is in your case is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware and try their Einkaufslust reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, which Ms believes it has already, in search of a well - seated Oberbekleidung only through a Kleidergeschäft to bummeln and not all (in all kinds of Farbkombinationen) in the booth to try?
Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby, for men, it is often the pure hell.
Consider it just as often, her husband said, it is better you out there …
Constant discontent
“ I am not getting too fat? ”
“ I should at least five kilos of decline, should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik? ”
“ I Gefalle you? ”
They sounds familiar?
Yes?
That will take you to the women, the obsession of them are, how they look.
That is by no means that you will be allowed, but many men respond allergic to when their Mrs constantly about their appearance upset.
The stronger sex is agreed, with increasing frequency of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a tilting at windmills.
The spills Fliesen windows, and dust, the Wanne scheuern - and it at least twice a week.
Berate you with their partner, because he once again with dirty shoes on the clean Fliesen trample, chastising the children, because it just gescheuerte Waschbecken dreckig once again, and because the Glastür on Wohnzimmerschrank again fingerprints, which the whitening so much trouble?
Should you under this kind of “ Devianz ”, then you should know that there is no exaggeration, and the order and cleanliness in family life not in the first place.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can at the end of the day, the mutual relations and, above all, the peace in the family.
Sticheln
“ Dirty Turnhosen come in the Wäschekorb. ”
“ You want the old socks really tomorrow again attract? ”
“ A watery throwing is not simply on the floor. ”
If her partner such a tirade is exposed, you may not be surprised to see him at the Palme.
Clearly, this is not bad, but they want to do just that everything is in order.
If the men know this, then took the women may not be as much to meckern.
Gossip
Some women like to clap and tratschen, as is behind the backs of getuschelt or even be vilified or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relations, therefore, they would like to such issues by, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think any of us has a harmless bit of gossip to camp.
Believe me, this is all women.
But that is not to be confused with the major Klatschtanten calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, who are all in their area and contempt for the particularly Frauenkollektive represent a significant danger.
Jágr and Voráček gave Philadelphia with their Assistenzen to victory
The Eishockeystürmer Jaromír Jágr Montagsspiel had in the NHL with two Assistenzen large share: 5 - 3 victory at Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and this result, again produktivster czech players in the NHL.
Beneficiaries of the overview of the neununddreißigjährigen Eishockeystars was in both cases, Claude Giroux, which is still a assistance and added to the best players of the matches was declared.
Two Assistenzen in the same game, also Jágr 's players Jakub Voráček.
Jágr said after the match he had against journalists, Giroux a great night.
“ Before the game, I told him, that he is now a hat. ”
I had the feeling in some way. ”
“ Now and then fill a such a feeling, ” declared Jágr, after its action Giroux even in the case of the first shot of the Flyers a gateway.
A bit later, the second hit “ a czech track. ”
Voráček - won behind the gate of the Hurricanes Puck and presented it between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the Abpfiff the first third of the Heimspieler Patrick Dwyer a Short - Hander, but the second was one - third then again the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr reached his third hit, then drew the Wayne Simmonds shot on the fourth.
“ I love to play with him. ”
“ I do not want to say that he is the best player in the league, but certainly, he is one of the best three ”, paid tribute to his Jágr Center.
“ I would be in the lives of not occur to me that I would like to end my career with such an ice - hockey player playing together, as with him. ”
“ I am pleased about this huge. ”
“ I am raising my game on. ”
“ All the years in the NHL, my players their game on me and now turns the tables in order, ” schmunzelte Jágr.
Carolina made game even more to the tragedy - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who is from a Strafschuss hold, in a door.
Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he was successful, there are two against one.
“ Goody goody acted Pronger still in our region. ”
“ He got off the Puck, I took on and (Read) led to more distant amongst these groups result. ”
“ I tried to see him and I am glad that it has been working, ” described Voráček recent hits the game from his point of view.
This victory, Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Jaroslav Abwehrspieler Montreal Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and Vitorino in the second half due to a violation of the bare - chested.
The Candiens losing in addition to her know Beck also their leadership in a unverloren Penalty - shooting 2 - 3.
One of the Strafschüsse Tomáš Plekanec could not convert.
More than the lost points schmerzten the coach of the home team is the high illness shortfall in the defensive - the game they played only with five Abwehrspielern to end.
“ That is a bad thing. ”
“ The game we play with only a single experienced players, to the end of the rest were young players. ”
“ But there is nothing so that we must be ready, ” said Jacques Martin.
“ Any change in wave after wave of others and we had nothing. ”
“ We had the game easier and the Puck from our third rausbringen. ”
There was still room, ” said P. K. Subban, one of the Abwehrspieler.
The Czech gate - keepers Ondřej Pavelec rejected 30 shots for Tampa Bay, and was so essential to the 5 - 2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, a series of five defeats concluded, had five different shooter share.
Development of higher fares since 1989.
In 1989, there have been only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agents sold at the time, above all, only travel in the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the West, at that time only on the select few.
And so went czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the German Democratic Republic (GDR)), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Korean Peninsula, Crimea, on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary to use it.
An exception was the light of the period from 1962 to 1972, when we travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia a pro - western course and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist times it was that it is not even citizens of the soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was, in the context of the socialist countries to travel freely.
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union to, then took a so - called Einladungsbrief, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, the travel agents also travel to the West, but then had to be huge queues at, or even in the hot - water bottle in the travel agency sleep, or at least good “ well - known ” in the travel agency.
Even so, the issue has not gone.
The so - called Devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the west, has only been “ politically reliable ” people granted to the other could not travel.
The czech currency was not free umtauschbare currency without Devisenzusage, it would be impossible to have the necessary financial resources (western) currency for a trip to the West finding.
The Czechs weither therefore spent most of their holidays at home, it 's no surprise that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit still continues.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989, followed by a Reiserevolution the Czechs in the foot.
Until 1989 during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things were spent the Czechs in the last year of their Auslandsferien 4.5 million in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is now no longer is aware, is the fact that you are currently in the most popular holiday destination enjoys the Czechs - Croatia to 1989, is not being able to go, because it is part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the last century to the Devisenpflicht in neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which is a huge wave of Kurzbesuchen above all to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken able for a long time, of their movements in the West simply cannot get enough of, everyone wanted to at least a few days there have been.
So slept the czech tourists in travel to Paris in the tent city in the park, because who would have the money to stay in one of the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by the Czechs then was a with tins, beer and Dauerwurst etc. vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the Czech - free umtauschbaren crown after decades could be our tourists the western currency finally free to buy.
Our standard of living and thereby also Durchschnittsgehälter rose, in 1997 in another important moment einmündete.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 regularly travels through the charter flights to prepare the air travel, thanks to the possibility of Mengenrabatte negotiate, than in the past, incredibly cheap.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments on all of the advanced countries in the world, as the travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the “ post - velvet ” travel has occurred in 2000, when thanks to high demand the first direct charter flight in an exotic country handles - to Thailand.
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel each year in exotic countries.
Another important moment in the era of the “ post - revolutionary ” development marked, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirements for czech tourists on, which is the country most definitely in the advanced countries in the world have brutalized.
In 2008, spent the Czechs, for the first time more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in its history, they spent for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt destinations, including the cost at more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita.
The general meeting to find a new chairman - again threatened a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and there is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association (Czech FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know.
To this day, there are still no agreement on the electoral law would be elected.
And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successor.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek of his role, and his colleagues in the departure of inviting had come to an agreement and a strong person to find the football to follow.
Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old spat between the two Verbandskammern once again, which is not on a joint candidate can agree.
This was clearly on September 16, as the new chairman should be chosen.
The delegates to the general meeting were free of the Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who in the Vollsammlung actually vote - are only the statutory representatives or with a power - wielding officials.
In this one point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in Vollmachtbasis not admissible.
The disputes in the electoral law, however, continue to take in.
The executive committee did not have more clarity on the issue, in whose meetings - regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the ideas about the choice of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: how can we in the third round, a stalemate to avoid?
“ The bone of contention is the question of whether it is in line with the statutes of action, or whether a very different model must be found, ” said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice - chairman of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round one candidate, the greater the prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is said to be ready to compromise on that one candidate wins out, the higher the number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Republic, in turn, is on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count at least a two - thirds majority.
“ Then, the two Vorrunden make no sense, this way, all the Zweikammerkonzept in question, ” Svoboda understands the objections of the moravian side, the best there is, the electoral law not tweaking, but under current statutes to choose.
The true surprisingly Tomáš Paclík to, even if it is apparent that the statutory election rules of all the candidates most likely to be Pelta meet.
“ My wish is that as far as possible after the statute is elected. ”
“ So that no nonsensical Ersatzvarianten up, as in the last general meeting, ” said the owner of the Victoria (clubs) Plzeň which, for the first time, standing in his opinions and, above all, to Pelta abgrenzte.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, will be in the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidates in the future will work constructively.
“ The possible qualifications of the national team for the Euro today would be sure to reassure the people. ”
“ If the football until the euphoric wave ride, it is also the willingness to cooperate more, ” said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience and both at professional, and regional level.
Rajchl there is more circumspect.
“ I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent. ”
“ It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules to witness the “ baseline ”. ”
“ That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded. ”
“ I hope, however, that the common sense prevails in the end, ” said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is not.
Some negotiations must be supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification at all will be completely.
The Charterflugzeug, amongst other things and Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice fly should, in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder do not start and so it sought urgently for a Ersatzvariante, as a part of the executive committee, but are still on the site of the Barrage - Hinspiels.
At the end of the day, then surely the meeting at ministerial level is essential to the supposedly it on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands the country would like to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: benefits of the Czech Vertrauungswürdigkeit football and the forthcoming general meeting of the czech ČSTV, the sport after the financial problems of Sazka 's new direction.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of the chairman, because it is not a suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting of a strong candidate would have picked up, all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) met, he would do not relate to the fight for this position of concessions.
“ When there is a good candidate, then I would strive for it and to the election. ”
“ But in the current situation, we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find, ” said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík, into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, that the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the function of the chairman of just one year plans to exercise, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary shareholders' meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in the Fußballgeschehen is involved.
“ With some eligible people in person. ”
“ Hard to believe that some people have said that they want to do is not currently with the czech football.
 “ Those views would like to have changed, ” he said.
Most of all, disturbs Paclík supposedly Pelta 's link with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands Berbr novel, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind - the - scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to Delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings to influence.
For Paclík is, therefore, that it is unacceptable that Pelta, held the position of the chairman.
“ In his victory would today 's state einkonserviert and in the czech football is not making any progress at all. ”
“ The support provided by Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, football twice badly, ” said Paclík.
Now he is also essential that Pelta 's name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to identify in a Korruptionsaffaire fell from the Pelta, however, emerged with impunity.
“ I do not know what the prestige of a victory by the Pelta (tsch.) football should get involved. ”
“ And as we would in the eyes of the FIFA and UEFA off, ” said řekl Paclík, his former utterance, “ he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will ”, but something more coolly.
In the Donnerstagwahl Paclík should win, he would, however, be a future cooperation with Pelta quite imagine.
Just as thinks another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the General Assembly in October had supported with a fiasco.
“ He (Pelta) would be the first, on which I would go. ”
“ He has great ability. ”
“ I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team. ”
“ But I do not think that it is capable of, the association as a manager. ”
“ I caught my nose but not in issues that I do not understand, ” said Paclík in September that raised eyebrows – that he was behind the dismissing the Schiedsrichterkommission with Luďěk Macela at the top, was the Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the Verbandsvorsitzenden increased.
And holding up his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen which, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league.
“ I have the power to do so, something in the Fußballmilieu to change and to a certain degree of cultivation of this. ”
“ In order to limit the influence of interest groups, which tend to disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen to influence what by in - bound descends into situations, ” led to the Paclík, no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta 's leader, Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the czech Olympic Committee, with the help of the political leaders to live that more money from Lotteriesteuer in the sport.
“ This is one of the key things, to which the new chairman should pay attention to. ”
“ If it on the taxation of Glückspielen, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but there must be clear where the money is going, ” he said.
His connection to the club Paclík Pilsner is also not a handicap in, even though he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR need to “ bipartisan ”.
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec Rajchl, with the Prague Dukla.
“ This is not ideal. ”
“ It makes my opinion but also not much point in my shares in the club to a Drittperson Pilsner hypocritical to after a year and a half back again, ” said the Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, the stalemate in future ausschlössen.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt Miroslav Pelta, namely that he would do in the event of his election campaign for the new statutes FAČR gets in the future disputes over the electoral law, rule out.
The official from Jablonec is before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in the event of success of the Czech selection sure.
Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided at the last moment, in the election before the last general meeting to participate in the two - month pause it might help to put his ideas on the leadership of the football to defend and in a wider context.
“ People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president on Thursday is known. ”
“ He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone who is headed, says the man who, in particular, with the club Jablonecer is linked, but also many years in Sparta, and in the executive committee.
Also, he has said that it has sufficient experience, the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria is responsible, in the days of Ivan Hašek.
“ Unfortunately, in the shareholders' meeting in June approved statutes, which do not fully, as it had all assumed.
If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we should have, as of September, already had a chairman, ” Pelta said.
The review of the most important document of the residents' association he used as a sweetener to the delegates.
“ I should be president, then I will accept the me personally and I am personally prepared to take responsibility if it does not work. ”
“ It is a matter of principle, without which it can be, ” Pelta said.
In addition, he did not try to stand up to his opponent.
Earlier, he had announced that he can work with Jindřich Rajchl imagine, because of his legal education recognises and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík, it has been for a long time, which, in turn, no dry thread to Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already in some successes. ”
“ His attacks were herabsetzend, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign. ”
“ Also doubt now many of his true nature, ” Pelta addressed his opponent, the most faithful to his proclamations remain, for which it has in September.
In his view, the most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the hallmark of Czech football.
“ I would try to do all Affairen to end - of fog Bohemians, up to the Nachhallen the Korruptionsskandals last year. ”
“ Afterwards I on negotiations with the private and public sector to sufficient funding for the whole of football ”, said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football no human cleansing would mean.
“ I would have to start with the monitor all workers get to know, ” he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the length of the anarchy understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain.
“ If there is really the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we will get over that. ”
“ The football needs credibility and that wins it will only back when he finally has a new Leader ” Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day Funktionärskarriere optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the former vice - chairman of Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim of vermiesen.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard to begin.
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual Fußballbereiche.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA to improve, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun.
“ As Chairman, I would like to football as a whole. ”
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the Nationalauswahl, professional football, up to and including the Leistungsfußball for young people. ”
“ This is not to say that I want to do it all, ” said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
“ I am a Teamspieler, and therefore the powers of the executive committee, so that every member of a certain area. ”
And I will work hard so that the football in each segment at moving forward. ”
There were many enchanted, because they, rather than the work of other to criticise now itself really began to work hard, ” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the Fußballbewegung have considered, no longer standing.
“ I know that I am working 20 hours a day. ”
“ But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, I did not constantly put spokes and every step I make, in question, ” he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated.
“ A lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise there other. ”
“ The trust is that we should not waste, ” he said.
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work, which he suffered Hašek has begun.
“ In two years we have a great deal of work done and I will now not simply throw away. ”
“ It processes have been launched, the only in a few years to play out, and I would hate to see that they stop someone, ” he said, and now his concerns to saying that, in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
“ I believe in systematic approach and that is something that Mirek Pelta not. ”
“ Behind him, especially people who made the football would make that he only for exclusivity is there. ”
I may be some of the accused, but not that I would be biased. ”
“ I am trying to do, to be objective. ”
“ I want football for all of them, because it then all is well and not only the specially selected, ” said Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that it was only a chairman of the Czechs.
“ Even if some people claim the opposite, I really did, what is best for Moravia to do. ”
“ For example, it is time to consider whether the League is in a czech and part of a moravian should divide, whose winners will each in the first League aufstiegen. ”
“ Then it might not happen that today only three Moravian clubs in the league play, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem, ” said Rajchl.
Because it is now up to the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the fight for the office of the chairman, has joined dares Rajchl not to assess his chances that he is elected.
“ I feel a strong support in the chamber, the Czech me on her vice - chairman has chosen and now recognises that clear success stand behind me, ” led Rajchl with saving tens of millions of kronor disadvantageous for contracts, the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the Lotteriegesetz as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association of not in a single comes together.
Whilst Pelta says, “ he was disqualified from the outset, the czech football with greater confidence ”, he thinks of the second - Paclík rivals for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
“ No one can question in Pilsen in just a year ago, has done an excellent job. ”
“ He should be elected, he would probably things continue Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personnel in the commissions it would obviously not fundamentally change. ”
It would make things certainly not in his favour altered just want, ” judging from Rajchl on its rival.
Europe 's most beautiful pools
Leap into the blue
Julie Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo - visual intrusion, Prunkpools in Budapest: who travel through Europe, may be a result of see - and after a Städtetour or a wandering the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.
A book shows where promotion in the water on the most beautiful.
If iris Meder over the past year and a half to Recherchereise was, one in her luggage not: their swimming.
Rücklings on the water, lying, they looked high in elaborately shaped domes, they swim marble - Putten, contrary to the most Beckenrand they waited, and staunte on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Like a bad, they took it in great haste in their Notizbuch on - with wissenswerten details on the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools erkundete Architekturhistorikerin Meder in this way, and it is now just in her book “ Badefreuden ”: Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic Badepaläste in the Black Forest, “ hardcore ” Betonbauten in Taunus.
By 13 countries, it introduced its “ trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe ”: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland they visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each year a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year - old german is a real Badekultur - Enthusiastin.
With sport have little hat on, says Meder - just in the water is different.
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln Chlorgestank and have to accept, while the smell of Jogger betörenden Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy already in the park to listen to.
“ I have one day asked why swimming pools are always so must be ugly, ” says the Meder living in Vienna.
“ So I began to fine pools to collect. ”
Mains doubled architecture
Geplätscher in Sprungbecken and essential oils sauna - the Wellnessfaktor in bathrooms is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders of trouble, can be a real Schwimmhallen Augenschmaus: “ instead of a Fußbodens bathrooms has a surface. ”
“ On the one hand, it is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the entire building. ”
All doubles look: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, Sprungbretter.
The “ kleinformatige Bildband Badefreuden ” gives to 190 Wissenswertes sides on the architecture and cultural history of historic promotion - oases but above all an appetite for a leap in the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pools Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100 - year - old Széchenyi - it was a bad in Budapest nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc - Tapolca), as well as an Thermalbad, whose basin alkalihaltigem were filled with water and is in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, on the other hand, provide many districts Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city, in a Außenpool Bads in St. Anton on the covered Arlberg look - and in the Dampfbad: there is a window, from which it the flow on the ski runway can monitor.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool - design expects beach in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquadome looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
From three to open the peel dampft it in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the pool - Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smelt sulphur, after the Árpád - bath in the hungarian Békescsaba smell it is so much for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe, in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell is coming from the alkali - hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters, almost black, and whose silt a stain on the skin, as soon as it is sliding into the pool, a promotion - a special kind of.
In one place, iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing, however, also disappointed: the free - and in the czech Sonnenbad bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, it was a abgesperrtes terrain.
The 1902 - designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bad has since been closed.
As Meder look verwitterten through the window of the red - and - white - yellow building Jugendstil - raised her, like weeds between the Fliesen has grown.
The drop has addressed it, on the other hand, turning in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais made in Wildbad bad.
Three construction schedules, this bad already; discover you can not only neoromanische elements from moments of its construction in 1844, but also a maurische warehouse in the Alhambra - style, in 1900 added.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais made the Lieblingsbad the pool knowledge iris Meder - and not just because they had originated in the Black Forest.
“ It is quite an achievement, as various Baustile at such a wonderful unity to merge, ” says Meder.
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in Thermalpool appear to be beside the point.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank leaves raw materials business look
By Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank is their business in agricultural commodities?
After mirror - ONLINE information - Josef Ackermann has a working group responsible for the consequences of speculation for the world 's poor.
In January by the president of the company himself will then draw the consequences.
Hamburg
For the Bundesbürger it is clear: 84% of Germans find it, according to a study is not acceptable, that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize speculate.
Two - thirds of respondents are calling for even that Deutsche Bank and other lenders from the trade off, because the problems of the world 's poorest people.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid - October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices, and the banks therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign by the defender is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank, head Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, Rohstoffwetten intended for traders to hedge price.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to to investigate allegations and said, “ there is no business worth, the reputation of the german bank to put at risk. ”
According to information from looking into a mirror ONLINE international working group is currently the accusations of the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year, will the consideration to be completed, then the results of the Board of the Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, as to how it will be handled.
At the end of January to the top of the Bank will say what consequences it attracts.
May, in the end, a reduction in the Rohstoffgeschäfts, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkering with his image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: “ the betting on rising food prices shows a particularly vivid, as reckless banks today the common good. ”
Ackermann is the ultimate Bankenlobbyist now particular duty.
“ The german bank must all sites from its portfolio, in which money for betting on food prices will be used, ” Bode said.
“ Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the german bank is concerned. ”
The insight of Ackermann is at first glance a surprise, however, it is clear that, by the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from the office of a perfect picture.
On Monday, the german bank, announced that the CEO is different than planned not to its Board of change.
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve its image.
And possible reductions he needs is unlikely to do so, after all of his successor.
Half of raw materials would terminate plants
Foodwatch, the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, the survey published Bode, for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November 1001 people interviewed.
Just 11 per cent of therefore believe that it is legitimate to the german bank facilities offering in the price of food bets.
Many customers would also personal consequences if they know that their bank to such complicit: every second, according to the poll, all facilities, in which money in the commodity speculation.
43% would acquaintances of such a bank would not do so, 49% to think about their bank accounts, and another to institute change.
21er House in Vienna
The pavilion umgezogene
By Mrs Wiensowski
A Architekturgeschichte highs, lows and happy endings — the austrian Weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels in 1958, was won by prices in Vienna for the museum, was empty and verkam.
It is now as Ausstellungshaus re - opened.
If of modern post geschwärmt will clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, the typical of the belief in the technological progress, then the austrian pavilion of the architects of Karl Schwanzer for Brussels' World Expo in 1958 and famous is a good example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Grand Prix d 'Architecture for his easy and float - looking - glass - steel construction.
The building has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so well known that the and at the next World Expo austrian pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally renowned.
His Ausstellungsbau planned as a temporary pavilion had been following the exhibition in the swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof established in 1962, and converted to a museum of the 20th century - opened the 1920s “ House ” it was called.
Lift the building but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
It was, however, so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion rebuilt, he is now “ 21er House ” and will, in the future, as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum, which the House, where the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in every respect.
Won the restart Agnes Husslein - Arco, 2007, the new director of the austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein - Arco, qualified art historian, with considerable career including the young people as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of the modern era than Gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern by, they provided public funds and private Sponsorengelder and established the use.
Except Gegenwartskunst should the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous Foundation issued a café and a bookshop, and it should be a Bürohaus had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the operation was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work.
Not only because it Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive converted and extended and won the competition, but also because he is in Schwanzer in the technical Vienna University and has studied the pavilion for him a “ incredibly important ” was the ground when he felt “ almost every weekend, ” the exhibitions considered.
He knew the Ur - draft, and he was very familiar with the problems of the building, which at its transfer to Vienna and its Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
At this restructuring, there was far greater problems: the building was “ a Energieschleuder, ” says Krischanitz.
The Fensterprofile the outside glass of have changed, glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas set up and the Glasdach by special security glass.
Kältebrücken - damaged are more or been replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished.
Two Untergeschosse made room for the new use, a abgesenkter Lichtgraben between House and road will ensure the Belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer - pavilion.
The original Außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz - Farbton removed.
And the theatre is even more closely as it used to be.
All under strict supervision of Denkmalbehörde and with a small budget.
“ Often had a material are found, it is good and proper, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked, ” says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss.
Despite all the pressures, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy.
It is difficult, with the pavilion, “ the came from Brussels, ” Krischanitz recently said that a typical “ rates - in - the - City - history. ”
So a architecture is “ always in the wrong place ” and wanted to give a proper still “ awareness ”.
In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is a stroke of urban happened: the swiss garden is emerging around the entirely new planned “ Hauptbahnhofsquartier ”, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may be happen: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz - construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city for a neighbourly location within the swiss garden.
Rail plans winter - crisis package in millions
The train has a crisis plan beats the Zugausfälle in the winter to prevent.
Not to be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against winterbedingte Zugausfälle and delays are Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report this year about 70 million euros in addition.
The “ picture ” newspaper reported, citing a preliminary konzerninternen crisis plan by 2015, are investing a total of around 300 million euros.
That should better availability of vehicles and rail network in extreme Witterungen.
Is planned, among other things, a doubling of the internal and external members of staff for the Schneebeseitigung on Bahnanlagen and platforms to 16,000 people.
Goal is platforms to Betriebsbeginn and 90 per cent of the betriebsnotwendigen course within four to five hours of snow and ice - free.
Two months ago had rail head Rudiger hole after a conducted high level visits to government and industry from cancellations and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the railways in the movement of significant problems, since it has, among other things, on difficult weather conditions of reserves is lacking.
So many new suburban wait for years for a licence from the rail Federal Office.
Moreover, there is a delay in the extradition of ICE train link - trains.
The track also makes for years to create that they axes of ICE train link - trains significantly more often in the workshop to investigate after a ICE train link in Cologne a Achsenbruch Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays Millionenstrafe in the United States
After the brouhaha surrounding head Josef Ackermann is new hardships from the United States: the Deutsche Bank has a Millionenbuße pay.
As if the problems at home for the german bank is not enough, catching up on the industry giants, now, his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million ($106 million euros) to rows about the collapse of five big banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of Hypothekenpapieren.
The NCUA Finanzmarktregulierer raises a number of big banks, credit unions with false promises to buy the products are prone to; they have played down the risks.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis sharply in value and pulled the banks with deeper.
“ We are pleased that we are able to resolve the matter, without the parties tried to go ”, said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted with the comparison are not to blame.
The same applies to the Citigroup, which is the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz, welcomed the courtesy of the two key.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and jumps in bankruptcies, in order to protect Kundeneinlagen.
The NCUA tried to damage the multi - billionaire replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator has other big banks and iron in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
In the Hypothekenpapieren in question is known as mortgage - backed securities.
Those are Hauskredite.
When the housing bubble burst in 2007, this was a variety of financial firms are fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events a few years ago, blowing the banks are currently in the United States, a stiff wind.
Investors and regulators have numerous appeals, in order to receive compensation or wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the largest Klagewelle.
It raises 18 international banks, the two government - Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in Hypothekengeschäften to the tune of around $200 billion to have.
The german bank must be a complaint from the FHFA, this is about several shops worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
Regulators have demanded that the Frankfurt for “ substantial losses ” music, but without a precise figure.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as the founder and explained to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in an IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invested heavily in the it companies IBM.
Since March, he shares with a value of more than $10 billion purchase.
Until now, the great american investor Warren Buffett, always said, not in it and computer companies to invest, as the long - term development of the companies only bad forecast.
Now, he has, however, the company reports of IBM read and opinion on investment in the industry changed.
He had much earlier must understand that IBM with services anbiete and computer systems for the it department of other companies beschaffe.
An investment by Warren Buffett is a Ritterschlag in the world of finance.
For this reason, it is the cornerstone of IBM now “ Sir IBM ”.
Because Buffett revealed now in the US Wirtschaftssender CNBC that he since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion dollar bought.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM graduated with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that not even IBM has something of the commitment know.
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis for proper ensured profits.
“ You have a great job, ” said Buffett, on the strategy.
IBM, for some time on the lucrative it Services as the operation of data centres.
Of the more than 100 - year - old Computerpionier also provides software and advice and powerful Firmenrechner.
Buffett had Technologiefirmen so far more shunned.
He says he only invest in companies whose business he can understand.
Instead, Buffett, such as a Frachteisenbahn, in a lubricant maker or Maschinenbauern.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly 80 subsidiaries also in addition to own shares in a number of large companies such as Coca - Cola or the Munich re, the former Munich moved.
The 81 - year - old girl was in the 1960s, the small Textilfirma Berkshire Hathaway accepted and it with wise investments has become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, be modest lifestyle.
It is, therefore, for many investors in the world a Kultfigur.
Be almost unmistakable sense for money - making him the nickname of “ Oracle of Omaha ”.
Following the news of Buffett, investments, the IBM - share vorbörslich at a rate of 1%.
“ Big Blue ”, as IBM is known, is on the stock market as a whole, more than $20 billion worth, and that along with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, he wants to but not enter.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is real
Following the discovery of the “ Zwickauer cell ” doubt turkish media in the german state under the rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “ bloody ideology ”, which is now again auflebe.
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a greek entrepreneurs from 2000 to 2006, an extreme right - wing background.
This news will be in Turkey and within the deutschtürkischen population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many german - türken in a long time totgeglaubtes spectre: since the burning in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with more extreme right - wing background against Turks.
In Germany, xenophobia, however, was never in question.
The right - wing extremist network uncovered reveals, however, proportions, whose dimension still is not clear.
“ The bloody Lebt ideology back on? ”,, the Internetausgabe the turkish newspaper “ Haberturk. ”
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, pointed out that one of the perpetrators of a V - man of Verfassungsschutzes may have been, and expresses concern that german authorities in the extreme right - wing swamp might be involved.
Calmly responded the turkish community of Germany: it reminded the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racial violence.
Just two weeks earlier, the turkish community in Berlin, together with german and turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the german - turkish Anwerbeabkommens thought.
In joyous colors was the co - existence staged as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, as the reporting of certain turkish media: “ Germany gift on the 50th ” is the title of an article in the turkish Haber Internet platform “ X ”, to which the background to the series of Will.
The Deutschlandausgabe the “ Hürriyet ” we cannot take this spiritual connection.
“ It starts to stink, ” is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines the fact that people have been murdered, the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done.
Most are critical in deutschtürkischen forums, the actions of the police and their later Fahndungserfolg discussed.
Why the german authorities not long ago came to my mind is, in extreme right - wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors.
Some people, at least rhetorically to drastic measures prepared: “ will continue to live here, it remains the migrants do nothing other than the self - defence and the armed forces. ”
“ This will probably be the best self - defence. ”
“ The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany, ” writes, “ selenium. ”
What it means, if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, shows the attacks of Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Brandruine Solingen is deeply rooted in the german and turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance in right - wing violence could result.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we - feeling on the turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the turkish press at the time, in particular, the failure of the german policy after the attacks, criticizes, Helmut Kohl refused, the survivors of Mölln to visit.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the turkish President, at his funeral in Cologne but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time in his speech on how many charges but Turks.
As berechne is the value of a people for the level of its very.
The current reporting the turkish media shows once again how deeply the suspicion of many Turk from Bremen in the abandonment of rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re - evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany needs this time it openly.
The Skandalbank by Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS during the financial crisis was nearly bankrupt and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.
Now it is a german.
It had thus Axel Weber is certainly not intended.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July 2013 honourable, that he almost as a spectacular new job candidates: Verwaltungsratspräsident UBS, the swiss banking - unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt.
Axel Weber was public, praised the Switzerland whether their beauty and the UBS whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.
“ The UBS has the Turnaround managed ”.
“ I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel. ”
But already in September, it was clear that things in an entirely different way.
A trader of UBS in London all security systems of the bank violated and around 1.7 billion euro gambling found themselves.
- UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.
The Verwaltungsratspräsident since then as the UBS is also wounded and all ask: when will finally come Axel Weber?
Already, it became known that Weber 's February 2012 to discuss.
And the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May, not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday told us.
For Axel Weber will be tough.
He is not a banker, rather Ökonomieprofessor and central bankers and have an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he will take over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just once again has demonstrated that they have long the title of “ Europe 's biggest Skandalbank deserves. ”
Because the UBS has one huge - until recently, it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides, on the other hand, for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once proud swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften swiss Vermögensverwalters they had combined with ambitious targets: you also wanted to, the investment banking business is a very large number.
So managed the UBS in 2007, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollar high - net - worth customers more money than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, was it as an investment bank in the league of the world 's largest banks huddle.
That made sense.
The former banker and subsequent long - standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans auditions told: “ my students, I have the UBS then always as a good bank. ”
“ From today 's perspective, one wonders, how could I just so wrong? ”
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it would appear that something substantial schieflief in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back until that as hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers.
A few months later, suspecting it, how he had taken.
The Investmentsparte the bank had with sub - papers gambling found themselves and had to write off billion.
In order to absorb the UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of as many as 13 billion francs.
For investors, it was, in fact, however, what, on some until shortly before the nose gerümpft: a non - transparent asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an arab sovereign wealth funds, so the silence was that they did not even his name.
But this was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there were worse.
The bank had to announce new Milliardenverluste, Marcel Ospel Verwaltungsratspräsident, is still the second - best - paid on board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis and the collapse of the state had to be rescued.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation, six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe they Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole country was shocked - because she has said, as dramatic for a small country, if it is so large banks.
After all, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the performance of the Switzerland (see chart).
“ Once again, we could not save the UBS, ” says Bankenforscher auditions.
In the first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, surrendered the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared that it was prepared to make the data high - net - worth clients, perhaps with the help of the bank had evaded taxes.
Moreover, they pay a 780 - million - dollar as repayment of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag.
So that the well - known UBS more or less open to tax evasion.
At the same time it lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the swiss banking secrecy is not the same thing.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident.
And the exodus of Kundengeldern.
The bank within a few months of their credibility in two key portfolios lost: in the investment banking and wealth management in the speculation errors made by the aid to tax evasion.
And just when it was a little calmer, just when you thought, here 's UBS will get it back, there is this unfortunate traders - history: an individual traders gambling found themselves 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something was wrong.
And it appears to be: with the risk management, the investment banking business it operates are obviously still not.
“ With the case of Adoboli, we find that the risk controls too little has changed, ” says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University of Zurich.
The Finanzvorstand a major german bank is sure: “ the problem of UBS is that it will contain not under control. ”
It was just the idea of caution, with the swiss bankers for a long time was launched, guardian of the major assets of the world: not too much risks, for security for money - went beyond the Alpenrepublik times the world would collapse.
The coffers of the swiss banks were a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and especially noble Sprüngli for chocolate.
The UBS 's headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the sterling swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.
The situation is standard practice.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße by the Central Station from directly to the Zürichsee leads by the covered summits of the swiss mountains frames.
The buildings here are magnificent, the Ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers as Tiffany 's will be here as the swiss Traditionsgeschäften Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the swiss banks, the National Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear.
The Empfangssaal the UBS enters one by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are thick marmorverkleidet, empty chair, in addition to the bank - logo is a great sign for the “ safe ”.
The UBS know what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the swiss bank have both swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point out - or betrayed, as the head of a small swiss private bank.
His name, he preferred not to read in the press, after all, like all swiss bankers, even with the two big business.
The UBS has become far too big, it will, especially in the investment banking business, which is also the Anglo - saxons have spread.
The Swiss have there is nothing more to say.
“ And if you are, they have a long time ago the habits of the Anglo - saxons. ”
Indeed, it was the Anglo - Saxon investment banking, the UBS changed its high profits and induced then the debacle: no european financial institution in the sub - prime jungle so much lost money as the swiss banking.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster.
“ On that Wednesday decided the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bail - out in the history of their nation, ” writes the author Lucas Hässig in his book “ the UBS - crunch. ”
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians to the bankruptcy of the large bank to save.
How could this happen?
When you talk with swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three swiss banks to a huge corporation.
There was a bank that has been in the merger was too large for the small country of Switzerland and continue to grow.
It helped that the two different precursor, the banks UBS supplemented: a rich, but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalised.
Suddenly, the investment banker internationalised favourable to a great deal of money, with a huge wheel.
Two names are with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Konzernchef of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“ I always thought that Wuffli Ospel and were a Traumteam, ” says Hans Bankenforscher auditions.
“ Wuffli, the Hochintellektuelle, the modest, and a great deal of models and statistics, and understands the Bauchmensch Ospel, from the top of the Banklehre heraufgearbeitet. ”
But Ospel has finally Wuffli leave.
And Wuffli was probably at the end of a fatal error: “ he thought his models are the reality, ” says auditions.
“ This is a tragic case. ”
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: an excess came before the fall.
Staff of the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders - meetings, on which Konzernchef Wuffli again and again on the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone.
The american bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the “ League Tables ” rankings that the success of the banks that time documented.
Then, after UBS wanted to the top.
Some of the steps were her deals.
In the Devisengeschäft and in the trading in shares, she played with top.
The consultant, were called, but a weakness: in international Zinsgeschäft, in the “ Bankersprache fixed income ”, there is a huge gap on the biggest banks.
The UBS have gaps in american Hypothekenprodukten.
To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that they almost the existence of cost.
Hungry for growth, both invested by the Bank itself, as well as a before her established hedge funds in american subprime assets.
It has become a huge machine, the securities on american packaged mortgage lending and passing - but also risks even maintained.
Also, as other banks for a long time out.
“ Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market in flames, the UBS bought there, ” says Bankenexperte auditions.
The euphoria, so deep the case.
A manager after the others had to go, the attempts to clean up are more difficult than had been thought.
Item in the UBS, for this and to date have been shaky.
Who now leads the large bank, has an almost impossible job.
It needs a strategy for a bank to find all the obvious abhandengekommen business models.
Bankenforscher auditions has already an idea: put an end to the focus on investment banking, asset management, return to the swiss roots.
Quite so far to the bank while do not (yet).
But to shrink the investment banking firm, it is already clear.
On Thursday, will the new Bankchef Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.
The 51 - year - old italian - swiss was really a temporary solution designed, as the Bank is surprising of predecessor Grübel.
Now he has pushed through: he is the business of the UBS, shared the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to the levels in the mid - 1990s.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
And they want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
Publicly he says so far, only that he and his wife once a home in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent Krähen broad in cities from
In many places, Saatkrähen as “ Problemvögel ”: but in the cities, the highly intelligent animals no longer drive, say experts.
The one they may be, the other, they want to get rid of very quickly: Krähen belong to the erased from for centuries, but in many local authorities are more frequent Anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a remedy for the “ Problemvögel ” has so far not in sight.
Saatkrähen are from the cities not to get out more, experts said the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen Leer.
There we consulted experts from the entire Bundesgebiet on possible ways out.
If you are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists have led the problems in towns and cities to the exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen back: the Chemieeinsatz in agriculture destroying increasingly the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing building and the cases of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds.
Krähen are under nature conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren there is, among other things, in the westphalian Soest in the north - west, among other things, and Jever Diepholz Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to mass killing of Krähen in the district for Negativ - headlines.
Critics had the trapping the animals in Vogelfallen and Erschlagen with clubs as particularly brutal.
“ The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, nothing, ” the town and Landschaftsplaner Werner Klöver from Leer said.
Nests with water wegspritzen or trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the emperor from an expert on Manfred Lahr in Baden - Württemberg.
“ The animals from soft, large colonies split on and is spread to other areas. ”
Vergrämung is just as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
“ We have to live with them, we will get them away. ”
Without the surrounding area will solve the problem in the cities not resolve, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from the sensitive Wohnbereichen and misleading them in other places again.
“ Instead of chain saws Infotafeln ” campaigning against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals: “ in the face of a Pickel, we can finally best self - confident. ”
Jürgens had in Schleswig - Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen - Lehrpfad co - founded, in the notices about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen information.
The project will now have already adopted by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens think: “ there is a lot of communication, which have a lot to say. ”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen use not only tool to in a biscuit, but, as their tools even itself.
Animal behaviorists Cambridge University tested recently four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds learned quickly that it with stones, a structure to overthrow, in order to a Mottenlarve.
Without a lot of training they realized single - mindedness, the size and shape of a stone must have the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the smart Krähen then kniffligeres a problem to solve.
In a vertical cylinders, the researchers set up a small buckets with a Mottenlarve placement.
With the Schnabel, the birds do not achieve their prey.
However, the researchers Drahtstücke them off.
It was formed between all four animals a catch to help them the buckets on grip from the bag angelten.
Three of the four Saatkrähen manage even right away.

Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book “ beauty and a history of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies ” with a long list of main people who contribute to a to heart.
Here, a piece of advice about how we could: you are raising this side of caution and you make it to your Lesezeichen.
You will see these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well to get to know each other, and these protagonists than your GPS function, as the beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and lost your illusions are deprived of.
Peter Englund is a swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has an unusual book written, which he did not incorrect as “ a work of the anti - history ”.
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather “ a book about how it was. ” it is about “ emotions, impressions, experience and moods. ”
“ Beauty and the experience of war of terror ” almost 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, Krankenwagenfahrer and clerks.
Some of these people to be heroes.
Some are prisoners of war, to lose Gliedmaße, be crazy or die.
Each of these lives truce as Votivkerzen in a church that some will add, while others fade away.
Englunds book is different from the usual history books.
It also revised the idea, the First World War was just the devastating entrenched position in the Westfront.
“ Beauty and horror ” moves with Expertenblick on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, of East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, a fall Bienenkörbe celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.
This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book.
The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina, the following Kordit smell.
Imagine you are a woman who at home with their children, and the cannon 's fire in the distance, you hear or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war in the first place.
“ A lack of facts, ” Englund said that “ were on assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, hare - brained ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares, rumours treaty. ”
“ Beauty and horror ” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard root, a young german Schiffsmatrosen.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already published material removed.
Your Lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple, but they are very alive in Englunds the details in that collection of small moments.
Many of them act of shortage and Behelfen.
In the history of a german Schulmädchens tells it: “ a substitute, replacing everywhere. ”
“ Ersatzkaffee aluminium, wrong, wrong, eraser Papierverbände, Holzknöpfe. ”
He told more of the Ersatzessen in Germany.
He describes “ the meat from large compressed and rice cooked in Hammelfett (and least with a false bones from wood served), tobacco, from dried agricultural roots and dried Kartoffelschalen, shoes, with wood besohlt. ”
There was, as he noted, “ 837 Nahrungsersatzmittel registered in the manufacture of hot dogs were allowed, 510 - registered Kaffeeersatzmittel. ”
Some stories act of honour and bravery.
An American acknowledges its own rush towards the ferocity and says of the war: “ one feels that in spite of everything that is, more for men than in Lehnstuhl to sit with the Abendblatt or the best - seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and to do so, as such a façade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind the own strengthened and beschlagenen Hemdbrust. ”
Conversely, a british soldier recognises that it is likely to die, and no one notice or would be done.
“ If you by the idea of self - sacrifice, is backing away, you would think that this is happening in front of an audience, ” he writes.
Instead it is so terrible as “ a convicted man who was hanged in secret. ”
Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror.
“ The conflict has been a growing economic competition, ” writes Englund, “ a war between the factories. ”
He catches the arrival of a what he “ a new species in the Bestiarium the young century ”: “ the word - looking and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick, the slaughter, while he is sitting behind a desk. ”
People behave to unforeseen way and there is also frivoles behaviour such as heroic acts.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively trying to a prostitute with a Geschlechtskrankheit contagion to the Frontdienst to escape.
“ The bizarre expression can trade with Gonokokken - Eiter discovered, as soldiers and bought their genitals grease, in the hope that the way to enter the hospital to come ”, he writes.
“ Those who really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which led to them the rest of their lives were blind. ”
In this translation from a Peter Graves will Englunds poetry and elastic but intrusiveness and fit perfectly in his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, as the war “ in unprecedented fashion uncontrollable forces unleashed: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred. ”
The people are starting to ask why their leaders for fighting.
The best books about the First World War were mainly a distorted as Paul Fussells “ Great was and Modern memory ” or novels as Erich Maria Remarques “ nothing new ” in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds bond is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle.
His book, the most devastating, at the end of which I ever in a Sachbuch read.
I am no longer.
But it is, as he would have us with his book with this side of the protagonists in the nose and snapped with a match on fire.
After an early trip a meticulously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers have been involved in, some of them wore Einsatzhelme.
We have for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at the time people in Zucotti Park.
The operation has been kept secret and only a few high - level officials were informed. all other thought at the beginning, in an exercise.
Chief Constable Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of his presence among them and underlined the fact that the operation is full of challenges.
The events of the past few weeks as the onset of has against protesters, which is against the rules of the Dezernats and the Hausbesetzern a huge increase in public sympathy, could not be repeated.
And so was the police operation to the removal of the protesters from the 's Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials have had this prepared by saw occupations in other cities have been implemented.
A Katastrophenübung had with a look at 's Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials from the so - called chaos - training - counter - terrorism measures, including the rapid displacing a large number of police officers are on a lower Manhattan.
The last Schulungseinheit Montagnacht found on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order, in the park, was “ at the last minute, ” said someone who is familiar with the order, which for a description as “ exercise ”.
“ The few police officers who have been involved, as far as I know, did not know that it is just about the 's Zuccotti Park was, ” said someone who wants to remain anonymous.
“ The only ones who knew that the 's Zuccotti Park, are the high - ranking officials of the portfolio. ”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, officials wanted to the park, but were then, when hundreds of Protestlern came together after these plans had received.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including force from around the city, hundreds of mobile officials, which normally in high - crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the park and out of, almost like commuters, 1 p. m. in the night is a good time to go.
“ It was appropriate to do that, if the smallest number of people living in the park, ” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiterlampen and loudspeakers were faced with the departure of the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre - recorded news from the loudspeakers dröhnten, many seemed to intimidate protesters.
As the public officials in their hellblauen Windjacken in the park broke rafften many protesters simply your things together and walked out of the place.
The police said that until 1: 45 p. m., no tents would be touched the Protestlern time to their homes and possessions together.
Other teams of officials have been seen in the area around collected to intervene, should arrests in the park.
Reporters have been forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this is to their own security.
But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent the police actions in the park to see, and they said that the way in which the officials, is too harsh.
Mr Browne said that Fernsehwagen in the Church Street in the Westseite photographs of the park have been able to.
When the police in west through the mess in personal terms of the protesters, including suitcase, and Kunstrasen Tüten with clothes, turbulent, followed by its employees, the cleaning the city removed what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go to the outside world were towed. images that appeared to have a short time later on the Internet.
A Hauptkern of Protestlern referred to in the vicinity of the Küchenbereichs of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police dismissed their methodological arrests continue.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tie in her arms.
And two people would chain itself to trees, said Mr Kelly.
The civil protection officials were to them loszuschneiden.
As Mr Kelly said, by about 3: 30 p. m., no arrests in the park.
The evacuation was according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people in the park have been arrested.
Most of the arrests was, as he said, due to “ disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. ”
The most prominent officials on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officers of the department.
Phil Pulaski, the T. Abteilungschef Kriminalbeamten, was also there.
Despite his presence “ ran ” Mr Kelly “ operation ”, as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should have access, was waiting for a second group of officials on the eastern side of the Broadway and Liberty Street, between Cedar.
In the Cortlandt Street, a Straßenblock north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.
It could be watched, as these sites from the vicinity of the police to the 's Zuccotti park stretch.
In one place, was seen as a number of civil servants, many of them with Schutzschildern, people drove to the outside world.
Around 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night, in the south of the park.
5 p. m. against jumped south of the Pine Street a protesters on the roof of a Polizeifahrzeugs and other demonstrators, the air in the tyre a Polizeibusses.
In one place raised the amount of a piece of Sperrholz.

Union organizers will result of redundancies lawsuit against the city of table
The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern, the last month have lost their jobs, representing the city on Wednesday, is planning to sue, because the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence in schools, the poor students, not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance, the local council in the trade union, 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, still is open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer Betreuungskoordinatoren, and other staff members, who are the worst paid employees of the city and were on October 7, in a move that had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for that last year the city 's access to a Gesundheitsfond, the working groups, had denied the Haushaltslücke should be closed.
The allegations were made by the authorities rejected outright.
At a hearing of the council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, the redundancies are part of the budget that passed in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that staff Schulhilfe will be made redundant.
Officials of the council 37 said that they had, and warned the Education Ministry in a complaint. on Wednesday it will give a press conference, at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan, formally announced.
The application will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of the city as a defendant, eight laid - off workers as the plaintiff, all of which are non - white or latin american women, as most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of the city, said that the city was not the case and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a Klageentwurfs, of the New York Times, the trade union has on the number of job losses at schools in the slums of the city, a legal case for discrimination to support claims that poor schools more workers would have lost, as they are chronically underfunded.
It points out that, while there is no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools' s Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 Schulhelfer in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost 46 and aid workers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the observation by the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern, 36 in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, “ this is not a neighborhood - wealthy parents who can organise donations to budget cuts. ”
P. S.: the budget of the 36th district, this year has been to 3,26 per cent cut. addition, lost money, the city of their method of calculating the Extrafinanzierung for each Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.
The union also complained that the head of the High - all with the language in a memo in the bottle, which led to the dismissal of the Betreuungskoordinatoren approved.
The memo used the word “ excess ”, to describe the act, even if “ excess ” (german): send in the United States usually the change of practitioners of the payroll a school in a pool of available workers to describe the central office will be paid for.
“ Sechsundsechzig Betreuungskoordinatoren have been laid off, not to, ” says the Klageentwurf.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
At the end of the day, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington, already on the uprisings in Libya to communicate.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long - time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the american interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution, which the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), and Libya is for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their “ courage ” praises.
“ This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya, with the reconstruction of the country have begun, ” said Kerry.
“ This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties. ”
The language may sound was innocent, but so far nothing easy in the Libya debate.
This summer arguing legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya - the NATO mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution, which the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya approved.
The law has been in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties rejected and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law in the Senate and the House by overruling a decision to cut money for american operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission in a kind of purgatory legislative - with a Congress that found enough, Obama 's approach in the context of the mission to criticize, but not angry enough to him once the rug from under their feet.
Then the indecision of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August, among the libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be willing to take action.
The resolution of the Committee for international relations “ congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and perseverance of the extraordinary in its self - liberation ” and “ commends the men and women of the US military and its coalition partner, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism. ”
The resolution also “ reaffirmed the national interests of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy. ”
Will the new measures the full support of the board to foreign relations received or are they the legislators divide the law in June, has done?
The latest version to the opposing the Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the leaders of the Republican Committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that it has the final version of the new law have not seen.
According to Capitol Hill, the onus is on the Senate, this week on a constitutional change that a balanced budget that calls for a top priority in almost every Kongresslegislaturperiode of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be time to vote in the Senate or the Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to do so, the changes are being put to the vote, even though they are often enough tried.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented this Congress and a whole range of subjects.
Some are twice - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate before other soft only slightly.
There are alone in the Senate at least 15 versions of the Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen, the “ federal control ”.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their customers, especially rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast about that any such action “ written ”.
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which in August was adopted, that requires both Senate and Congress on a revision of the Haushaltsausgleichs vote.
In March, 58 senators for a non - binding resolution that favour the idea of such a change.
On the budget, to some members of the number of the rules, the members of Congress can come up with that limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) the limit of two terms in office, the president wants to tear up.
The Republicans Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes, including the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment, a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen bans, as well as an alteration to the burning of flags from a recurring presentation.
Some legislators also want the removal of federal laws when two thirds of the states vote against it.
So keen, as the members suggest changes, so poorly they move more quickly, as in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators 77 such changes in 110. Congress 66.
The pace of pales in comparison with that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 proposed changes every two years, so the figures that the Senatsbibliothek available.
But they were also not much more successful than today 's.
The last change that needs to be added to the 27 -, was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already in 1789, the Congress proposed.
“ Getroffen, but not defeated, ” Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man from close distance while canvassing in Tucson shoot at them, the Republikanerin Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday night on national tv and sang the only Broadway - piece of “ the Sun wants to come out tomorrow ” and said that the desire to recover, is greater than the in the Congress to return.
Alongside Diane Sawyer of ABC News “ 20 / 20 ”, after fighting words and needed assistance walking.
The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet, the shared her skull, the left - hand side of your brain durchbohrt and its head, from start to finish, crosses, has caused.
Three months ago, she returned surprising in the Congress to triumphantly their voice in debt.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 were wounded, smiling, Gifford laughed and sang and described her recovery as “ difficult ”.
When Sawyer asked her how they feel, said Gifford (41): “ quite well. ”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one - hour “ 20 / 20 ” - Specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: “ Gabby: a story of courage and hope. ”
The Special followed Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January.
In the videos, Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in his hospital bed, with kahl rasiertem head and a long scarf on the forehead.
You can only one or two finger, if her husband encouraged.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while their therapists, showing them how simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A Zucken with the lips.
And then, their first words: “ what. ”
After a few days of whispering Giffords another word: “ toast ” and you would like to see their breakfast is changed.
In the video, the NBC show took place, show that music has an important role in Giffords' recovery played: you see, such as the members of Congress, along with the therapist to Cyndi Laupers “ Girls Just Wanna have fun, ” and Tom Pettys “ Free Fallin ” sings. ”
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, the two hours every day with therapy needs to go to the day of the attack cannot remember.
Her husband said that it was Giffords on March 12, a daily newspaper in an article on the attack had read it off, and for the first time after the six people asked during the attack had been killed.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and will forcibly treated while he was on trial is waiting.
“ Many people are dead, ” Giffords told Sawyer.
“ Tough, tough, tough. ”
In the course of his wife, Kelly told Sawyer, she said: “ I have been taken. ”
“ So, I would say, “ Gabby, you cannot be defeated ”?, ” said Kelly.
You will only be taken.
And you will get through this and you will you recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel sympathy rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street - Gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, collected a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
“ The servicemen and women have been seen as a hero, ” said David Saltzman, the Spendenaktion organised in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, on the Stabchef and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“ They were introduced as orphans, ” the officer wrote in an e - mail.
I am sure that the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, not really, it was sympathy for them.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring american public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige.
The public is acting increasingly, as do the people in uniform of suffering.
“ We were not sacrifice, ” said Brigade General B. Sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan soon after.
“ But it seems that the only way the support of one of us in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate. ”
The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders, not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, seem to want.
They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War clothed, much worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion on the quiet and private between war veterans.
After his two sons from fighting with the marines have returned, warned the Colonel (a. D. Mark Cancian them from that people outside the world of their military service from two different perspectives could see.
Some of them with a sense of awe, since they rebels defeated and to exotic places have visited.
Others wonder whether a “ angry, violent veteran under the surface, ” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return, a senior Staatsposten in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly erfragten, whether he was unable to immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
“ If you talk about your service, they must be the negative impressions argue, ” declared Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in a lack of interest on the part of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield, a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely as praise singled out.
“ We as a nation estimate military heroism is not more so, as it has been in the Second World War was normal practice, ” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the focus of the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, they are suffering, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is the increasing pressure to crack down on rape
This week to decide an important hearing about whether 28 men and women because of non - intervention in a rape before the military court to be charged.
It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Obergefreite Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped at night by a Soldatenkollegen.
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego, the dinner with a friend, as a male colleagues, who was the one 12er Pack beer in itself.
He asked her whether to accompany a drink in their rooms.
“ My alarm bells to, ” said Lyman.
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns.
I thought: “ no, no, he is 19.
He is from Texas, ” she said.
“ I wish I had on my gut instincts. ”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and they were raped, it claims.
This week, on 18 November, wait Lyman and 27 other current and former Militärangestellte anxious to a trial with an historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a charge against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have to be in court are allowed.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not widespread rape in the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D. C., comprised of the lawsuit initially 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of which claim that they are of Soldatenkollegen raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or a reasonable case law after the alleged attacks to provide.
Burke says it is monitoring the supreme military command, because the problem there will begin.
“ The military is hierarchical ”, she says.
“ But who are the individuals in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the lead. ”
Burke also says that since February, it has been in contact with almost 400 more survivors, many of them may be part of future claims.
Your strategy: instead of claimants, so to speak, for all their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints to submit to keep up the pressure.
The team of defence for the Department of Defense, led by Bundesstaatsanwalt Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action.
The files of the court, the Newsweek, lead, in detail, the defense to, first of all, that the military does not of current or former soldiers for injuries can be tried in the armed forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court in the 1950s, the so - called “ Feres Doctrine, there is the government not for injury, which is in active service, the soldiers to be added.
“ The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs, ” says the document.
The Department of Defense refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not to the service in the fight are permitted, it is only on behalf of the distinction: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams play by female soldiers increasingly important roles, especially in the contact links with local women in the war zones.
The result: between the two wars died 150 soldiers, two - thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time for the military modernisation, says Burke.
And it is in their fight not alone: three further apart from their complaints are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran ” Legal Services Clinic lawsuit against the four main military academies, because of alleged promoting a hostile atmosphere.
This independent collects the not - for - profit Vietnam veteran of America a legal case against the military government, to be the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, the rape victims received it from the service to a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati, the Service Women 's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group, in December, a complaint against the veteran Administration (, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for people accusing felt, in the service of sexually abused.
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse), Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses.
But the majority of abuses are not registered at all and the estimate of the Pentagon 's own account of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, on the face of it a year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the Strafverfolgungsraten: 2010 came 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military in a court of law, only half as many as in the civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In case they Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was 11 times, asked the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and military commanders to tell.
You had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was by a judge heard. during this hearing, it was after the sex asked before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said as Charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of will, in the end, was acquitted.
“ I remember the day when the verdict was read out, ” Lyman says.
“ I thought that would go into labor. I ran screaming from the courtroom. ”
“ They brought me to the psychiatric unit and I remember that I, when I came out again, to my commander said that was not his trial. that was my procedure. ”
Lyman has been asked to visit Militärpsychiater will, in the end, a personality disorder diagnosed and for dienstunfähig said.
In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so that they do not support.
Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
However, it says: “ I believe they are making progress. ”
What between them and a verdict is, is this doctrine, criticised the will, for the first time, was called into question.
I am a critic throughout their life the Feres Doctrine.
The military is still lagging behind a decade later, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability.
He adds: “ the odds are against them … but it is important for them to try. ”
These things will only change, if good people are ready to fight.
If the item is not hearing their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
“ We are going to the military, in this regard, continue to fight until reforms ”, she says.
Or until we die, whatever the first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers see you on Facebook
Before the new face of the right - wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, just one of many boys who their anti - Einwanderungsmeinung online broadcast.
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has a great deal of time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the extreme right - wing groups on the part of social support networks.
After the tragedy of this past summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy, you only have to connect on Facebook.
“ We have found that it was not difficult, to go to them, ” says Jamie Bartlett, the Hauptautor a recent report of the british Ideenfabrik DEMOS, on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide - and - seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch Bartlett, says that the researchers simply Werbetool the side have to use their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy decide exactly - as retailers have done for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far - right groups throughout Europe and visierte it with Adds, but rather than with a new band or a new Diätprodukt to effect, invited the Adds users to a survey in which after their level of education, their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation, more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right - wing parties in 11 european countries to question - without even to her office would have to leave.
“ It is a fairly new research method, ” says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as a surprise hardly. online promoter of far - right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, “ those who make their online activism with an off - line activism combine sensible, democratic and less violent than those who are behind their computer screens to sit still. ”
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientists use the hand, study it all, of health issues to Gesellschaftstrends as in “ Likes ”, text messages and Statusaktualisierungen.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day add, generated Facebooks “ Datensupernova ” a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side of the title in the last five years, almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that this side of people studying, usually with his Clipboard on the road is not achieved.
“ If he had previously tried to people of the British National Party to ask, it was very difficult to identify them. ”
“ You had to inform the first of the party and they never would have access to, ” says Bartlett.
“ Facebook is everything away, you will go directly to them. ”
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to social health problems to identify and resolve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who their Vollrausch on Facebook, significantly more than the Problemtrinken tend to students who remained silent on the issue.
Moreno is proposing that equal students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they make many Statusaktualisierungen postet.
“ You can 't solve a problem if you have not heard of, ” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co - author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development on Children' s Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
“ We have found an opportunity to vulnerable children to identify the, not been found. ”
Facebook zapft also constantly the data of its own people.
The Datenteam the side has statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentine 's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid - term elections, and a National Glücksindex produced (and the first data have been used on the all - access Facebook has perfected the digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great Datenfundgrube for other for research purposes, to make.)
But the users of Facebook, know that the side observed them, whether they want it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allowed one of the side 's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey, from which they do not even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down as to how they collect data offline to online is allowed to do anything.
“ I do not believe that many users at all reflecting on the fact that researchers could study their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he public sides of students on Facebook investigated.
“ What it is, it was only for them and their friends. ”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a Forschungsteilnehmer absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a Nutzerprofil and in speeches are true.
“ What you on Facebook says and what is outside of Facebook, are two different things, ” says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as Technologieforscher that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best Forschungswerkzeuge is that everyone can use.
“ There is no substitute for the real world and with real people to talk to, ” he says.
“ Social research to turn to the social care and a lot of social life is still offline. ”
“ Cold and inhumane ”: in other Behring Breivik appears to be the first time a public court
In other Behring Breivik, the man, the two Amokläufe, in which this summer in Norway 77 people have been killed, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a “ resistance fighters described. ”
“ I am a Militärkommandeur in the norwegian resistance movement and a Tempelritter Norway, ” he said before a court with more than 500 people.
“ I object to the court, because your mandate of organizations have received the Hassideologien support and because it has the support of multiculturalism. ”
“ I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty. ”
Judges Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he “ Breivik, not the possibility of wanted to give this hearing as a platform to use on his views. ”
For the same reason, he refused to Breivik wrote in advance of a speech mitbrachte, permits to at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 weeks in custody, he retains four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some arrived in the hope that Breivik in the eye can see, some wanted to the confirmation that he was behind bars.
All took part, with the aim of everything on a Wegschließen.
“ I thought he looks cold and inhumane ”, told a survivor of Utoya the norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“ It was uncomfortable, but for me, it is a bit, when I saw and heard the suspect. ”
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted throughout the hearing, he looked calm and professional journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
In spite of Breiviks bizarrem saying that he would be part of a larger “ resistance ” movement, the judges came to the conclusion that he is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may be for some that the attacks on 22 July what appears to be the work of an individual was not the extremists and a group of radical.
But making it easier to automatically the sadness and the confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“ I wish that he sees as a monster, but it does not, ” said the members of a victim.
“ It would be so much easier if he did. ”
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, this week in a theatre was shown
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some of it with Henry Ford and raised the Technikgenie as a large, modern inventors.
What Apple 's fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs - interview, which this week in particular Filmvorführungen on the major markets dusted off, is how much the creative head networking and routines understood.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self - appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who thought that many managers in “ a disease of thought ”, “ a really great idea 90 per cent of the total work … [but] there is a huge amount of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. ”
Bob Cringely 1995 developed the tv series “ triumph of Fachidioten ” as a result of the personal computer, and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs, in one of the rare, detailed talks led.
At that time, and 10 years since jobs from Apple. and he has already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview in Fachidioten has been used, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview in the supply were missing.
Jobs death only after it was also found that a full copy of VHS - in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film footage that forms the basis for the 68minütigen film “ Steve Jobs: the Lost, ” the interview this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark - theatre.
For someone who is well - known for detailed interviews detests seems surprisingly busy jobs here in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly interesting.
In the course of the interview, it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly weighed up his ideas and accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs, ” perfect to days when he apparently impatient Cringelys responded to questions and anschubst more quickly with issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included seems the lost interview somehow incredibly far - sighted, if jobs assessed what other companies believes is right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to posthumous awards the career jobs ” to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Just after he has said all had, and he made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews:
As he learned to do business:
“ Throughout the years in the business, I always ask: “ why are you doing things? ” and the answer that you always have, is: “ oh, so it will be easy. ”
No one knows why he is doing what he is doing, no one in the business think very carefully about things.
I have found.
Jobs his efforts on the accounting for Apple to streamline.
Perplexed, such as cost record - usually began with “ Standardkosten ” at the mere suggestion put out, and then with the “ anomaly ” - it developed the automated factory, who ensured that the Geschäftskosten to micromanage being identified.
As the Pope veralbert:
Jobs told of the “ blue boxes ” that he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device which we have been in the telephone company slip and long - distance calls for nothing.
On the device much has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, the blue as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, making it a gebührenpflichtiges phone use, and then make a phone call from an AT &amp;amp; T network to another, while so many satellites as possible durchschleifen.
“ We sent about a half - dozen times around the globe and if we telephone grölte, there was a minute later in the telephone next door out ”, tells kichernd jobs.
“ We were young and we learned that we ourselves can make something that billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world can control. ”
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing, which is a huge thing can control, that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them, Apple would be.
Jobs told further away from a glorious gimmick, the Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican phoning and with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could, Henry Kissinger nachmachten.
As several members of the catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night, have been called in to deal with the american diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself up the phone.
As he has been in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a Frequenzzähler, seeking to Bill Hewlett in telephone directory and called on it to.
Shortly after her 20 - minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part - time at Hewlett - Packard.
“ This has had a remarkable influence on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated. ”
Later, Jobs one of the HP - the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto, where he visited “ the first 's desktop computers, ever made ”.
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre and I verliebte me in it.
I would, if HP as a teenager and climb to the top of this machine, and programmes, they write.
How innovation improved:
Several times in the interview talking about jobs and about how to spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career, when he some einbaute situation, he was asked by a customer, the whole computers assemble them.
He was working with a payment of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the ready - made equipment drawing board.
Later on, Apple he will recall the problems in the development of a Computermaus:
“ I remember very strong arguments … they screamed at me, that it would take five years to a mouse to build the $300 would cost] and I went out and found a manufacturer. ”
90 days later we had a mouse, for $15 to construct. that was amazing credible.
On large companies that continue:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in stumbling and control over their shares lost.
“ We say, you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printers, so what? ”
You have the Aktienmonopol, so is the company was more successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so there are such people [are] at the end of the day, the companies and the product, with which the people from the decision - making process.
The Produktgenie, which led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, wiped out - Handwerkskunst necessary.
That happened in Xerox …
Xerox had all the computer industry.
We have ten times more can be, the Microsoft of the 1990 's can be …
You have the defeat by the victory.
About innovation as an art form.
“ It 's a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product … if this great idea, they are changing and growing. ”
We are learning a lot about its nuances.
It must be votes, certain things that you can 't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5,000 terms, these concepts, and all of them together …
In the end, it amounts to the taste, what it comes down to is that we try to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these matters to the together, what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly steal in the grand ideas.
Part of what makes Macintosh great was made, that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not be in the computer business, they would have been in other areas of fantastic things.
Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the Gesundheitsgesetze, as a court case takes
On the same day that the Supreme Court behind closed doors to the politically teilende question about whether it is a challenge to the Gesundheitsgesetze by President Obama will hear, made two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and finally there is Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Chancellery gesponsort, that was the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges are meeting to discuss met on the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases handled an appeal by the 26 states against the far - reaching reform of the healthcare system, the last year by Congress approved a law in the conservative activists across the United States on the slogan.
The judge agreed with the hearing on; indeed, in March, a 5 1 / 2 - hour Grundlagendiskussion expected, probably the result will probably boost the Präsidentschaftskampf 2012, at the time, in which the court 's decision is made public, will be in full swing.
The lawyer, the courts, and will maintain that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, Attorney General once under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements' s cabinet, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies, the annual dinner of the federalist society, a veteran group, which the defence of conservative principles.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another was the sponsor Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the enormous process is involved.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court on the debate, in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, America 's the Fraktionschef of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health - care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years events the federalist society.
And it is not against moral rules.
In fact, the judges by the code of conduct, free of the actions of the lower Bundesrichter.
They were there, they might well under the principle 4c Code, which states: “ a judge can get near law and other organisations to take part, and the judge, according to a spokesman for guest or programme does not a guest, such events. ”
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the with the case of related practices, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality - and - Regierungsaktivisten alert.
“ The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code gives the complaints by some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules for all other Bundesrichter apply, ” said Bob Edgar, President of the common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
“ The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trials at the court. ”
Your attitude and their support for this event a Spendenaktion undermine any right to impartial and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics, who say they are Gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups that are off the agenda, such as the federalist society, mix.
And the wife, Ginni Thomas ” is a well - known conservative activist.
However, the Conservatives that Judge Elena Kagan was a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration, when the first Gesetzesanfechtungen in the first instance in court.
Your critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias to withdraw because they are too much in defending the law committed to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do that.
Boeing is Rekordauftrag of 18 trillion dollars in country
Airline Emirates ordered two - track 50 Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for a further 20 aircraft.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is a rare news that a company a contract 50 on some of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the Listenpreis for these 50 aircraft overall in a Rekordsumme of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the parent of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future Flugzeugbestellungen.
In a prediction that was published on Monday, the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2.520 aircraft in the value of 450 trillion dollar needs.
Boeing announced at the weekend, his biggest task of all time for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: two - track 50 Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammerauftrag came from the airline Emirates Dubai.
The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 on the Dubai Luftfahrtschau, an option for the purchase of 20 other aircraft, the whole Listenpreis to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday appointed according to Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8, the so - called the Dreamliner, the fuel efficiency and passenger comfort vastly improved.
The Listenpreis for six of these aircraft is running at more than $1 trillion.
“ This is absolutely positive for Boeing, ” said seeking Dihora, Börsenfachmann of Morningstar.
“ The quality of this particular customers is very high. ”
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil - producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft, but a rise in oil prices, which normally airlines damages, as this is one of their biggest cost items, is not harmful, because the country is on a higher oil price.
This is important, because it will be less than other airlines tend to Flugzeugbestellungen to cancel or postpone, when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
“ You have a natural hedge ”, he said.
The order from Emirates confirmed Boeing 's leading position in the market for large and helps the Airbus SAS competitors at bay, the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing 's victory on the Luftfahrtschau comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777 - 300er.
It postponed the introduction of more confidence after the customers and reach a higher Nutzlast had asked for.
The Boeing - shares rose 1.5% to $67,94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims the drug traffickers Fausto Vallejo opponents of the PRI, in the race for 's governorships will have supported.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have their application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent Staatswahlen lost. she claimed on Monday, drug traffickers have the race in favor of their opponents.
After the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of Institutional Party of the revolution, the PRI, the race for the state 's governorships will in the western won.
“ The intervention of the organised crime throughout the election processes and particularly on yesterday 's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country, ” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a Radiointerview one day after the elections on Sunday.
“ They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls … they have occupied polling booths, roadblocks set up … and people charged, [for] the PRI to vote. ”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are trying to have a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI looks forward to a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon seems barely to have beaten in opinion polls ahead of the election day yet.
Calderon, a conservative candidate of the people 's Nacional PAN trailing her brother, refused to Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left - wing Democratic Revolutionspartei PRD, which is currently acting governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left - wing 's leaders for the 2012 presidential election.
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and pushing the other candidates, to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels to marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen, Michoacan in December 2006, a military - led offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor, a week before the election while canvassing for Luisa Maria Calderon killed and many candidates are from anxiety in the local elections dropped out.
A victory for the PRI strengthens the party, no matter how vicious the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man, the PRI in the presidential race probably will be represented, is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, congratulated and said: “ I think that it is a victory that courageously to next year can look forward to. ”
ADB urges Asia to help to save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Development Bank, India and China to the rescue of the eurozone in its debt crisis to support a long - term downward trend to prevent the growth of Asia 's economy will slow down.
Rajat Nag, executive director of the ADB 's, which is based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world “ everything in your power ” need to do to the recovery of the Währungsblocks either by the International Monetary Fund or through direct reciprocal agreements to speed up.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the “ a ” to the problems in Europe, and said that the financial support of the european leadership and european resources by Asia a long - term collapse of the global economy to prevent helps.
“ We are all in the same boat. ”
“ So everyone is helpful, which can help Europe out of this crisis, ” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“ Asia may to some extent be protected, but it is not immune. ”
“ If China and India is able to help, then by all means possible. ”
Europe 's monetary union, in the past few months, in a serious debt crisis.
In the last few days, Italy 's borrowing costs to dangerous and the Prime Minister of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The arrival of serious debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging economies need to join the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support of Asia by the IMF, but said that reciprocal agreements, such as the purchase of bonds of the EU 's bail - out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the european partners in Asia offer greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, India 's trade minister, said that “ India is going to do everything in its power ” to the euro zone to help, because your economy is now under the fall in exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
“ No one wants to do that the euro zone is still fragile and turbulent remains, ” he said.
“ We are facing big challenges and we need to have a high Wachstumsebene. ”
“ It is not an option, it is a task, because where we find work for our millions of young men and women. ”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India have no reason the rich Europeans to help, if they even before major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult, the 1.2 billion people in India assistance to Europe to sell, of which more than 800 million from $2 or less a day on live.
“ Eventually, they will find that the greeks with 50 to retire and holidays on the beach, then you have a problem, ” he said.
Lee Howell, executive director of the similar Weltwirtschaftforums, asked why India 's reserves should be used in Greece the numerous and well - paid employees in the public sector, with jobs in low geleitetet losses einbringenden institutions such as the train.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone “ significant knock - on effects ” on all of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB 's with a growth rate of about 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011 / is now threatening the risk of “ the graduate ” because of the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets should “ contingency plans ” to prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant Kapitalabwanderung their Wortschaften to protect.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he is warned that automatic budget cuts will weaken national security unnoticed, he delivered a financial chain reaction in the halls of the Pentagon 'to the battlefields of Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon has already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress does not end up in the spending.
“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, leading to a so - called seizure, would lead to 23% across - the - board cuts and an end to many new projects.
“ Such a high level of reduction, carried out in such ill - considered way, most of our ship - building projects and unviable, you can not three - quarters of a ship or buy a building and other efforts to modernize seriously harm, ” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“ We would also be forced to part us from a large part of our civilian staff to separate and, since the reduction as soon would be implemented, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, the goal is to be achieved. ”
“ These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage. ”
The cuts were, in the end, the combat forces take, ” said Panetta.
“ While the Kriegszeitkontingente in the war on terrorism, by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the Grundbudget the Kriegsbemühungen adversely affect, ” Panetta warned.
“ Recruitment were to be cut back, leading to delays in the attitudes and the Einstellungsaufsicht, supporting the war. ”
“ The salaries of the staff would be cut, with late payments to Kriegszeithändler leads and the legal and political support would be disrupted. ”
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense.
“ The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world 's leading military power in the world. ”
“ We are strongly against these draconian action, ” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, they Panettas letter published.
“ This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly none of us should impose. ”
“ The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed. ”
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure on a compromise on the budget will increase or demands will increase the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience in the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he was the head of the Pentagon 'came, and I know that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister malte a gloomy picture, which might face a military shell, but without a core.
“ It is a ship without sailors. ”
“ It is a brigade without ammunition. ”
“ It is an air - without enough trained pilots. ”
“ It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are in a position to the mission, ” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
“ It is a force of morality and alert and is not in a position to provide it with potential opponents. ”
“ You can be a really angry. ”
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led Panetta new details, such as reductions of “ significant operational risks creating: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global work and Eingreiffähigkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen leading. ”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest Verteidigungsprojekte the removal could fall victim, including those that already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
That list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a proposed new Bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug, the Army and Navy, in need of the Humvee to replace.
The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years, up to save $80 billion, but the supporters say, an important next step in the build - up is, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
How a lie exposed
A look at today 's headlines shows how serious and widespread fraud and lie in day - to - day life.
The republican nominee for president, Herman Cain, is busy, and allegations of sexual harassment by several women Mr. both sides accuse each other of lying.
The leadership of Penh State is the Meineids accused, since they are supposedly reports has withheld, under which a retired Footballtrainer sexually abused young boys.
In the last week has been on an open microphone mitangehört, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the US President Barack Obama to claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers, shaking countries.
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he Verleugnungen - the very quickly by incontrovertible evidence refuted.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is the violations in the Kampagnenfinanzierung accused in connection with the cover - up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has experienced the media circus, the President Bill Clinton, when he during his second term in office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied.
Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers to their students the Prüfungsantworten set so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well launched.
Mentors, the opposite teach should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay.
How much deception we see?
As studies show, lie us every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as lies.
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying to us.
Lies to see or “ lies ” is a highlight, to learn for every human being is important, both for personal and also for professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as Scharaden away, where the goal is, “ who you! ”, this is a deception Enttarnen a serious knowledge, based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities have been collected, the wide - ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies exposed.
Lies a look in the eye.
You stottern, suffused with zappeln stammeln, and not always.
This may, however, are not that this liar difficult to detect and expose.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, when he heard about the structure of the claim, the subtle Gesichtsausdrücke, and timing is learning.
I have a couple of years spent the scientific results of the broad and ever - growing area of the passport to investigate, and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception a modern ability is easy to understand, and we in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world helps, especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good, other people to assess their interests and their own emotions to dominate and they intuitively sense that other perceived to be.
Thanks to the research, we know the extrovertierte people more often than people lying introvertierte that men are more likely to have “ selbstorientierte ” lies serving up than women, whose lies more in other “ follow ” - in the rule so that they want to protect the feelings that married people lying to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell lies, are usually “ fat ”).
We also know that, if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others are less feel guilty, this person to have lied.
As you can see whether someone is lying?
The first, by the normal behaviour that person.
This is known as the “ Baselining ”, the starting point.
It is a point of reference for the future assessment of changes.
You are watching the attitude, the laughter, the Stimmqualität their trial.
You should know better, when someone is normally constantly walking along, so that they do not unfairly, if it during a meetings with the foot along.
Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
When you look at these accumulations, the alarm bells ringing, not as proof of a passport.
People who deceive bogged down, perhaps, to try to their history, to recall, perhaps, their feet in the direction of the door or reject it in terms of the outcome, change their position in a significant way or show a “ relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch ”, that deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in the attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Asking the signal often wrongly, that a Einstellungsgespräch is over, only to this relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch.
You also look at the language you trial.
By Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her.
People can also be deceptive distanzierende language: “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman … Miss Lewinsky ” or if there is a question repeated knifflige in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “ qualifying language ” when they knifflige a question to answer is: “ now … to tell you the truth … as far as I know … in good faith. ”
In this way, the response will be more wahrnehmend as objectively, which often set the alarm bells ringing.
There is no Zaubermittel to Enttarnen of lies, but we can learn skills, thanks to a passport is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can fall prey to fraudsters are rare, both in the private - as in the workplace.
Plan a controversial oil pipeline will be delayed after exposure to US approval revised
A few days after the Obama administration, has threatened the approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico to delay, the trade unions and the dust settled at the same time angered environmentalists, is this the pipeline bauende companies sought the project to plan, so that we can go back to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday night that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in the Nebraska will reroute.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada, said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will be approved at the end of the day, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week, after which a decision is made on a Bundeszulassung for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of review that is the territory of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast - Unterwasserversorgung, meide.
“ This is a real step forward, ” said the Republican Party 's Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new Umweltüberprüfung, the State Department has ordered, may be postponed a decision until 2013, after next year 's election, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is the task of the State Department, and said his support.
The 1,700 - mile pipeline has been Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
You would 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
In this regard, the pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists they hate, but labour markets because they love, they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, the opposition to the plan, are weighing up the laws in order to move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation to force.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Foreign Office has found out that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says the Ministry Hauptprüfer a separate probe has requested the review process, which is focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist by TransCanada has been stopped, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that has been charged, the original study, an inappropriate choice, as it was with TransCanada.

The court approved for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of the analog to digital signals in recent years, is one of the world 's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico 's (SCJN), the Verfassungsklagen, by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, due to the lack of eight votes to Gesetzesanfechtung are needed.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, thought that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its powers to the decree - law with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial issued.
With this decision has been launched by the Senate rejected constitutional struggle for lack of qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court is on the constitutionality of or not, should decide the constitutionality of the law, it remains in force.
In the project for the complaint that by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the decree - law unconstitutional to explain, because for the radio and television in question the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible, so the decree - law the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
Only Zaldivar voted in favor of the project, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives Verfassungsbeschwerden against the decree - law a. after the adoption of the complaints followed the Minister Sánchez Cordero the decree - law no longer, and found all activities on the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected by the Chamber of Deputies complaint, failing in the debate about the project, for which the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister, not with the arguments of the project to agree, in the sense that the Länderregierung not with general provisions of the measures, the public administration to take control.
“ I do not believe that, if you do this, the independence of the regulator will not be affected, ” reminded us that for the strategic planning policies, such as the sector of the telecommunications, of constitutional law, the state government is responsible, because this is leading the state affairs.
The replacement of the analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes in recent years across the world, and it leads to a better use of radioelektrischen spectrum, higher quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age, which is a decision in the public interest is not the only technical aspects, “ because it includes economic, social, political and security issues. ”
Those issues, they said, “ making the action of the whole system needed, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state included a group of characteristics, which the Constitution in the hands of the central state government. ”
She called to mind that many countries around the world, the digital conversion already carried out, and on the government, even though they have highly specialised institutions.
It could not conclude that the government of the launching of the contested Gesetzesdekrets in the powers of Congress intervene, because of the legislative adopted laws would be respected, ” it said.

In this sense, the President of the General Consejo del Instituto de Electoral Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remember that just last November 9, the Wahlstelle a number of rules to harmonise the local rules with the reform of the federal states in by parliamentarians adopted.
It is important to remember that Michoacán neither his political constitution and electoral law nor its law on Wahljustiz to the reforms passed by Congress, so these in this round of not come into force, the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in Staatsanzeiger within the allotted time with the argument, nor any objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court ruled Mexico 's (SCJN) on the local legislature submitted Verfassungsklage and gauged the voice of the Staatsbeauftragten to the constitutional reforms as “ invalid and unlawful ”, because this does not have the right to “ decide or a veto it. ”
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview on the possibility of Einzelauszählung the voices that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM is the possibility that the local authorities the ballot papers partially or completely auszählen.
So can under the following conditions in one or more of the votes counted Wahlpaketen contained some of the results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the count and calculation is not aktenmäßig before or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission, or there are obvious mistakes or amendments in the proceedings.
In addition, the Gesamtauszählung the full ballot papers Friday if there is a difference between the winners and the alleged, in second place are the same or less than one percent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the party - or Koalitionsvorsitzenden, the second of the candidates.

On Wednesday, the new italian government
The Prime Minister designate Mario Monti, is meeting tomorrow with the president of Italy, that the new government will present to the crisis, the Italy to the edge of the Wirtschaftszusammenbruchs has led to provide answers to.
The Prime Minister designate Mario Monti, is meeting tomorrow with the president of Italy, that the new government will present to the crisis, the Italy to the edge of the Wirtschaftszusammenbruchs has led to provide answers to.
A statement from the Präsidentschaftspalast announced that on Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would be a blow to the formation of a new government.
It is expected that a majority of a cabinet of technocrats who will present, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would to the President of the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
“ I would like to express my complete confidence in the ability of our country, with this difficult time to be ready, ” said the former EU Commissioner of the journalists.
Monti confirmed not explicitly the formation of a new government, but from his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
“ The framework is now well established, ” he added.
Monti has it in less than three days, managed to form a government that is much less time than usual, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that the cost of the debt in an intolerable level.
The new, the former European Commissioner Mario Monti - led government needs to adopt a tough austerity package by the Europolitikern was called for the struggling to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush to Monti, reinforced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the italian government bonds for 10 years with 7% interest burden. this is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland will be forced to apply for the european rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Confindustria, the italian trade associations told the press after a meeting with Monti with: “ we said we would this government to support. ”
We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy from this state of emergency.
The chances of success of Monti 's been through the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who on Saturday as a result of the crisis had to resign significantly increases.
“ We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti, are designed to achieve good results, ” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre - right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because, so far, many of its members against a majority of technocrats existing government that Monti is currently is.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to implement the austerity measures is likely to be unpopular.
Opposition to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference, a failure of Monti 's is a disaster, also pressed.
Monti began Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as with youth and women 's organisations.
On Tuesday night, the session to be closed.
Monti was this Sunday by Napolitano, appointed as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion.
After a sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Mr. Berlusconi would have to resign as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister of the costs of the italian government bonds again critical borders.
A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the EU 's current rescue package.
Monti has said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, take, despite the predictions that the politicians give him time to implement the reforms, instead of bringing forward the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this only from engineers should be a reference to their concerns in the face of pressure from the financial markets imposed procedure.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from the political life difficult.

For more than 20 years, they have been expected, but the band, rest assured that, it is not a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The assured the Bassist Mitgründer and the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week by Brazil in an exclusive interview.

On this day, they are from 7.30 p. m. in the national stadium, together with the band the X in Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an extract from the conversation, the full transcript in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costaricanischen fans made a dream if Pearl Jam in Costa Rica is: are you aware of what that means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream, which can also be implemented for us.
This is just the second time that we are in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I am only once on holiday in Costa Rica. it is such a beautiful country, that we have a few days will stay there.
For us, it is exciting, our music out there.
I ask you, because the fans of the band completely. you see the closest days before the concert.
What tells her your begeistertesten fans?
Thank you, all these years on our side.
We have almost 21 years, until we needed to Costa Rica. thank you, waited so long to have and we are very sorry to have taken so long, until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the last 21 years off to have occurred in the last two weeks.
We have a few Riesenshows in Sao Paulo played and we hope that the us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have an appetite there to play.
We love this country, we like to surf and are from the jungle enthusiastic. in favour of Costa Rica to the best country in the world.
How did you Costa Rica and his surfing waves to come to know?
Many of our friend, kayak and I have a great friend in Tamarindo, where the waves simply unimaginable.
My friends are always on the surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. along with Mexico are excellent places to surfing. in this way, people who love the surfing, we have heard about it.
With a look at the tour 's Riesenshows with many songs.
What do you have plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Because that is where we never have played, we also have no borders.
We are going to try to make the best show to give with many different songs, we want a few songs from each album and play our fans and a good variety of repertoire.
Her repeatedly never your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is, in part, because we have nine records and more than 120 songs can play each other like. a song, so the decision as to which we will play, is not easy.
If we have two or three song, which we have not played the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us, because they remind us of the reasons why this song 's fallen, otherwise they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrating your twenty years of history.
If it looks back, you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, Total.
First of all, I think that none of us has advocated once in a great rock band to play, and this for over 20 years, which looks like a dream.
We are also to this blessing and it is great to still be able to make music together.
We love and we are thrilled to music.
We are in luck, to the places in the world able to travel, which we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
Which meant it for you, in the birth of Grunge participated actively?
It is always a privilege to this group of large band.
We are good with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.
Now and again, a band from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups at the same time from the same town.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle - group.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. we look forward, still with all of them to be a friend of mine and it does us credit, part of this that have arisen Seattle - Sounds.
It is also very unusual for a band like your with the same musicians so long zusammengeblieben.
Yes, four of us play for 21 years together and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us, this alone is much more time than many band in time.
First of all, I think that we are all happy, still alive, and also let us care about each other.
We are all close friend, which is why the musical ways have opened up for all the freedom to experiment.
A familiar to the other and the music, it could not be better.
Your relationship with the glory has not always been easy. on the other hand, why didn 'thanks to your success always do what their wolltet.
It will take place as a balance?
The way we are up to it has been made easier to find a balance.
We are safe, not too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to decline.
As long as we keep in mind that the people because of the music, reminds you of the fact that you get the music and what it has set up must respect, without keen to be a famous rock star to be; that has put us in any case never interested.
The memories you have in your other Mother Love Bone?
I think we have a very good song written at the beginning and it was great.
We were three years a band, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had issued a record.
We were disappointed, took so long to have, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD) with us the band built, a friend of mine when I hear a song or photographs see, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he me laugh. it was always a pleasure to work together to laugh and on music and football and many other topics to talk.
It was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that their work is aware of, in particular, Eddie Vedder and the band for the opening of selected have?
Yes, the production sent us videos by several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer, which will certainly exciting.
Why change her the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
By whom you be as Bassist influenced?
By so many +
Among the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski …
There are so many that I all afternoon on the Bassisten, I like to talk.
How has it, Pearl Jam, which did Grunge to keep alive, even though it is not a fad?
I think we all we do not feel very connected with the word “ Grunge.
When I think about it, the band fall to me, which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all the other came up at the same time, if they still are important, I think that is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band as Mudhoney now make music better than ever before.
First of all, it was their music blacker, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album, which could prove a bit lightly, but there are also other songs as the end or just Breathe, as the song 's very dark, even though they also something positive.
Both were in tears when I heard how Ed it played: they are very dark song.
I believe that if you are older and a little Traumatisches in your life happens, for example, if you have a family member or a friend loses - influenced the your artistic creation and your music, and these two song embody the clear for me.
However, I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music.

Twelve people left the building voluntarily yesterday at noon they illegally occupied and in the huge celebrations had organised the neighbourhood of the despair. the evacuation was made on judicial order without any police intervention.
The evacuation was the Türschloss change, not in order to avoid a similar situation.
“ From now on, the access control, ” confirmed the Hausverwalter.

In the lower echelons of three huge parties celebrating the up to two days have gone and the tenants to despair.

Park or mountain?
The architects, in addition to the bickering over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid - 1980 's, at the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge Park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the Park, in the eyes of many again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in the North - South spread, but upwards (mountains) and down (Sea).
The classification Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, served is no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was, as the city in September a Riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 competitions, for further Zugangstore after Collserola.
No doubt, a gateway to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone, gates into the country.
The question is: Collserola, parks or mountain?
The announcement is not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city of the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste, which is in the lift, can turn.
And it is this fact is the stuff of one of the rare common ground between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors, on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
“ It is necessary for Roldán, ” after the attack on the coast on the “ front of the mountains ”, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, not pregnancy.
“ We should start from the principle that Barcelona is the greatest Park beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, ” judging from the architect, for the title of “ the gates of Collserola ” a “ collective ” case: we must not “ as access to a park, but as a ring - fencing of areas in which we need to act. ”
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a “ intellectual challenge, ” the “ some risks ”.
Risks from the “ uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings with it ”, according to the experience in the 1980 's, in the area of the Forum of their “ swan song. ”
The first fear is the limit on what must be developed.
“ This limit always means, the next step ”, i. e. it.
“ We must think about new urban planning tools, because the current [with reference to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can become a real catastrophe. ”
Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplified, the side of Collserola towards Vallesana is, “ can be understood as a park, in the sense of not Barcelona ”, and for purely topografischen reasons.
Modol recalls that it has a study by the Patronat de Collserola that are not “ should fall on deaf ears, ” though he is grateful to the town hall that his body the opportunity in this project “ from the outset. ”
In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the town of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects, participate in the debate, even though he “ doubts ” to say whether this technical profile the first launched in multidisciplinary teams (“ exactly the right, ” he says “ we should guide) architects should only be a tool. ”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as in the offering of a global view of Collserola lacked: “ there were 16 competitions in the cross - section of advertised, ” he says, “ on the axis mountains - sea, but there are no Längsschnittperspektive the area seen in its entirety. ”
That has, at least in his case that led it to the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the Tors also clash.
In his view, should the city a guarantee that the strip of directly on the Dalt de Ronda, in all its length so that a soft transition between the town and the green belt.

If the aim of 500 - 600 Untersuchungspersonen is achieved, will the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south) Hauptstadtbezirks continued and in Morelos (in the north) Hauptstadtbezirks concluded.
He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said there will be three thousand seeks to ensure that children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the understanding and under the supervision of their parents food - related to fill out questionnaires.
You will also be questions about their physical activity, and their family Krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors, diabetes and renal insufficiency could lead to, to control.
He also that these Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), their blood pressure control and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes in connection with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López pointed out, this would take place at the concern of the health service personnel on the alarming weight gain of young people.
“ The Gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the percentage of obese 77 per cent of boys and girls from obesity to 47 per cent had increased, and the obesity has increased dramatically, ” said the expert of the IMSS.
He has said that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the mexican population from the other peoples unterschiede.
He stated that a (e) of Mexicans (in) on average to 65% indianisch - american, european and 30% to 5% of african origin is in their genes with diabetes and obesity, reflected.
In general, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus to us, the prospect of Energy (calories) to burn, so that those in the form of fat stored.
The researchers said the direct benefit to put research participants would be a full investigation into the children, in the states, whether this a level of obesity or obesity.
It would even the existence of dark Hautfalten on their backs and on Innenarm Akanthosis (), on the likelihood of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information would be kept confidential and the parents in writing from the doctors told the doctors say the parents all measurements and beat them lifestyle changes for the prevention of disease are appropriate.
Cruz López said that there would be three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: lack of exercise, the lack of movement in daily life, for most of the day in front of the television to spend and means of transport to use short routes, instead of walking.
The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales, bread, hamburgers, pizza, etc.), along with a high - fat and Eiweißaufnahme, as well as the field of genetics, which in this research project to be analysed.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevented bumps
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of chemistry in the mexican UNAM university developed with Polymeren Asphalte modified to the mix more resistant to weather and temperature changes to make
In the message, the road surface, respected, would it not be necessary, nearly 200 000 bumps to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the appropriate Asphaltbelags were to happen, the number of bumps significantly reduced or even fully be avoided.
In his presentation “ bumps from a technical point of view, ” he at the International Year of Chemistry, that he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing a similar to the asphalt mix, but more of a mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot, such as in some towns in the north of the country, should be used to the behaviour of the surface of improving the incidence of Schlaglöchern to avoid.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung is, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so - called Asphaltene - and the other is part of a low - the so - called Malthene. along the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behaviour.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, 120 degrees, it is very zähflüssig and almost 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures is crumbling.
“ This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but one day, depending on the weather and temperature change ”, the engineer.
The researchers FQ said, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface, which is made up of six Materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt.
Between the top layers are some Verschleißschicht from asphalt, from small, in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Every single piece of this Verschleißschicht, bathing in asphalt.
If the vehicles to travel and forces are produced, allows for this class is a good power in the road surface.
“ If it would be modified asphalt, would the forces is even more to distribute, ” said the engineer.
“ On the Verschleißschicht ”, he tells us, “ is a final layer, the so - called Tragschicht, from the tiny stones, i. e. of sand, also in the asphalt bathing.
Since this shift is in contact with the tyres are, they need greater force than the mechanical Verschleißschicht and friction.
The road surface this most forces receives and distributed, needs the Tragschicht also a proper thickness and the material from which it is, will need to be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature, are other important factors taken into account, and above all the water, ” he said, “ because it undermines the behaviour of the Verschleißschicht considerably.
If the terrain is wet, water in the class and is just back from difficult. created the weakening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of Schlaglöchern.
If a pothole ”, he said, “ will be the first Deckschicht flattened, while the Verschleißschicht only then will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of appropriate Wartungsprogramme maintained. ”
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Mexico 's innovation Investigadores (national) said that the Fahrzeuglast another important reason for the actions of Schlaglöchern. must therefore be the size of each layer on the surface is in relation to the Fahrzeuglast and it is important to ensure that to avoid frequent Schlaglöchern this rule will be met.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there are still many research would take, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries, even on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without using high temperatures repair.
What was lacking the candidate del Valle to the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impact that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia could not get.
El Valle receives his 14. Misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna, on the Gewinnerpodium, a Silberkrone and the bond, which it as the new Miss Colombia, addiction.
With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the Zeder in itself, is already on the 's Department of 14 Misstitel and Melina is linked to the legion of Valle del Cauca, the crown almost in the hands of. proclaimed to the Misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that arises today, many are asking is: what was lacking?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a large, the favorite in each trial had shown that they have everything for the new Miss Colombia. will not be in vain to Queen of the police force and for Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue was elected to the title, the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor that is as crucial for the decision by the jury, the first Miss to appoint, is that it is the answer to the question, “ what kind of book, you most and why? ” from Murillo Martín Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, who were not convinced.
The young woman from the author of Valle del Cauca replied:
“ I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of a civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, most of my childhood, the “ small ” Prince is a very deep book.
At the moment I read “ guilt and atonement. ” it is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a russian girl, a wonderful book, “ passions' says.
A response that did not like, firstly because of the term “ civilise 'and secondly, because it was not specific, had declared in what way each of her book, “ they had.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the result, “ the universe is wise, it is done and what has to happen.
And for all the people ask: lest a little “ small Prince. ” it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is high.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the Bevorzugte, all of which Beifälle einheimste and in the run - up to all get prices (catering competition, Oster Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte dressed and Reina Madre), “ the other candidates are jealous had made, what the Queen stresste, which therefore on the stage not shine. ”
And it noted in her first presentation to the swimming on the shore of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the Krönungsfeier.
Although they both appeared safe, but it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of the Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme “ Como en Casa ” in the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to been crowned Miss, “ shows that the candidate, the competition during the most prices wins, ultimately not Queen ”.
Valle was also at the end of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest in the social work not convince, which ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the make - up of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who is the social affairs of their country.
“ Beauty alone is enough for Miss Colombia. we need to look beyond the Körperliche, focusing on the social sense to focus on the fact that they are already taking part in the competition had worked on projects, ” she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis, is in the Magengegend said, had sinned. but this is inconsistent, because the jury chose it as a candidate for “ natural beauty ” with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Hernán Jorge Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body, that it would be better, “ but their problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest hard to say was, put their scoring on the last day. ”
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos the view that the mistake the woman of Valle del Cauca, the surgery, which they had been subjected to.
“ Operations are: ok, but Valle did not know how they can do it properly.
Your body is never a strong side here, and she has had to pay. ”
Because of this prize, which was the first time the national beauty contest that arose after the appearance in swimming a cruel to forecast the true in the night. it has been getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, so they do not benefit from the crown.
Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact is that their Herrschaftsjahr Melina from today, not as the Queen, but as a Princess, a position that will, on naming the national beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions.
But will it as one of the Queen, which despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, escaped the crown was to go down in history.
That was the work of the doctor, the body of Alfonso Cano identified
A Lophoskopist from Cali, as the man who “ Alfonso Cano ” identified in history.
The work of these officials is playing a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoskopist the fraud investigation unit, the Public Prosecutor 's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the head of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de FARC (Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: “ Alfonso Cano ” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had this week Eliazar González on call, a man from the Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations cooperate.
At the beginning of his career, González was working in communities of Chocó, where he often spent five days in the jungle had to go, the place to achieve, in which the bodies that were he to identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses he Lophoskopie, that is the study of the skin, the friction is exposed, i. e. the hand and Fußflächen.
In the week of the action against the so - called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out, clothing for at least three days only.
Nothing much - awaited him.
Friday night, it flew the helicopters after Palmira of Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that was the suspicion that one of the men, the oldest of the guerrillas of the world saw, could be why it should Zehnfinger - Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
He, however, with the Untersuchungste the place, in which the body found him, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures, which he had seen in the media, not in the slightest.
He did not have a beard, was like a farmer dressed, the area was no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don 't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a Taschenlampe Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the Abdruckblatt.
He was right: it was “ Alfonso Cano. ”
The same night, this from Puerto Tejada, the man in charge of defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, say that there is, in fact, the head of the FARC.
On Spurensuche
For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali, the tribute that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference about the use of “ Cano ” against that very important.
Many people are aware of our work is not.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which is a key factor in the break - up of a crime can be.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support in murder investigations and Raubsachen and confirm the identity of those arrested.
When they were arrested, many criminals false papers before or they do not.
We are taking the fingerprints and looking for this in the database.
The researchers told us that, when it comes to a theft of a piece of wall from a house down, as the thief had just at this point with his hand aufgestützt, one with jewellery and money fully gestopften Safe herauszog.
“ The walls are difficult, because its surface for fingerprinting are inadequate, but in this case, we were able to carry the imprint of the rest, and the criminals who participated in a number of thefts, identify, ” he reminded himself.
With the help of the fingerprints can also Mordverdächtige or discharged.
Recently, a death surrounded by Schnapsflaschen found.
The investigation was suspected that a family member tatverdächtig could be, and actually voted a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this is not guaranteed that it is the murderer, so it is with the place where the crime was committed, in context.
A Daktyloskopist the CTI declared that, “ the fingerprints of chemical and physical Reagenzen taken by the object. ”
If it appears, is a Pflanzkelle or a bond for carrying used.
Then the prints to Asif sent, that is the Verbrecherdatenbank, or to Personenstandamt.
“ The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented, ” declared the expert of CTI.
He said that not everything is so, as in the tv series SCI them out to be.
As gold is not all that glitters is also not everything that touches, a fingerprint.
But it can be used, if you have a relevant comparison.
The “ indignant ” call on the authorities in New York out
Hundreds of demonstrators were in tents on the 's Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the Räumungsbefehl came after and changed its location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday, the authorities in New York, when it with a court order again tried to the Manhatten - place to enter, after the morning after the place had been evacuated and have tried to another place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed the 's Zuccotti Square together, to whom it is with a court order, the “ indignant ” the renewed tents at this point, allowed to gain access to., meanwhile, is another part of the movement to the Räumungsbefehl and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests.
“ Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us, in the square to campen, we are in a different place come together and the battle with legal means at the return to the 's Zuccotti continue, with sit - ins and peaceful demonstrations, ” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement “ Ocupy Wall Street. ”
Bray said that the response of the “ outraged ” at the evacuation of its Zeltlagers directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, had been ordered to court, where Judge Lucy billings and symptothermic and other provisions, the forced evacuation of the square and prevented the protesters' tents approved.
In addition, occupied the “ indignant ” a new park, which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church.
You could place for at least one hour. but then met with the police, and arrested some of the demonstrators, although no precise figures Bray. he assured the Efe Agency, including several journalists have seen handcuffed.
The organisation assured me it would have been hundreds of people at this point returned, in which a group of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and communicating with the police arrived.
In the meantime, the 's Zuccotti Square (a compound in private property) closed pending a court hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday, and the legality of the morgengrauen that have taken place in the evacuation of analysis.
Some of the place - fueled protesters wore photocopies of this court order to themselves, and distributed it. you have made it even some policemen guarding the square, with “ some small clashes ” has resulted in Bray, as reported, the appropriate, some police officers have beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street by the place to clear and the use of “ laws, which were adopted after the occupation and ban, the protesters with their tents and other things that they had already used in the park return. ”
Mayor Bloomberg is in front of the press, clearly the result of this court order the re - opening of the square for the separation, and the protesters lifted. the demonstrators, he pointed out that the Stadtgesetze did not allow them to return to tents and Schlafsäcken in this place.
The mayor personally defended the morgengrauen carried out in the evacuation of the - 's Zuccotti Square, the almost 200 people were arrested, and it was decided, because the demonstrators “ not against the law. ”
Bloomberg said that he had the order to clear the square because this is “ in a place that had turned to the people not the Demonstrieren came but to break the law and, in some cases, in order to damage other people ” because “ some deals have received threats ” and the “ bangten residents about their quality of life. ”
“ The evacuation in the early hours of the morning was very attractive and shows that Bloomberg, in fact, the protection of the financial interests and not on protecting the interests of the north american workers is interested, ” added the spokesman of the movement that the mayor anschuldigte “ not to respect the freedom of the press. ”
The “ Occupy Wall Street ” informed that they thought about it, “ firm action ” on Thursday to organise, together with Gemeindeorganisationen and trade unions to the two months that the protests since the September 17 now take to commemorate.
Pamela Anderson is in the tv Weihnachtsshow the Virgin Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other canadian celebrities will be on 1 December in the tv programme, “ it 's a Russell Peters Christmas ” occur
The canadian citizen, Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistant in “ Home Improvement ”, Rettungsschwimmerin in “ Baywatch ”, rabbits in “ Playboy ”, the wife of the Rockmusikers Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model in a canadian television Weihnachtssendung of the Virgin Mary.
The private television channel CTV, today announced that Anderson, along with the “ crooner ” (Balladensänger), Michael Bublé and other canadian celebrities on 1 December in the tv programme, “ it 's a Russell Peters Christmas ” and it is a very special Virgin Mary breathe life into.
CTV widespread today images of the television programme, in which Anderson - which is also for the spread of the Internet itself a gedrehten porn in which they, along with her former husband, the Mötley Crüe Schlagzeugspieler of “, ” Tommy Lee, appears to be the Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap of the Jesus to form.
In the scene, Peters, a well - known canadian comedian of the indigenous origin, recently as a moderator in “ My violent torpedo of Truth ” of Charlie Sheen, worked as a Jesuskind.
The Weihnachtsprogramm of CTV requires not only to Anderson and Peters, also on the canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March in Buenos Aires, Argentina 's model Luisana Lopilato, married and this controversy is not far away.
Recently, Bublé in one of his concerts in New York, the Nordamerikanerin Kim Kardashian as a “ whore. ”
Japan after the earthquake is reborn
The GDP growing by 1.5%, thanks to the Inlandskonsums and stop the cycle of a free fall from the beginning of March
Since the last March, the japanese economy paralyzed, which are still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which in a nuclear crisis einmündete, and the worst catastrophe that Japan is the second world war had seen.
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo rated the material damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow, despite the difficult global economy to weaken.
After three quarters of case, the details of the gross domestic product from July to September, finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% in the previous quarter and by 6% on the year hochgerechnete quota.
In the second quarter, as value - in Japan marks the beginning of the financial year in March 2012, is also the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the Maschinenverkauf for rebuilding from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas.
In fact, the company increased its investment by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for capital investment, from January to March was recorded, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
However, the real change to the japanese economy not only from keynesian incentives, the advantage of the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Woke up Japan in particular, thanks to the development of the Inlandskonsums, the current 60% of Japan 's GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, launched by the increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, after the yen, Japan 's currency, in one of the “ Zufluchtswährungen ” of investors' from the debt crisis in the euro zone and the dire predictions for the U. S. a., a privilege as a tombstone one day in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency are the products more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy on the health of the great Technologieproduzenten is based.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September at the quotation of the yen.
While the markets continue to the peripheral european countries under siege, remains the government Yoshihiko Noda vigilant.
“ We must pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example, the deterioration in certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen, ” said yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states in September clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development there.
The indicator that the turning points in the world economy vorausnimmt, brought to light that, in the largest Wirtschaftspotenzen put the brakes.
Because he fell by four - tenths to rid 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average rate of 100 is, after eight - tenths on 99,13 points has fallen.
Athens can again doubts
Papadimos says that the austerity measures were passed, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the amount of fuel in the risk premiums of the peripheral countries and broad historical uncertainty strays Greece continue to be in the labyrinth of that from the european debt crisis.
The impression that the “ consensus ” in the new greek interim government is more of a response to pressure from Brussels is as a real conviction of the political forces, is slowly by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that when he was appointed agreed a hundred days may be too short for its implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Village, Antonis Samaras, the new austerity measures and not support his call for new elections to the planned date of February 19, will be back.
“ The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October were taken, ” assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government will reach its climax.
A package of 24 programmes for employment, to reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication, the doubts about his attitude is, “ we have to support the transitional government committed, but otherwise, to nothing. ”
The conservative leader was a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that the 8,000 million, the Athens entsperren. must urgently needed, he made it clear that he has no commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures would approve.
But the European Commission, which is due to the impact of Pokerspiels with Papandreu referendum still is irritated, confirmed yesterday, at their request is not changed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main greek political parties “ a clear written agreement as soon as possible ” to sign up.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the troika inspectors “ very soon ” after returning to Athens with the new government to talk about, “ what for the payment of the sixth tranche ” of 8,000 million euro, “ is needed ”, although it is not a final date.
The greek tangle, even for a while.
Queen Sofía: “ these are tools for progress and hope ”
The Queen has stressed the “ dominant ” position in relation to this type of Spain
“ Spain has a dominant position in the role of the Kleinstfinanzierungen ”.
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain in the past two decades, the world for the second donors for this money on international cooperation, have developed the “ essence ” is based on the fact that it is a “ tool for social progress, for justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of faith in the people. ”
The Queen weihte yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro - credit in Valladolid. she was convinced that there is “ no doubt ” that is that this kind of deals “ absolutely essential ” would be in order, by the United Nations by 2015 set Jahrtausendziele to achieve and “ in particular the aim, the number of people with incomes of less than $1 a day have to live below the poverty line, so “. ”
“ Spain continues to work ” in extending the Begünstigtennetzes “ down to the last corner of the world and it brings in this task by responsibly, ” said the Queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiatives and the contributions of the summit, until Thursday, the outcome will be, “ the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest, and particularly for women ” as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
“ We have a number of successes ” and “ there are many challenges ahead. ”
The summit on micro - credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to initiate “ two fundamental goals ”.
The Queen has said that it will seek to that by the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families access to these services have to, and that 10 million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of the micro - credit is in Spain and the rest of the world by Muhammad Yunus “ years ago launched way ” back to the Queen Sofia as an “ act of justice and recognition ”.
The father of this financial instrument, described it as a “ admirable idealists, who is committed to the fight against poverty, ” and his work for 15 years, they know as the Queen Bangladesh after travelling to the Darlehensstrategie on the ground.
This experience has been followed by a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 at all. “ we have the continued development of seeing, ” declared the Queen, whose commitment to this project their yesterday the assessment as “ head of the family ” in Valladolid, and as a spokesperson for the poor ”.
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her speech by the House to take part in the debate and search for solutions in the fight against poverty Drunk.
“ Ethical imperative ”
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that “ an ethical imperative ” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to aid in times of economic boom to tie, because it was a “ lasting commitment. ”
Jiménez were of the opinion that the micro - credit a “ serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty, ”, and that the governments of the developed world is now “ more than ever ” for solidarity of criteria, and not allow that the solidarity of the falls victim to crises.
For Spain, the micro - credit is one of the “ most important forms of development aid ”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the “ success ”, “ marginalised ” people, “ the always closed doors, ” “ hope ” and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, said the present in a city, welcome to the “ their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity ” is to be opened.
The CDU is proposing that the EU president due to general vote to choose
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and head of the christian democratic party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not included in the programme, but, in the autumn of enforced, particularly those activists would be enough to make the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
In the Bureau Präsidentschaftsantrag proposed by the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine voted against it, ten had abstained from the vote.
The several minutes - long standing ovation, on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro - minded finance minister, no doubt.
The Hauptidee the Chancellor, as well as the subsequent Antrage slogan: the answer to the crisis is “ not less, but more Europe. ”
Not only because Europe peace means, but also as “ nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on. ”
For the Chancellor is “ the time for a breakthrough in Europe ”.
This could be through more control of the European Union reinforcing overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone to come, as well as it could, however, in the election of the president of the European Commission, on the basis of a general vote lead ” to Europe a face ”.
However, this is definitely one of the approved by Congress, which clearly Antragsvorschläge Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 soon on this revolution: some Groβ - Britain, is opposed to the cause, and the Leitenden believe the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone, however.
Likewise, the delegates in a vast majority of the proposal of the weighting of any country in the ECB 's Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, rejected what appears to be a more powerful the position of Germany.
The playing of the climate within their party of rediscovering the German Chancellor has therefore points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. it has, however, is no longer the Congress at the expense of the “ small ” or in difficulties european countries to win, the delay in Germany are criticising arrogant.
As far as the Europe - request the relevance of the “ Franco - german ” a clause, calls on Angela Merkel France not to the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this serves as a reminder that, Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud at Krankmeldungen?
After the family benefits take (UMP) and the government now Krankmeldungen in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, arrive for a visit Familienbeihilfekasse and made a speech on the already - since 2007 has always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as economic dependence on the state.
This attack to accompany the of the will, the economy in a Härteprobe, on the other hand, not just as a harbinger of the axis of the right - wing presidential campaign, will the majority on Arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen focus.
First, with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a Krankmeldung by workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company the pay of four days, would lose, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, “ Les echoes ” threatens to provoke anger, however, would help, 280 million euros.
And with a different Maβnahme more symbolic nature: the state officials were accompanied by a unvergüteten Karenztag in Krankheitsfalle give (so far they have, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).
Meanwhile, these questions in the debate, sparked the majority also anew the Betrugsthematik, this time at the Arbeitsabsenz associated with abuse are targeted.
“ Inspections will be much more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if this is called for, ” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 before the microphone to the station RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this news about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive, the most common have borne fruit.
The French are not more ill more often than those elsewhere in Europe.
However, our first in the nation - wide paragraphs.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM were in 2006, more than EUR 237 million Tagesabfindungen paid off.
The Gemäβ Wirtschaftsforschungs Dokumentationsinstituts - and the health system, the Tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of the health - care costs.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as industrial accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube, the heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And so, 2.5% of health spending.
In the year 2010, the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting group, on average, only 14.5 Krankentage granted.
An average of certain differences covered up, a different, in 2007 of monster. com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 000. surveyed, french workers, not a single Krankentag had.
Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of the Krankmeldungen in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, between 15% and 15 days a month ago, 15% of between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared with its european neighbours, the french workers is not more than elsewhere to disability benefits.
A in 2010 by two researchers of the french state, Centre for Wissenschaftsforschung (CNRS) - led long - term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote (away - or otherwise justified) oszillierte, in France, between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud at Krankmeldungen is a very small proportion on the black market.
On the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved.
The encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that it controls on systmatische Krankmeldungen are 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 000 of past, short - term Krankmeldungen, the heiβt in 37.050 cases ”, abusive or too long. ”
In the systematically controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days the long term if you were among 1.2 million 11% of “ unangepassten or unjustified ” cases, heiβt 132.000.
Overall, this is 169.000 “ unjustified ” cases to millions of workers, a Krankmeldung.
A paragraph, the only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, that of the undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of one published in July Sachberichts with regard to this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro Steuergewinnausfall per year, i. e. more than the total cost of Tagesvergütungen, and thus far more than the Defraudation that.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new Anpassungsplan
A new Greece 's adjustment programme to absorb its economy needed.

The implementation of the occasion of the Eurogipfeltreffens on 27 October decisions to be the “ primary task ” of the new government because the participation of the country in the euro area “ at risk ”, he added.
According to M. Papademos has planned, the budget deficit is the country “ to the 9% ” of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after this 10,6% in 2010 and in 2009 with 15.7%.
The rights rejected the new Sparmaβnahmen from
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right - wing, had on Monday gave its approval to the already approved Maβnahmen on one of the escape from the debt crisis superficial attempt, however, said that his party was no additional Sparmaβnahme prepared erkären.
“ We are not in favour of new Maβnahmen vote, ” he said at an assembly of his party, the new democracy.
He had been with the requirements of the reduction of its budget deficit and debt agreed, as well as in the fight against the waste, though, it was hostile to any policy that the economic recovery would stop.
Olli Rehn, with economic and Währungsaufgaben betrauter EU Commissioner, which prevents that EU and IMF loans through the necessary 8 billion euro, not without a written guarantee by all parties, on whose support the planned Maβnahmen release, Antonio Samaras responded that his word is enough and he is under pressure from Auβen sign.
Euthanasia and assisted Freitod must be legalised, a panel of
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best allows funding, and this, too, of the cases of cancer alone.
The canadian company is living in a recipe to the death.
Only 9% of Canadians who are, in fact, with their doctor to speak on the conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report of the Royal Society of Canada, to the six experts were involved in various disciplines, among other things, ethics, law and medicine, are related to each other.
This panel recommends the government, so the penal code to amend assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia, where this election, and in patients than in the situation, to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent survey of the independent society EIU, the Todesqualität in 40 countries of the Erdballes compared with each other.
Although Canada is in the 10th grade centers, the study noted that “ the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death ”.
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts.
And despite the desire of the majority of Canadians, at home to die, die, however, ultimately 68,6% of these in the hospital.
The whole country standpoint, the rate of 86% of deaths that have occurred in the hospital in Quebec.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the author of the report 's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which already has geäuβert, no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide to make, entgegengerichtet.
But now we have, according to the experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected, the approach of euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide or have decriminalised, no evidence that such a decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting people.
On the contrary we encounter much more cases of such breaches in the countries in which euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide is not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a signatory of the report, in a teleconference confirmed.
“ Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is illegal. ”
“ Also assisted suicide is in Canada, although it clearly illegal, ” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of the euthanasia
Let us remind us that, according to a 2010 carried out - Angus Reid poll already 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had, as they are of the opinion that these people would like to make it at the end of your career, to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of a euthanasia does not have to deliver the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled people less value besäβe.
In terms of the people who have an assisted suicide, represented the 41% of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted.
What maintenance or suspension of funds in patients, as the situation is less clear, as the author of the report.
Similarly it in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis suggests that in the penal code should be indicated that the possibility of making the funds, for the rejection of a legal have been before, not a criminal.
The panel also calls for health care professionals in the job training should be a possibility of making money on the end of life to respect, and that without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked, for the best allows funding, and this, too, of the cases of cancer alone.
Least calls for the body to the measures already in the canadian institutions to far - reaching health - care means used to pain relief lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen or, at the very least, to consider, as these nor the euthanasia served to physical pain to reduce and this on the same procedures bezögen.
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the area of health care have expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Expertenberichts the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Gesundheitsrecht, the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts, among other things, as “ an extremely ”, because this Euthanasiepraxis in patients in the final stage of no borders.
“ This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone, the lebensmüde and older than 18 years, is a different person to ask him in his suicide to help, ” RA Deschamps, the yesterday a summary of the report looked at.
RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report, the ownership of the individual over all other values, in the social Gewirke of society are involved.
But now, he says, there would be “ guidelines and commitments in a society. ”
Margaret Somerville, specialist for Gesundheitsrecht, also has a “ strong opposition ” to the conclusions of the report expressed, which they call the “ pro - euthanasia - manifesto ” described.
Margaret Somerville, even a member of the Royal Society of Canada is, in particular the Berichtsangaben casts doubt on freedom of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and legalising assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Energy policy:
Facts about dogmas should win
There is a matter that is not on the basis of short - term considerations or emotions cannot be dealt with, it is, of course, the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity influence in direct Maβe purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to Wahltreffen a reason to take on this issue, as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit, if they all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data footing.
Although 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by the year 2050, is not a huge share of the world 's population at a vital element to give up.
At the same time, it must be the scarcity of fossil resources, in order to continue consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, of course, from the environmental debate lost subject to forget to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany continue in its isolation, on nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which his decision, the need for a substitutionsfähige Ersatzquelle, nor in Switzerland that is barely intends to only nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, are just a few of the States, to continue to pursue their projects against it with determination.
The United States, for their part, have decided their Park after Fukushima, another, by after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident set aside to work again in operation.
Even at the renewable energy sources, and german model occasionally as an example, is, however, the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in the passed, one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, an increase in the gas - and coal - fired power stations - made CO2 emissions.
The whole of this unfortunate effects will be within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, european Tabellenführer on wind energy, from which it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, in turn used with wind energy, which are its CO2 Ausstösse, as well as his Elektrizitätspreis around 65% and 50% higher than the european average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbors in contrast to our french households by 40% higher Elektrizitätsrechnung.
As the price of energy in the global economy a key role of competitiveness, as well as a Stabilitätspfand industry at home ground, the french companies because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in the use of nuclear power would be a strong increase in electricity, which the noble statements about the re - industrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of the illusion will liesse.
Polls showed that a price is the very broad, the majority of the french nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of the energy source.
Let us remind us that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs.
Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings it a whole lot of specialised of small and medium - sized enterprises on international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs.
France should the decision to exit from nuclear power, as would a Groβteil these SMES are victims, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced.
What an electrician would work to sixty years designed EPR if the decline in its producers is pre - ordained?
The energy equation to resolve we must accept that it was also a little like the work of the devil a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
Developed by the company Areva, low - carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level to maintain for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their Arbeitsteams, which, because of their professionalism made a name, are from the Sicherheitsvorstellung just obsessed.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has three serious accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, is under normal operating conditions; so was he without consequences for people and the environment.
At Chernobyl, the drama and Reaktorkonstruktion unendschuldbares, human error caused.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry is also the lessons to learn from this accident, as it did after the two previous had done.
As a result of this process, and the cooperation of the security forces of the french and german operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR, a draft of the resistance to such things.
Under the Elektrotechnikern as desirable is considered a nuclear power plant to build, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition by EDF and Areva, giving them free rein liesse, the lead in the inevitable Kernkraftentwicklung to reissen.
It is necessary and legitimate, the best Energiebouquet for our country to seek, however, it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogma and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate so economic, social and financial situation of the country determined.
Is immigration burden or chance for the economy?
The of Nicolas Sarkozy 's immigration policy has been criticized from many corners - of - police, judicial and governing bodies, as a result of the figures derive policy, a combination of this policy with the status of a “ country of human rights ”, as France call themselves.
Recently, the foreign students directed against harassment of administrative side the Wochenschauen marked, the interior minister had in passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France “ no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad need. ”
But this policy was rarely, from an economic point of view.
On this issue is a wide consensus between right and left.
By right - wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, the mood in 1976 had stated that, “ 000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, it is not a problem for a country should be, ” by left - wing side by Michel Rocard, the 1990, France had expressed “ could not the whole of poverty in the world. ”
One difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of national land by hordes of polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and left.
By both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the french society.
The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit, be towards immigrants are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite, the co - development would like it, our “ Contrary to resolve. ”
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may be on the elections effect; but it is economically costly.
As the economists and Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work, the latest findings on the immigration together (Exceptional People: how Migration Shaped our and our World Will Define Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.) among the specialists, there is a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood on economic growth, jobs and wages in the destination.
The immigration would limit the growth of calm and the labour market.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that this risk, the indigenous workers, particularly the less skilled, substitutes, putting pressure on their pay.
However, experience shows that the migrants in fact much complementary than than the local grounds, as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet.
The low - skilled immigrants working in sectors, the local grounds little annoy, the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply line.
Positive Lohneffekt
As well as a surgeon difficulties would have in a country to work, where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri, in this way, calculated that a 1% disabled rise in the flood of miteinbezogene, a long - term increase in wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe.
And this does not take into account the fact that the of the immigrants' s diversity of Ideenschöpfung, as well as the economic growth is the (high proportion of immigrants from naturalized american Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been of immigrants founded).
The migrants are also a net to the social security system, in european countries, on average, for a total of about 1% of the entire budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that one at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget, on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus spending) of the 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the intersection with the lack of “ teeth ”.
Question teeth, the immigrants would shock, however, exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has a democracy, so it remains, european democracy to rethink
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate asset.
The european continent itself should remind you who is after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the whole of the 20th century the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, the gulag, but also in Franco 's Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece has had to endure.
Some were believed that it would be sufficient, the right to vote, to representative possible way to democracy once and for all of their enemies will prevail.
We know since Napoleon the “ small ” that it is a feature of the state of mind.
The general right to vote, the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can just as well for the “ repression ”, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers, and control a training, education, economic and social spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and, first and foremost, political and democratic crisis.
The attitude of the greek Wahr - wrong - referendum would have been in this regard twice: once the insightful nature of the need for a strong return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the alarming sense of their inability to deliver their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today have shifted, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer moving in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, to the success of the national referendum, which, depending on the needs and in or order was organised.
A Freischein for the european or a giant leap with their eyes in the hollowness of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the citizens.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from right, clear and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at the european level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, incidentally, has already no longer, where the list to end - as it is only a single crisis, and that there is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, the dictates of the markets and rating agencies prevents that under his impotence and his Solidaritätsmangel suffers.
It is the whole of Europe, which humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about Souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and every single one of the nations connected him.
The urgency is the sovereignty of the leadership of the european project back.
Because it is on the set, whether the Europeans the burden of debt reduction from the markets to a future through investment at hand.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at the european level on the condition that is not complete without democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be passed without sure to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time to tackle, today, one in the european economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy, as they have in mind - present, would be a new folly and another dead end.
We need a new stage of european integration.
In the Republic of France to create, it took the fact that Republicans to “ create ”.
The revolution of the interests of alone, it is not enough.
This instruction is still valid.
On the economic front, we need a more integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe, creating a truly european sovereignty.
We need Europeans to Europe.
“ Kontaktlose smart cards are to the common good ”
The Weltmesse for smart cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude of their doors.
The year 2011 should according to Eurosmart actually with an 11% increase in global sales of Mikroprozessorchips (EC - cards, SIM cards - phone), with more than 6 million units sold.
The tragendste segment here is the kontaktlose technology, the payments in public transport or settling of purchases made possible by simply the card to a reading.
With the one year before sold 320 million should this year 460 million kontaktlose smart cards sold around the world.
Its market share in 2012 should increase further (580 million expected units) and about 10% of the global Chipkartenmarktes (6,925 million cards represent).
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment to ground after it for a long time, the Asia - Pacific region hinterhergehinkt.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, 000 Zahlungsterminals and accept this.
In France, the more modest beginnings: only 400,000 kontaktlose Visakarten were widespread.
The consumer markets, however, steam.
Carrefour has therefore this year, 2.5 million kontaktlose passport MasterCards.
In order to move higher speed, it is now imperative that the banks' customers with these cards.
“ Two very broad french financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in the future that systematically bank cards with chip kontaktlosem peppers, ” announces Gérard Nébouy, Director - General of Visa Europe to France.
Test banks pay by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the road to the payment of the future: a mobile phone.
A very small percentage of equipment is so far with the implementation of these transactions necessary NFC technology (“ near Field Communication).
“ You are in default. ”
“ But they should at least next year a real trend. ”
“ We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide, ” says Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The, Credit Agricole yesterday, the start of a Testlaufes in Caen received announced by December by next June will be done.
The iPhones some 200 customers and staff, a capsule that would enable kontaktlose payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale had yesterday, the market supply preparing their customers kontaktlose payment by mobile phone.
Terroristenfront goes without saying, of the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is about the relationship between al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The already long under suspicion of the relations between the terrorist group al - Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the nigerian sect Boko Haram appears to confirm.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice - Auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel itself acknowledges that Algiers now about “ certainty acquired. ”
“ The way in which both organizations to act, and the relationship of the intelligence services, point to a clear cooperation, ” he said, without going into detail.
Paris seems a similar analysis.
The investigation on the last January kidnap two frenchmen in Niger have interfaces.
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the kidnapped Aqmi Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should the following day at the same time as a number of their captors during an operation carried out by french special forces getöten.
French and nigerian investigators want in the rubble amongst several Telefonchips have found that the terrorists.
Terroristenachse
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several groups in Mali, Niger and Nigeria are stationed.
According to Radio France International (RFI) would like to know the investigator, in particular, the numbers of two partners: a number of leads to a Nigerian who for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram stopped; the other leads to a man who, as the Aqmi and close to the sect.
“ This is a step forward, we must, however, there is no doubt await clearer evidence before it from an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem can speak. ”
“ However, it is conceivable. ”
“ We know for years that the sect of financial and intellectual support of Auβen, and that this is becoming increasingly active ” shows, moderates the nigerian Kunle Amuwo researchers.
In the last few months, that “ assistance ” in the course of ever more obvious, as is the speeches and the Operationsmodi of Boko Harem, now on the Hinzuziehen of suicide bombers, as well as the use of always complex explosives, the same mark as those who Aqmi have been used.
The international community to start in Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja, there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The nigerian authorities have the grouping, in fact, for a long time as a community of Illuminaten, deemed the no particular attention should be.
Faster success
In the 2002 in Maiduguri in environment of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, founded in Haoussa Boko Haram, which means “ western education is a disgrace ”, following the establishment of an islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region by the association of rapid successes.
You are claiming politicised and strict adherence to Sharia law, while their connected activists in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in their sights.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram with their increase in attacks against the run police stations have been particularly active.
The response from Abuja, however, is as usual indifferenziert.
The army surrounded the city, it has 800 deaths.
The captive took Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the radical sect getting in and out of their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, known to attack in Jos, the 80, then to a further in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram blamed a Selbstmordattentates allocated to the security police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations to international priority target.
The formation of a Terroristenachse in Africa, from Mauritania in Nigeria to Somalia is concerned, since all the security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger occupied, Somalis in Kenya by al - Shabaab, Boko Harem seems to operate a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week hatta Alain Juppé — a Gespräches with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Boko Harem warned and shown their willingness ” to tell all the evidence. ”
The world of the republican presidential candidates gemäβ
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China 's, Iraq, and support for Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world, with simple, not to say: stupid ideas?
If the republican presidential candidates, listening to voters in almost this impression.
For a few days to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades - in - arms thundering their statements, and their statements regarding the Auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and the Israel - aid, often in any way - based slogans.
In terms of the appointment of the “ Grand Old Party ”, is the highest in the course of the Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to the WTO and they quote the “ currency manipulation ” - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia on Äuβerste would prefer not to accuse.
Stupid gone, if this is the introduction of a trade war is to imply, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate, the vision of a mature Auβenpolitik seems to have, almost in terms of the conduct of the emotions schmeichelnden strangled.
He had a full - blooded, but constructive Gesprächsaustausch with Beijing (also called on the current position of Obama 's).
But Huntsman is not heard, because he was in the depths of the opinion polls is stagnating.
Reagan 's equal
Romney also had military strikes against Iran praised, if sanctions to talking the Nuklearprogrammes fail.
“ Should I am elected, and an I stop Iran ”, he had on hearing.
“ Obama is re - elected, they get the bomb. ”
Auβerdem he has greater military promised to help Israel and Obama charged that partner commitments guilty of having remained.
The businessman Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, for its part, a shameful Aktenunkenntnis on display.
Recently, he shouted to the chinese Militärbedrohung cons, as Beijing “ is trying to develop a nuclear power ” and appeared in the fact auβer to that China has since 1964 in possession of military Atomarwaffen!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry of Israel and military strikes against Iran, äuβert, for its part, ready to be the american army in against drug cartels in Mexico.
Obama 's 2009 banned use of Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also of Cain, Perry and the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a long way from John McCain, the republican candidates in 2008, a auβenpolitischen emphasis.
The current Präsidentschaftskontrahenten, Reagan had also simple ideas, and in spite of all that won the Cold War.
They call to mind the fact that Obama also selbstein amateur, and water in its wine to be had, with regard to the issue of anti - terrorist.
You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “ boys ” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, but also the reputation of the weakness.
These Anfeindung, however, is not quite so freely.
The population estimates the more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, the Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq careful not to military intervention, the clog up.
And Obama surprised by appropriate, he argues that America needed to economically to be rebuilt in its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe directly with Russia, has been in operation.
You should gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Russia 's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to this event with pomp and circumstance.
More than 500 geladene guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung Feinschmeckerbuffet and in the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, Russia and Germany below sea level.
German Chancellor Merkel Angelika, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolischerweise together the tax the Ventils, which the russian gas to western european network.
With the new gas pipeline to additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas a year by the first pipeline of 1.224 km to the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg - western Pomerania, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which is a Gesamtlieferung of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the french total consumption - allowed, to the end of 2012 will be completed.
And it has the possibility of the construction of a third line of which led to themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge Bauwerkes as a victory.
The project has been in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested.
The Nord Stream pipeline is a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in preventing any Trassenverlaufs through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.
For that reason, these two countries a little of their power: for them, it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia, by threatening to gain access to western european markets, to close down.
Warsaw, most in the debate, was not to be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a “ new german - sowietischen pact ” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.
Western Europe has to support this russian project an even higher security of supply.
But at the expense of starvation of a european energy, because the project is blazing a trail between West and East Europeans.
Russia has it in barely five years ago, to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out.
“ This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, organic way links, ” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out, to what extent the groβen Gasverträge, also of political and economic is important.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom 's managers about the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of the pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The Unterwasserleitung is made from steel with Betonummantelung before Schiffsankern to protect.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, in about 200 metres deep.
In its construction had from the Second World War previous minefields to be tackled.
“ Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution, ” Jens Müller, the spokesman for the society Nord Stream.
Auβerdem had increased Maβnahmen for the Protection of flora and fauna.
The line is a long line of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme over the entire length of nothing is interrupted: “ neither outlets, still Wartungsstationen.
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project have refrained from taking, as the little Sweden were eager, a russian public company on permanent way to settle their coasts.
“ In the event of an accident we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute, ” stated Mr Müller.
In the event of a leak in the pipeline leaks out of the gas in the air.
This case is of designers, however, is likely to be seen as a little, since the Schweiβnähte on consistency of a leak per 100,000 years been estimated.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline, both by a robot submarine, the external Observationszwecken by a Seeschiff from is managed, as well as by a device, in the heart of the pipeline is circulating.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, is in the heart of the pipeline and gas pressure by the move.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when they arrive very specific information about possible deformations in the metal.
The pipeline was designed to 50 years to work, without the slightest repairs will be subjected to.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This 200 cash to the access - 100 cash to the Austrittsstelle.
Five companies have to implement this project their forces.
The Leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, the 51% of the shares.
Still, it is the german companies E. ON and BASF attached to the (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the french Firmengruppe GDF Suez (ever to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is especially effective.
Gazprom has this society, then the whole of the capacity of their Gastransportes rents out, on renewable twenty - year agreements.
“ Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how groβ from transporting the quantity of gas is real, ” stated Mr Müller.
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus was to 30% to 70% of shareholders and by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, gewiβ, their expenses to recoup, with Gazprom alone the liability.
The pipeline is on a sandy, with Kiefern forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 - meter - high outlets are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measure, temperature, pressure and other indicators of the gas, arriving before this in the german gas pipelines will be passed.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal with a million cubic metres of russian gas supplies verstreichende per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a Markennotizbuch.
By an italian companies about 15 years ago, would like to Moleskine now the letter back new style.
It has a flair of adventure by candlelight, with the letter zugebrachte hours.
The Notizbuch of Moleskine is easy to see, with its black, rechteckigen cover, his elastic, the eierschalfarbenen sides, as on the time aged.
The Moleskine Notizbuch, as it is now known, however, is in 1997.
The italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan has decided, at the time a distinguiertes Designnotizbuch on the market.
Maria Sebregondi Fachberaterin, at the time of the company, is with the introduction of the new product.
The Notizbuch was of a traditional production technology, called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which inspired a Baumwollack described, for example, for salaries of Polsterbänken is used.
This type of Notizbuch was among writers and passengers would be much appreciated.
“ Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten the subject would revive, until the twentieth - century icon avantgardistischer artists was, ” explained Maria Sebregondi, now Markenverantwortliche in Modo Modo.
The success of a.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales by 26% and establish a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine happens the italian border, and will be implemented in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to a Phantombild the buyer, because the Notizbuch as businessmen, as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of more cosmopolitan, cultured and offengeistiger customers.
The small, italian companies, the 12 staff in its early days, was today employs more than 100 employees and has since 2008 on two offices, one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops on Internet portals such as Fnac, small boutiques in the city centre and goes to its identity.
“ We are the spirit and his new Schreibbedarf followed, which, despite the recovery of the e - mails, ”, said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural Charakterzug will by the development of the company Moleskine accompanied: recently, the exposure of a brand called “ Detour ” (a) launched in the architects and artists to turn out their own notebooks.
In August, the company at the film festival in Locarno also cover with Leopardenmuster on the market.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural map, and then make its products to diversify: pockets, calendar, pen, Computerhüllen … the brand, the entire range of articles.
A success, Neider on the plan: in the fall of 2006 was Modo Modo by Investmentfond SG Capital Europe, today 's Syntegra Capital bought, and proposed that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled people in such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are to find a job.
Today marks the start of the “ 15. week of work for disabled. ”
Despite a purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is for disabled people always twice as high as the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population of unemployment.
Discouraging?
“ No, it stressed Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the “ week of work for disabled ”. ”
“ In 15 years of progress. ”
“ At the time, it was the unemployment rate, not twice, but three times as high. ”
“ Nichtsdestotrotz remains enormous amount of work to be done. ”
It has to be said, however, that the unemployed for disabled many obstacles remain before they get a job.
It is more often the elderly: 37% are over the age of 50 years (17% on average).
You have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no a - levels and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities in the 2.3 million students with qualifications.
In the end, the very long - term unemployment widespread: 53% for the disabled to 38% in Gesamtschnitt.
In short, there are so many criteria that a renewed Arbeitseinstieg more difficult, and the “ heart of the problem lies, ” Christian Grapin, Director - General of Tremplin, a 1992 association set up companies to help disabled workers to recruit.
So much for the factual brakes.
The left unsaid, the mindsets, certainly, but slowly develop.
A in April from the Association of IMS - Entreprendre for the journal La Cité study of the managers surveyed have “ a weak Kenntnisniveau on disabled, ” the “ over - represented ” is “ for people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually off. ”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the Anstellungsziel of 6% disabled workers, which by law in 1987, has been established.
The latter, which dates back to 2008, figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
“ We are now in the 3%, ” said Pierre Blanc, Director - General of Agefiph, the organization that is entrusted to collect contributions from companies that this law.
The evidence: the number “ charges zahlender ” sites, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and although zahlenmäβig of 59.000 on 000 (and of 606 to 480 million euros).
“ The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, said Pierre Blanc. ”
“ But this improvement also brings a real recognition, especially at the groβen Firmengruppen. ”
According to the Ministry of work only 59% of the sites between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
Hazard: “ what a happiness ”
Even before the “ blue take place on Tuesday (20: 45 p. m.) to offer, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens their pleasure them the Freundschaftsspiel, not to hide.
It would be too wide - ranging to claim that this was a covert agreement between them, but the symbolic image speaks volumes.
Side by side on the Zuschauerpodium the Stade de France sits, George Leekens and Eden Hazard well peace can close down.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his Angriffsspielers against Turkey, the belgian soccer have nothing but praise on his person picked.
“ I am very pleased with his progress of Eden, and the fact that he is belgian. ”
“ I want to look to the future, ” assured the native Liller on his part.
What the contrast between his statement in the club and Nationalelf concerned “ it is an entity that justifies everything. ”
“ I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium. ”
“ It is time for me to start to go. ”
Hazard after Saint - Denis, brought on Friday against Romania on the Matchs against France, at last, “ to shine. ”
But without the note of the “ fun ”.
The french national team he fires since the age of 7 years, its victorious campaigns he between 1998 and 2000.
“ I was always supported, ” he confirmed.
This is bound to encourage the “ unique ” nature of this meeting yet.
So much in advance: “ Mathieu Debuchy () (), Yohan Cabaye and Adil Rami () will be present, ” he remembered.
“ We are just mentioned. ”

As in Zenica, the Portuguese, already at the beginning of maximum pressure on the Bosnians, “ they would not have time to think admit. ” ”
A good idea, provided that this time will be put into practice.
