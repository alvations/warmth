Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose pisten sorgenn make not only the riesengebirgen-anwohnern.
The lack of snow discourages people of appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It is therefore in riesengebirge still free room for all wintertermine incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited .
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to cultivate binding.
And if they call us to ask them immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or "Matsch" will be led by the operators of the information Spindl.Info portal, Martin Jandura.
Who the silvester-aufenthalt in the spindelmühle just after his ideas like that should no longer with the appointment hesitate.
Anyone who prefers the SAVE and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The spindelmühle-hotelbesitzer offer now for the silvestertag mostly only wochenaufenthalte.
I think that they are still, for a time, will seek to sell it, but then you also have to give in, and for shorter periods.
And then the free room quickly, jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold off.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free .
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas stays prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The silvestertag in riesengebirge can also offer the vrchlabi-reisebüro yet , but there is much less free seats .
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest will be sold Wintertermine on average.
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that in giant is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should be the Pisten within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a bit better than last year, manages the room in the hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year .
On Silvestertag and at Christmas, we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, the business will also run well, the director of the best Pec-hotels, Karel Rada informed.
To 80 per cent for the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel Omnia in zentralparkplatz in janske Lazne occupied.
Remains to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we are currently occupied at around 60 percent.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment, when the snow, is the interest in the placements in Giant, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Wait for a greater Schneebescherung the Riesengebirge-hotelbesitzer now.
On Thursday it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should be the snow on the mountains.
But then again, is a warming, informed Jiri jakubsky from the site of the Czech wetteramtes in Hradec kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comic, with what schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of repeatedly, even for the most stupid.
When he finally his sehnsüchtig erwartete afghanistan-doktrin ausschwitzte, it showed that he is this on the kopierpapier from the busch-irak-szenariovor abschrieb three years ago.
Not only is it in the text itself , the saying goes , " as in Iraq " , he has even the name of the Bush - declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration : " New Vorwärtsweg ' is used , without hesitation .
He has even three years of the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military lands that the only possible and insofar as a great success that it is now in the news about Iraq no longer.
Bush's reputation has not improved by objectively, because he has hintergelassen his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military it again, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten vacillating - trench in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President was reluctant three months, but with no better idea came, and he has the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000 deals, even if he originally forecast of at least 10,000.
Highly problematic for the Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine has left more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the cut increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the civil war of recent years is the irak-gesellschaft relatively well structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the kontraindikation - it can rely on no one , and there are no agreements .
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind.
The political institutions , even if they were established formally correct , that leaves only scheinbauten , behind which the patriarchal stammbeziehungen will make further out .
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan- and Iran-influences.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
We believe that the small soldiers in the warlike proclamations on the 'frühheimkehr', is a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the Datumssetzung for the Troop withdrawal pure Irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians and want their Constituents cannot explain how the security of Germany or Italy with the war in Hindukusch-gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem to be solved not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama is the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only palliative for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that he can use a different strategy, fallls Totalausfall would prove this.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no prämienboni more in cash
The chief executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs this year received no prämienboni more in cash.
This has announced the company to the sharp criticism of their lohnpraktiken.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern instead of the money receives equities, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the shares the managers in the case will be withdrawn if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so in accordance with the agency Reuters at the forefront of the effort, the prämieboni Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott, JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism , having for the first three quarters of this year , almost 17 billion dollars for Prämienboni set aside .
The total amount of bonuses bonuses during the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today, despite the measure likely exceed $20 billion.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of länders has become the hottest political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, the 25,000 pound exceed, unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year, women have won the Nobel prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five rekordfrauen have today in Stockholm in the hands deskönigs of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel Prizes in the fachkategorien and for literature.
In addition to the four women scientists was under the German writer of Romanian abkunft , herta Müller , including .

The price for chemistry, the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and -Funktion.
The last laureatin granted the Nobel Prize for economics, the American, Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of the wirtschaftsberichtes received.
The only fachkategorie, no woman in this year, received a Nobel Prize, was physics.
This prize today have the scientists Charles Kao for research in the glasfasern-bereich and George Smith, together with Willard boyl for the ccd-chip-erfindung, which is the basis of all digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical fernrohre.
Each of these winners, the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of the Geldpreises.
The totals in each category of ten million Swedish kronor.
If there are several winners in each category, the prize money will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel peace prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He has acknowledged in his speech the Kontrovere his appointment, because he is only the beginning of his journey, and also at the head of the country, the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of its policy, but he added that wars in certain situations for the Erkämpfen of world peace is necessary, even if the price is high.
Minister janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning, receives the finance minister Eduard Janota, on the left in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form, as this has been released by the Assembly on Wednesday, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the Friday meeting will be.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis in public finances.

In Parliament , but on Wednesday on the linkspartei-vorschläge voted to geldumwälzung and the money for the staatsbeamtengehälter , for the maintenance of social services and direktlöhne of farmers .
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
between the left party , on the one hand , and the government , Klaus and , on the other hand , is a severe domestic political dispute , the question marks on the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinetts , on whose design of the ODS and CSSD , the Green Party in the spring .
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures, the fish 'government in the autumn have been used, and the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, must not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only a strong government, which is still on a broader consensus of the political parties could build.
The ods-vorsitzende, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The Ods-stellvorsitzende, Petr Necas, the Ctk said that the concept of Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the Cssd, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described in the editorial similar words as "strong Aussprüche."
The cssd-chef , Jiri Paroubek , responded to the topolanek-worte that the etatdefizit horrifying is that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year , and the 200 billion kronor .
On Wednesday, CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood shows-film "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, Rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid-regierungssystem in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is, in his personal history of the American oscar-schauspieler, Morgan Freeman.
They said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the East Wood drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has become the slave owners, a fictional U.S. president, and also in "Evan Allmächtig ", but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischeStaatsmann for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time it is the name of a gedichtes of the English author William Ernest henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak, as he
The film recounts a true story, the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, leading to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically.
He believes that he can reach people through sport, so he decides, the Rugbyspieler, belong to the world of the outsiders.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years, in order to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play that role at this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him , Mandela to shake hands .
I noticed when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, it will, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominate.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, as he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I was in the Türklingel rang that he opened and the first thing I to François Pienaar in my life, said: ' In the film, I see a lot more from '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" received positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the filmrezensionen on the web-seiten rottentomatoes.com , has invictus 76 % positive assessments .
light secrets on Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile
On Norway was a special lichteffekt of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted that only yesterday near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But the launch was not successful and described the type "Bulava missile, which was supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the raketetest had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Bulava is usually not at all or were damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one writes about "Bulava" than a "missile, not a fee."
A missile, which is not flies, but
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third raketenstufe.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the firing from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that fliegendes object caused by an indeterminate mysterious light on nordwegen indeed the damaged "bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals, diesesmal challenged and claims that it is not clear from a failure.
The first two stages of the missile were not enough and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage damaged.
Even if no teststart without mistake was made, the leadership of the Ministry of only six of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost fünfzigprozentige success therefore fulfilled the generals with optimism and it will continue to be claimed that the " bulava " will fly without problems and even to ten hyperschall-atomsprengköpfe with a gesamtgewicht of Max . 1.15 tonnes .

Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockeyspielers will only a game.
I believe that Fetisov one of these, can raise the Morale of other players, players Nemcinov.
If fetisov back to the eisfläche comes after AP, he will be the oldest Russian professional eishockeyspiel.

Czech discovery : a substance , even in the more gestählten ´ HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses, which are resistant to drugs.
This fact, against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus-varianten not so much, as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients can the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life in length and the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
Their use, but of a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of virus-vermehrung also has the development. Resistentviren SG, against the no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences cr, of the vscht (chemisch-technologische University) Prague and of the university in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus-resistenz.
They have proven that the substances known as metalokarborane on the eiweißstoff act, which is responsible for the hiv-viruses.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links, the Virus-vermehrung in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the Resistenz-problem.
In its work , the scientists to new ´ improved ´ links , on the basis of the knowledge of the molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viren-eiweißstoff were prepared .
The metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from bor-, hydrogen technology and kohlenstoff-atomen and by a metall-atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and maintainable virus
Hiv-protease is eiweißstoff of the HIV virus , for the life cycle of the virus is essential .
Without the hiv-virus-spaltung caused by the hiv-protease would not infektionsvirenpartikel tyres.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, explaining the scientists in the press report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR was issued.
In the work in the Science paper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe all ranks of the compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then further changed systematically.
A little weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the hiv-protease wurdne tested in the mark , even against their steady ( resistant ) variants of HIV-infected patients have been won .
The impact of the metalokarborane in the usual enzym-variante is not as strong, as in the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effects on the resistentvarianten, against the use of drugs are often ineffective.
The unique impact mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV applied research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
It is supposedly time for the analysis.
The Deputy Ods-vorsitzende, Petr Necas, said that the concept of Beamtenkabinetts with the support of the Cssd, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
After necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to look at in Parliament to support the minority , when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit , or whether it be in order to remain in office through the parlamentlinken .
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas.
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with linkpartei-änderungsvorschlägen on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they have hidden increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic, with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of budgetprovisoriums frase not clear.
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard janota, on his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier registered.
He has indicated that he will remain in office.
Reason to do so is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent are fishermen for the continuing fight with the budget-defizit have necas , pursuant to the nominanten the Social Democrats ( CSSD ) , the changes in the budget enforced in the government had nothing to do with .
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament will continue to defizit-steigernde laws, for example, the sickness pay and pensions are or the dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were proved wrong not
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the whole government.
By the ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes , Topolanek in a Textmeldung from the United States .
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who subscribe to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decides in favour, on the fight against the defizit-höhe of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the linksmehrheit currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of citizens democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is now, I will, said of the Two-pronged Nominee for Defense Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the premier Members would explicitly ask the need for the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament, and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
Even when I took on the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, especially at division of Parliament and the destruction of everything would be positive, reacted Topolanek itself.
The new map of the CD (Czech railways) will be fewer trains travel for roughly the same fare.
The Czech railways closed or restricted from 13 December some less will be closing its schnell- and lokalzüge, other links are reinforced.
The whole verkehrsumfang from the gültigkeitstag of new roadmap compared with today at 2 % .
Most tariffs incl. Basic and kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.
Several verbindungsmöglichkeiten received in the capital , for example , the inhabitants of the ostrava-gebiets , the railways , for the features of the type pendolino .
The by express train will no longer after Bratislava (Pressburg).
less fast trains will also be on the Prague-Pisek, Budweis, in principle, be the direct links from Prague to Letohrad reduced.
The biggest reduction in the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove ( Königsgraz ) , a total of eight per cent , a rise in May against Prague and its surroundings .

The biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, at the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth verkehrsweg of the vorortverkehrsystems esko, whose opening thanks to the eisenbahnelektrifizierung from lysa nad labem after milovice is possible.
The fernlangstrecken in the capital will be in the zielstation Prague - Hauptbahnhof end.
The CD introduces more lines sc pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after sumperk / jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regionaleisenbahn: increase of 200 million
The Schnellzüge are appointed and paid by the ministry of transport , the railways to the so-called Liquiditätsverlusts in the next year , four billion kronor , as in this year . The Lokalzüge supply the districts , all in all , they have to pay for that in the next year , eight billion kronor , with the state three billion .
This year, the regionalzüge 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the lokalzüge and the schnellzüge has the railways a zehnjahresvertrag newly completed, until now the Treaty was only ever for a year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it is not on the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
It is only to changes in one-day netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable internetfahrscheinen eliska .
For passengers without the kundenkarte will the price CD net of 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price eliska will then depend on the gefahrenen pro-enlargement until now, he was for the trip between any bezirkstädten uniform and cost 160 kroner.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, radim jancura today, makes for libel complaint against three sozial-demokratische leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district Südmähren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen inteview in radiojournal.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions, but in the end the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three head to pick up and say that we are cherrypicking, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we expensive than the Czech railways, because we are the prices of the Czech railways would know, the last week.
So, we have no choice but to us.
Because of this defamation of society student agency , said jancura the radiojournal .
At the same time he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission .
Hasek, the collection of the complaint for further continuation of the medialshow of jancura it as free advertising for his company and for his own person.

The campaign has initiated jancura after the districts at the behest of the regionaleisenbahnverkehrs agreed with the Czech railways and for the task in a high level of about 150 billion kronor no contracts were put out to tender.
After vancura such behaviour is illegal and in contradiction with the requirements of the European Court of Justice .
Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a Member of the CSSD.

Vaccination against pneumokokken free and voluntary
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
However, already have votes that the pflicht-impfung would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokken culminate.
The arzneiinstitut already set the maximum price of vaccines that the insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also on the Impfungsverfahren .
New vaccination
vaccines free of charge for August-Kinder
From January children can be vaccinated against pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not yet received .
Anyone with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay weiterewiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first impfdosis must between 3 and 5 month of life of the child will be given.
Already last year, a quarter of the families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all flächenimpfungen of children around 500,000 per year.
The Pflicht-impfung was introduced with the so-called Janota-paket.
Pneumokokken mittelohrentzündung , but also cause serious infections including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung .
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the pflicht-impfung of children against pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination duty ?
At the same time, it is said that the vaccine could be in the future.
From January is paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
That would be better , for example , the head of the Bürgervereinigung nahlas , Rudolf Kalovsky .
His association , even in the long term for the pneumokokken-impfung .
The experts at the International Conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed, at least the.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health wants but the impfverfahren against pneumokokken not change.
In this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the Fachgesellschaft of practical Kinderärzten , Hana Cabrnochova , that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks .
If all children were vaccinated, then we could reflect on the reduction of Wiederholungsimpfungszahl "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80% of parents their infants against pneumokokken inoculated from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is Groundbreaking, is that this is the first Flächenimpfung paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so save it for further treatment, Erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is a concern of the practical kinderärzte , linked to the purchase of vaccines .
After the original plans should the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies and doctors in the same way they are received by the state, as well as other vaccines issued to you.
Some members fear, however, that the insurance so "the money from the Krankenversicherungherausführen could."
That is why the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors per month 40,000 kroner to invest, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says cabrnochova.
They and we still
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a bauverbot voted for minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John bowen, an American academics, a thorough and thoughtful report saying whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten can be integrated into European societies – and be integrated.
Some readers of this new book admiration for the work of the author: "why the French not scarves love" (originaltitel: "why the French don 't like headscarves') (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a dispute that the country has one and a half decades and workers and their effects are still exercise.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good , he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France , but what is really happening in the area .
He has months in mosques , schools and colleges , which is now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France , as it bowen calls " Islamic space ' .
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall marriage (or both)?
Should young Muslims on evolution and rights of homosexuals deal?
Can a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system, in order to get a mortgage?
It is these Seemingly Mundane Affairs, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists, the Bowen respondents, are usually at odds with their salafi-gegenstücken – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia – the now of a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He queries to what extent French political leaders (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really pluralism committed.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rauere treatment as Catholics , Protestants and Jews , which in turn their historic compromise with the secular republicanism had to make .
He sees more of a "tightening the werteschrauben" as a growing pragmatism.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say ' yes, but not yet. "

Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich sea, only with the rifle musket-shape fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true.

A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision.

Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.

The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban Government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legally in Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government officials $15 per month.

Pakistani government officials meet plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope the case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruitment agencies to identify the Internet after absuchen radicalised young men.
Investigators said that receiving-special opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan, after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.

But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, saifullah, the al-kaida-führer not convinced that the men are not part of a cia-verschwörung to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the North West, which has become a terroristenzufluchtsstätte.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not Discouraged and tried to obtain the right recommendations in order to get access to the Al-kaida-lagern, when they were arrested by the Pakistani Law-enforcement.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan are and will be questioned by the FBI unterstreicht - the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the us-geheimdienst to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The Gangmasters act as guardians of the organization, not those who let, whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits are from A Qaeda of a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to us-zielen and its propagandawertes you will but also as immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years has also become much more cautious in regard to whom to allow access, because the US intelligence experts are their recruitment methods.
If you try to Anyone in these groups, what better way could be to follow, as the Rekrutierungsmodell, so many have followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action"

Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event is relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zündete.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with transparent through the city, which was in English, "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birth of their mother, their awareness of what herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - to pass the floor and appeal to the world to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the games.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella-zentrum and said that they have arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either Hooded or Taschenmesser Mitführten.
According to Danish law, these actions in demonstrations were banned.

It shows the Concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.

Test data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, the records show that in the last two years, the fourth-and Achtkl�Ssler faster progress than cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what in the latest figures from the national evaluation of the bildungsfortschritts (national assessment of educational progress, naep) is included, is the stubborn leistungskluft between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of the White Viertkl�Ssler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 on 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the leistungskluft rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertkl�Ssler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 large-scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score, the children of both groups have grown in that time, the difference with 58 points now scarcely decreased.
Some bildungsbefürworter of distrikts last week expressed their concern that the results of schulkanzlerin Michelle A. rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. fenty were celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already high-achieving children were taken.
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D.C..
I springe not for a range of two or three points and knelt, said the democratic Washington stadtratsmitglied, Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of eaton-grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the Prüfungspunktzahlen is that the secondary schools in the city urgently need attention.
Of course we would like to see the positive signs, which I respect.
I fear, however, is that we do not spend the time and energy that we would have to commit to our mittelschule.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils.
This autumn , for example , will be some teachers trained a new Leselehrplan , Wilson-Lese-System to use , which is aimed at pupils in the upper classes in primary schools and Mittelschule , basic skills of reading , not at the beginning of their Schullaufbahn have mastered and significantly behind their peer groups .
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from nursery school until the sixth class games and lebensechte experience, was under the former chief schulinspektor clifford janey to Washington and the curriculum, some of the naep-fortschritte, the last week were reported.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils benefit below the central level, Rhee said.
Others say that the naep-ergebnisse highlight the question of whether rhee can continue to improve the performance of the system and will continue to play the extra money and resources for the leistungsschwachen schools can provide the necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the Urban Audit.
The conventional medicine is, its resources and management reforms at the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could cause political repercussions against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey now schulinspektor in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the leistungskluft is the traditional public school year in Washington, which currently 180 days, to extend to compete with the charter-schulen.
It must be the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey who, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.

The coach the gettysburg-college with a noisy home.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the ziegelsteinfassaden and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have the Highschool in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot in a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtkl�Ssler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, was a reverence full visitor, rather than the future of enthusiastic students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said food for thought, as the low professor-zu-studenten-verhältnis school reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh, the children on their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message included in full: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School end or as a teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, which received the college training that is in the middle class.
In truth , is one of five of this " second generation " of the college - which is a remarkable achievement , given that many of their parents , mostly from Mexico or Central America , the United States , without the highschool concluded .
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the workforce of the country, show the way forward.
Those who high-achieving children, say, these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success.
Many of them have also parents who give their children high goals and find ways to their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But beratungsprogramme also play a major role by graciela and millions of children as they help in college, especially if these efforts for long periods of time fortbestehen.
If you look at Low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche by the system, a single measure at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, the Hispanoamerikanische students.
We have to think about it, for these children a network of pre-school and supported by the highschool.
The bundesprogramm, the gracielas college-tour had funded, is a useful example.
It is known as gear up - get a hochschalten - and is more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems are available to begin to launch college-vorbereitungsprogramme, when low-income pupils in the mittelschule are and continuing until you have completed the highschool.
According to the US Department of Education has helped the programme since 1999, more than 10 million students, of which more than 60% in college.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies from
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government in two on Saturday completed auctions major oil companies can get his damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.

Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for non-auctioned fields in June.
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American valued in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European the path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the US military held American oil companies from likely, analysts said to do more in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, significantly lower wage costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the contracts with the Ministry managed to complete.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, with the Iraqi oil ministry and close relations in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has for more contracts, than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the great of the global economy, as well as a technologiemacht.
We are convinced that the chinese companies with its mitbietern measure can and will meet its commitments to iraq.
For the Gebotsabgabe vorausgewählte companies gave commandments , which , with the fee per barrel of oil compared to the ministry was willing to pay to reduce the emission of each of the current level .
Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious us-raketenangriff along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan , this week a top-einsatzplaner Al Qaeda have been killed , representatives of the us-terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday .
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh Al-somali was one of the two Arabs, according to Us-quellen and Pakistani Behördenvertretern region of a number of missiles should be killed on Tuesday their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province Nord-waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said authorities of a Pakistani civilian intelligence from Miran Shah by telephone.
locals, who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the point and took everything quickly, which completely destroyed by the "bodies" was left.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the Us-terrorismusbekämpfung Indefinitely evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies , throughout the world , said a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous , and the sensitive nature of the American air strikes on its soil .
If his central role as given, this included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He brought strategic instructions from the topführern of Al Qaeda and did in operationsplanungen for possible terrorist attacks .
The second American authorities said that Somali quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy friend-Belarus and best compounds used to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second authorities, but this reduces the risk that he is not for us and our allies.
If confirmed, his death would be claimed the second leading Al kaida- or talibanführer since September, was killed in a similar attack najmuddin jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the stammesgebiet and three other topaktivisten were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of a nonprofit website, outrageously, by an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time on suspected informants who brutally killed, according to the side.

He said that he wanted the notification of UN

The un-regeln are designed in such a way that I since May, he said, only one person could.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must Reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he was not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the Kriegsgebiete in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 soldiers in northern Iraq and the Prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"one of the things on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war's own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama prefers a package of sanctions in recital on the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could affect the Durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people tremendously" suffering from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the spokesman for the White House, Robert gibbs, the American Government, the European leaders in warning that the Iran with "credible" consequences if he must reckon with its nuclear programme is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its atom-überwachungsorganisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and an essential part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for a medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, however, since this time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to commit to the United States.
Iran the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, are simply that, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as it brought in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran have never been, said gates.
President Obama has 31 dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals, before he had other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions", will continue.
In a statement in New York , Iran's representation at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what they " baseless allegations " and some members of the Security Council on the Iranian Atomaktivitäten called and said that they are ready to resume talks with the United States and five other world powers to continue , " in order to provide a long-term solution . "
Gates, the last Friday to return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he joined the Oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish Behördenvertretern in Irbil.
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays of US plans, the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. Us-vertreter quoted gates of masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will their security, prosperity and their autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda hoardings lecture on which they felt that "mother earth is too tired to have more children," and "a baby more means a grave."
These lessons they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no case."
We already have all of our time and energy in a child .
For a second child is nothing more, said Wang, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously Dicklichen spoiled Einzelkindern Affectionately called "little Emperor", has Produced, a Bevölkerungskrise in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN is.
Department for population, while the number of the population 60 years and older in the year 2020 of 16.7% of the population by the year 2050 31,1% rise Exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year have 60-jährige and older almost 22 percent of reported residents identified Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai stadtbevölkerungs- and familienplanungskomission has said that couples should receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to help "the proportion of the ageing bevölkerungsanteile and the labor to mitigate the future".
Shanghai will soon be "old -- but not so rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples now against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese staatsvertreter have attributed to this policy, that the critical financial pressure on the natural landesressourcen could be avoided, whereas human rights abuses in the enforcement of the policy have condemned.
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to Abzutreiben.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive abortions, and take an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one-child policy weakened.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers and members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was moderated by the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a Einzelkind partner.
Shanghai in july was the first chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
posters, the families Belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how we can apply for approval.
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning, in order to couples at home and durchzuschieben sheets under the doors.
You also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, the more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said familienplanungsvertreter.
disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications of couples to recognise is that after the start of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts against this report.
In the municipality huinan with a population of 115 000 are still per month, for example, only four or five requests.
Disheartened Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city , despite the campaign is still around 165.000 -- will be slightly higher than 2009 , but lower than 2008 .
Feng juying, head of the familienplanungskomitees the Shanghai Community caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang jiawei , 27 , and his wife , Liu juanjuan , 26 , said that they would like to have two children , and this is also legally permitted .
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one-child policy as the human rights issue , said Yang , an engineer , his wife in the seventh month is pregnant with their first child .
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said that they would only a child, because it was a einzelkind. "we were at the centre of the family and used that each of us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-jähriger, a Übersetzungsunternehmen said it Plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese Kapitalismusexperiments fight and they want to see such a life not for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the raumfrage -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life -- "If the child 9 months old, is already a CV for the best nurseries have finalize."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first , which has achieved a higher standard of living , he said .
We do not want too many victims.
Uno-gruppe sketches plan to reduce emissions
The by the United Nations-sponsored conference on climate change -- until now by wild posturing and mutual accusations had -- on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, the industrialised nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden.
The text , which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could , has both the remaining obstacles , as well as to the way forward .
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text , which was created by a special UN working group has been formulated , is silent on the money supply , the rich countries to poor countries should be in the short and long term , so that they can deal with the global warming .
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrial and big emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great flexibility , so John Coequyt , a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington .
Michael Zammit cutajar, of the six pages document, has drafted a 180 pages long verhandlungstext, so the focus on what the leading klimaschutzvertreter the UN, yvo, Mr de Boer, as "the big picture.
It shows the footprint of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25% to 45%, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30% would reduce.
Together , the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 % .
The European community has the talks on Friday a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from maestros of floods and droughts by avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, yet the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week had intended.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is a tougher line with China , as a representative of the Bush administration , not more than two years ago .
The United States will sign an agreement, without any significant emerging stand up and take action, so Stern, also Lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he Yafei, stating that the leading U.S. climate negotiator either to "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week, that the United States, China, to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fissures.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers, who bear the costs for the slowing down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have moved, aggressive, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic domination, ulate, also as a regional klimawandelberater for conservation international in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning presented a 24 page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, "exerting political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions before the arrival of the government leaders must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives , such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vizeminister entstiegen their aircraft and through the corridors of the Bella-Centers to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences , claims , during the course of the next week .
The sheer scale of the assembly -- more than 13,000 people daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold night shows, where they make a joke about the countries, which they feel betrayed and sell, and contract drafts from hand to hand rather than e-mail -- is already passed a challenge.
The intensity is just: almost all of the important ministers are now here and on Wednesday will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.

Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defines the montagsgefühl new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will be a pipe permeate the darkness to announce a zugabfahrt a revolution in transport in the United Kingdom .
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country, with its blitzfahrt of ashfort, Kent, London St pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes to go.
To Lord adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first javelin-pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain , to an international network of faster , more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands , the North and Scotland to London .
The neglected province to living pendlerstädten could arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would be radically reduced and the change of plane and car to railways would the national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billions of British pound, which for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about could damage in the British hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen still applying the brakes.
High speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed streckenkarte the next planned stage of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new railway line , the London with the West Midlands , with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places vorbeiführen , where the effects on the environment are controversial .
In the free site, the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
Hs2 should also three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network.
Lord adonis will respond in the spring .
The preferred option proposed is a y-förmige route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would be in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland , and another in the direction of the north-east after Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne .
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a eisenbahn-insider.
After the completion of the travel time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the trains with a speed of 400 km / h, thereby the British rail network would be the quickest way of Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to be able to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the line london-birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be necessary, on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be it.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord adonis will be known whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would be the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgage for a Conservative to pfund-orangerie 75,000
Alan Duncan , the leading unterhausmitglied the Conservatives , the taxpayer per year thousands of pounds for the cost of in Orangerie in his house in his constituency are deported .

It was the taxpayers the additional zinsaufkommen to take into account, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons the applications were approved at the time and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, of carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible, ".
Duncan, one of the richest unterhausmitglieder, has a zweistöckiges House in a village in his constituency of Rutland and melton.
In the nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and esszimmer, but the fees office, a ausgabenkontrollstelle of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan more space needs.
Last year, he has grown a Wintergarten in the plans as "Orangerie '.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also during a recent inquiry into its previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on standards and privileges not called for increased borrowing.
The committee has him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules.

"Essentially means, if it works for the state that one must live by meagre rations and how S * * * * * e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and entitled to a tiny part of what is measured.
And I would call for the whole damn sum , but I do not do it . "
The parliament member, millionaire from his former career as a �Lgrossh�Ndler, was attacked because of his spending in May for the first time, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had checked with the fees office that this "could be seen as excessive demand".
As a protest has an activist in duncans rasen a hole in the form of a pfundzeichens , after it became known that he has three years ( £ 4 500 euro ) had demanded .
Last night, when he was asked about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both by the fees office, as well as following has been approved by Legg to value increase."
He added: "There is no debate about branching out and Durchschlängeln or a Verbiegen the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clean and clear. "

Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples,"  "regularly" before the chamber board and "anything but commendable."

The parties alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, to use their Siegel
The alliance, the party of Fran�ois Bayrou ' s party Modem will be monitored, on Friday on a takeover attempt of the label, once the party founded by Val�ry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the party nouveau centre, Herv� Morin, reacted angrily and under threat of prosecution, asked him to use this document labeling in any more.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend after he would have done the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose parteipartner the UMP is, in fact, wanted to this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), a claim to the property of the trademark UDF, since he was the first this brand 2004 'national institute de la propriété industrial "has asked for.
However, the geschäftstelle of François Bayrou's friends supervised parteienbündnisses UDF silence and clearly gave us to understand that they were not expropriate, the ministers and the Members under threat of prosecution a deadline, not to use this seals and the property rights of the trademark.
You have in the last few days , a number of statements that they have their political movement would propose that UDF-Siegelzu + + , wrote the Frente in a , 19 of the 24 Büromitglieder signed the letter , including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez , the party modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance .
They also believed to be possible you would have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this label, said the rules instead of the UDF and calls for the party in NC, "without the mention of the name of S�Mtlichem UDF material and (their) website to remove".
Also, one of hervé de charette, "the property rights of the an to transfer their legal anspruchsberechtigen."
If they refuse, we will take action against them, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In her letter to stress that "UDF" since 1978 and a fully-fledged political movement is a reminder that Morin and his friends "choice" to leave this 2007, in order to create a competing movement, as others have done in 2002, the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau Centre has, therefore, the undersigned, no rights, the udf-siegel (Union pour la démocratie Française).
They continue to remind you that the last congress of the UDF 2007 three-year entry into the party modem and the creation of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat, "he was at the time, as he has requested the brand name, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited on Scandalous and Fraudulent Manner, from the absence of the Deposit of Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves.
Still give you to bear in mind that this recklessness is poised to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us, but in politics as in life would be better to make a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by fraudulently acquired a name on it has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned because of exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday, the artist François-marie Banier to assess to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt claims, a weak moment of 80 has being Cheated, a part of their assets.

In fact, this decision means that it will be a process in this Affair, the saga is one of the richest families of France, in the mother and daughter Scrap and at the same time the reins of Kosmetikimperiums L'Oréal.
Equally , however , the 15 Court ordered a medical examination of the 87-jährigen liliane bettencourt , which will be carried out jointly by three doctors .
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.
On Friday appointed doctors before 10 March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane beds Court could have found in a state of weakness.
I think that they will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
What the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news ( ... ) . The report will show that he ( Banier ) this old lady manipulated , which must be protected , he said .

Liliane bettencourt refuted , for its part , has always been manipulated by the photographers to it as a long-standing friend .
Although the Court the admissibility of Mrs bettencourt-meyers should examine the complaint, the plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday to a large familiendebakel.

Liliane bettencourt "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf , " the representative of the public prosecutor's office , Marie-Christine Daubigney .
The Court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the process to the admissibility of Mme bettencourt-meyers has taken place.
Manager-revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its staff, said the position of companies vis � vis consumers before the marketing-revolution: it is certainly the best to join the staff of "values", as it was earlier in the consumer-products of the technicians in work designed to impose.
The customers at the heart of the company has the Marketing-Revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the on the ground ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again !
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & eund, even more importantly, to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact urges the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; they claimed by the staff employed, which the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a revolution that it would be the staff in denmittelpunkt the concerns of the company equal to the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
Are the internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange his, has made this revolution in terms of the management-praxis suggest?
I fear that, unfortunately not.
- First, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many detours, finally, to do... What it has always done.
Also because of the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a much simpler idea of human behaviour.
emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. American "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, an aktuellein Le figaro. Fr survey of Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The Mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measure
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental record: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
At the moment only take the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it allows them to achieve their life goals offers.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these Mobilisierungsfaktoren can the executives of the companies for their " social " , and to anticipate and human resource management back to the right place .
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence is favourable .
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right a
On Friday, the American right by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo crafted speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the president, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs have raised.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush inherited, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, trying to justify the use of force; a way his entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work".
I thought that the speech was really very good, frohlockte the former President of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's.
In some parts of habeich this speech altogether ginrich perceived as historic, said in the radio programme "the takeaway" has been questioned.
The Member of Parliament by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased with a "president of the left" to have seen the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and not passing on a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist."
For Michael Gerson , a former Schreiber of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post , Obama has " a very American speech " .
In addition to the fact that he is "cosmopolitan", as he always does, "he said," as an American President, "as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they themselves have created for their protection and do a lot, "Gerson.
Of the few, not convinced rights called the former Uno-botschafter John Bolton, a Hawk the Bush era, the speech on the Website of the National Review Online as "Boring, Pompous and Inspirationslos".
To the left of the president is the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama resorting to the armed forces.
Verpackt the war under the guise of Justice, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praise on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker as him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental ".
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse," and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary" at the same time.

The activists are now, not to block the Depots.
"There will probably always be some recalcitrant, are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.

The Turkish constitutional court on Friday was the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country, and in Istanbul.

The decision followed a in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya proceedings. he accused the DTP, which "command" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.
The party is assured, "no link" to the PKK, but refuses to describe this as a terrorist organisation, and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the constitutional court transmits the government, which is seeking to accommodate the Kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, support for the PKK, the Kurds are drying up and an end to the conflict.
The leader of the DTP confirm that a solution to a resurgence of tension in südost-anatolien, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which the pkk-chefs Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks clashes with the police.

"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, Anm. that editorial) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision.
" We oppose in principle against the closure of the parties .
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a Frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political Marktbeobachter Ahmet Island.
"It is obviously on a response to the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK to an attack, in which three days earlier killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey. It was one of the most brutal attacks over the past few months.
New silicon-valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the town hall with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow vize-bürgermeister Yuri rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of selenograd led the Russian delegation that in Frankfurt, planungsdezernent Edwin black.
2010 will be representatives of the fiz and small and medium-sized enterprises in the science foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after selenograd travel.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be on the growing Russian market.
Conversely want Russian wissenschaftsfirmen contracts in Germany .
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
For example , these include the Moscow Institute for Elektronentechnik , large corporations and Rosssijskaja Elektronika .
The municipality in 1958, was a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
for the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
right. S21 is much more than the deeper set of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in chaos ludicrously construction site.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
With lines , right in the middle of the city , was seen at the time as a verkehrstechnische fossils of the 19th century , as a modern rail transport , as it was once a huge amount of time , locomotives from behind forward umzuspannen .
There , in short , to travel further - so what .
And that is why the kopfbahnhöfe disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof the rules half-way through the trans-European schienen-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city is almost priceless to implement the tieferlegen.
However , kopfbahnhöfe have no one and ausfahrtsproblem more , since it modern wendezüge with locomotives and steuerwagen at both ends .
Still, Stuttgart 21 and the ice-neubaustrecke after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have it.
Power with the railways, partly because the risks of the largest infrastruktur-einzelprojekts the Republic of taxpayers and not the staatskonzern.
The project is still reasonably justified .
There is new stadtraum, is the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is s21 harmful.
The durchgangsbahnhof and the streckenausbau are intended for the transport of persons, to which one typical 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the neubaustrecke because of intense steigungen is not for freight trains.
Even more serious is that s21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.
One of the most important is the development of good 180 kilometres long journey through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion.
So desperately needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The rheintalstrecke will be the real bottleneck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.

Mr Posch, the accusation of schäfer-gümbel falling, the provincial government attempts, with "rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" still to come to their night flights.
A precise legal examination need their time.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as the opposition, are the statements of his group have never been on night flights.

With the argument that under Brender had the news of the ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept a further term of the highly-regarded chefredakteurs.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Finally, 35 Staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the Koch entered as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on 4 August 1957.
He studied politics, education and Romanistik.
Later, he worked in the südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
The ZDF Frey changed in 1983, firstly on the "heute-journal".
Subsequent phases: in 1988 to 1990 personal spoke of the chefredakteurs; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and host of "morgenmagazins"; by 2001, head of the zdf-außenpolitik head of zdf-hauptstadtstudios; since then.
The Greens after the dismissal Brenders, announced on Wednesday by the journal medium magazine was elected to the journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint.
The board of directors , the Prime Minister , Kurt Beck , said last week that the countries should change so that Personalvorschläge of Intendanten not by a politically motivated majority be blocked .
A withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, but also Beck.
Brenders Voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board with a Bold move - it hard for the body immediately after the Brender-abwahl criticised.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence it both schächter without loss of face for the post of chefredakteurs nominate and the management board without the suspicion, a party office.
In the parteiarithmetik Frey will, in any case, the liberal left-wing.
Studies will Entrümpelt
Partial success for the students : after a year of bildungsstreiks drew the culture ministers of the countries on Thursday at long last , at a meeting of kultusminister- and hochschulrektorenkonferenz both sides agreed to in the studienbedingungen bachelor and master attempt to improve .
The students should be able to handle their studies.
In particular, it is to reduce the prüfungsbelastungen: in principle, each studienmodul only with a single audit.
In addition to the workload of the students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level".
Politics and universities also want the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries arrangements, it should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June uni-rektoren culture ministers and bear the saying of the better studierbarkeit in the mouth .
Now it was for the first time with a specific content .
The so-called Akkreditierungsrat decided to reduce the number of audits partially dramatically: "each module includes usually with only one test," it says in a 30-page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part.
With the 'significant reduction in prüfungslast', said the akkreditierungsrat-vorsitzende Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the studierbarkeit significantly impaired."
In addition to the "Studierbarkeit" in the future, "the decisive criterion" in shaping.
Modules as content are " strictly checking " whether " unnecessary einengungen of students in the choice of
events "would be avoided.
The students' claim that margins, the own initiative and promote '.
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "– which means that it will take until 2015, until all courses were reviewed.
responsible for this are bundesweit ten Akkreditierungsagenturen , which was set up by the countries .
The Culture Minister had the countries in October "vigorously" for the agencies to make sure that the stofffülle the prüfungsregime not too big and not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and colleges with the Landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
A single country said this Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds.
Of the money is to set up tutorenprogramme above all the universities and studienberatung and audit and auslandsämter strengths .
Country and universities want to spend for ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants an amendment of the hochschulgesetzes into Parliament.
This is for the conclusion of a study model only one examination be necessary.
The study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of performance is expected to prove to other universities and the easier access to the master.
By the end of next year all the courses of the country on their Studierbarkeit be reviewed.
Government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Bundesvorstand the Juso-Hochschulgruppen called for the design of the education policy should in future no longer be " behind closed doors " of ministers and Hochschulrektoren .
at the latest after the Bildungsstreiks should now also the students affected " to have a say . "
The future graduates received support from the President of the hochschulrektorenkonferenz (hrk), Margaret wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday in a meeting with the culture with which the hrk on a common reform paper was discussed.
The trade union education and science (gew), the Bonn process as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal entitlement, of any graduates with a bachelor-abschluss access to a secondary masters course.
On the other hand , the countries must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor-studierenden tomorrow with the best possible studienbedingungen sufficient masterstudienplätze available , so gew-vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar .
The countries must be much more teachers .
To a freer access to the master, were the Culture Minister, however.
More than a footnote to herta Müller
In Germany and go out is almost no control... "is the anfangszeile of a gedichts of lyrikers Werner söllner in which this in troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of dissidents, of the freedom won, but at the same time his language has lost.
The 1951 Romanian-born Banat Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor worked in a children's book publishing house before he moved in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner is with various literaturpreisen been excelled in 1993, kept the legendary Frankfurt poetikvorlesungen in the goethe-universität, and since 2002, he is head of the hessischen literaturforums in mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major außerliterarisches high-profile, he last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, with the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and zerrspiegel their securitateakten".
Visibly shaken and move Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as internal for the Romanian Securitate.
Together with some of those present had Söllner 1989 the German Sprachpreis .
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "anyone who is against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist, Werner söllner is in the Walter.
Almost at the same time, with the nobelpreisehrung for herta Müller and unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literaturszene and, in particular, the Community of from Romania's German authors by a case that the reasons and the cowardice of a political system, which is adapted to monitoring and spying is based.
Werner Söllner is, so far after bisherigem knowledge can say, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate-akte have played a role in Walter, said after the confession söllners the literaturwissenschaftler Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had swindled him in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany is a cosy preserve for securitate-spitzel had already been herta Müller in July at the time, having their own acts, 914 sides, reading.
The people concerned, we should be suspect, speculation and in some cases also have known what klarname behind the aliases sorin, voicu and also verbarg Walter.
Unlike the intensified now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of stasi-akten is dealing with the legacy of the securitate-überwachung still very vague.
A systematic information is thwarted in recent years and has been hampered.
One of the birthler-behörde equivalent National Council for processing the securitate-akten (cnsas) was set up until 1999, the publication of the files, however, since then proceeded more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that the administration of the files.
The influence of former securitate-mitglieder in Romania is still very great, came after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for herta Müller an interview in which a previous securitate-chef from temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, finally, they have only once interrogated.
The scandal of the power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case söllner link , as so often in connection with verschwiegener fault , unavoidable questions .
Why only now? who was hurt? the Measured response of listen to Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of Wissensdrang rather than determined by Apportioning Blame and shame.
To genese of herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if there is a smart Gekleideter Aussendienstler of a very happy Christmas to a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian gross in the company of an orange plastic bag Ausr�Sters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a finding on C-class rose.
The man with the markanten Glatze was because of him in a foreign city .
Otherwise he would have been able to drive themselves, alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55-Jährig any more.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work on.
Or will not get.
In the words of the only three days earlier schweizers pledged: "We have reached the 8", in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1-erfolgs against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but let us not be fooled by the success: It was a brutally hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then, in Mainz the königsklassen-leistung in liga-alltag again.
And once again revealed weaknesses in the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lots
The final 8 of the Champions League ( Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March ) will be on 18 December in Nyon .
The joy on the commencement of the Babbel-Nachfolgers remained so .
Not only the supposed saviours of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and spielfreude gives.
I am on the players and told them that they should consider its strengths, and have, said to be brave souls plumber Gross in these simple recipe for success, under Therapeut Babbel but had ceased to have any effect.
It has a certain magic, was Babbel-befürworter Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which they would not have thought possible."
And Sami khedira, after a verletzungspause thanks to his dynamism go straight to the best players on the place in the attempted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "wind of change" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it obviously lacking.
The vfb Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods , warns sportvorstand Horst heldt
The vfb Stuttgart needs but, above all, consistent.
As gross herding , players and managers , the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and totally überforderte defenses of the Romanian guests .
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 will wake up, Khedira.
And sportvorstand Horst heldt warned that a saisonziel been achieved, the other is still far off.
We are not yet out of the woods.
That heldt in his 40th birthday even after the first heimsieg since three months after much like celebrating was not to do with the events of the weekend in the form of a just before spielbeginn fernseh-interviews broadcast by torhüter Jens lehmann fresh auflebten.
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
The had accused the board of directors and the proven führungsschwäche trainerwechsel have decided to pressure pubertierender fans.
Even his free day after games had been withdrawn, wertete Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmanns statements are "of pure egotism," keilte Heldt, vowing consequences for the schlussmann.
They are no friends for life, the two forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that, without the preparatory work by the abgelöste trainerteam the games and combative strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had " a large share of the success , " said Heldt and Lehmann - and the man with the Plastiktüte agreed .
In the heavyweight
They hitziges in Bern: continually provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy weight-title after version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-jährige champion after version of the Association WBC defeated in the night on Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson, unanimously after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For klitschko, it was the third successful titelverteidigung after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it has with the k.o., all expected to have not worked.

Johnson's challengers had to fight the first defeat in 24 .
around 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena 2.02 metres great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, before the end of the klitschko-ära bated breath, either but always the blows of the OECD, so that klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial objective.
A total of passive Johnson too little for a challenger and sought only on the rounds.
Although he provoked klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo hoffmann in the year 2000, with klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds.
The Challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie", the "nothing right".

Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information on the kunduz-affäre described as a liar.
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - the latest information on the bombing of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister to Karl-Theodor Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanklastzüge of September "knowingly the untruth" said grünen-fraktionschef Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday in the ard-nachrichtensendung "Tagesschau".
It is called the landläufig: he lied.
The order for the killing was in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only to a destruction of the abducted Vices, but also two Talibanführer targeted killing.
In the German kunduz-kommandeur Colonel small us-luftangriff were requested, according to nato-untersuchungsbericht up to 142 people have been killed or injured.
The SPD, Greens and Left on Saturday called for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the afghanistan-politik the federal government - and whether Chancellery, armed forces and intelligence service have approved of this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin, and grünen-kollegin Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not on concrete operations of the Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of generalinspekteur Wolfgang schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter wichert.
According to the Mirror, the two Guttenberg Correctly and fully informed about the Background of the Tanklaster-anschlags.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the nato-berichte and the Minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Department of Defense even on several reports have pointed out, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel small and a feldjägerbericht.
Wichert is now in a letter asked for clarification of the facts, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine General Sunday.
He had not yet received a reply, it says.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that will be in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which formed next Wednesday.
Traumwelten
Some see in wachem state images and hear voices , the others do not see or hear .
Not only in mental health and the drogenrausch blurring the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should Unbound the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden indulge in.
Who, in the wachsein traumartige conditions saw things, and does, the other not see or hear that, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drogensüchtig, at least as sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, cow and reality.
Traumartig modified Wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if cause and effect may distinguish the vision of the mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drogenerlebnisse of the new-age-propheten Carlos Castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but on similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - Dopamin, noradrenaline, serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic climate.
The Gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle term hallucinations as a form of dreams in discarding state, Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, noted 1861 a "very reminiscent of the irreseins with traumzuständen" for Sigmund Freud was the dream is "a climate, with all the inconsistencies, wahnbildungen, sinnestäuschungen such a".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comicfigur.
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him geflügelte teufelsgestalten with blutroten, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
You are hunting him him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the votes to attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet to a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and establishes the noose around the neck.
.
The noose does.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "Walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today , Henning T. 40 years old , he has seen six acute psychoses , the last is 2 years ago , the first almost 20 years .
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide climate, it is also manisch-depressiv, he takes medicines, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, for three years, he is married.
In the climate of I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population illness at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia , in psychiatric hospitals , such a second most disease after the depression .
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, they get trapped in a übererregten state of hallucinations, scale, relationships or paranoia can lead.
This is particularly widespread Stimmenhören - vote , comment on , or dialogisieren .
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The patient is not important to separate more trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disruptive signals, the consciousness of impressions flooded.
As the dream opens the climate of the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes bracket.
The realitätswahrnehmung in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, oberarzt the clinic for general psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the event, everything has a meaning to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, like the dream of the events overwhelmed and it may not actively shape.
schizophrenic feel so often threatened , controlled and manipulated .
A Realitätsabgleich is usually not possible, the Mere empty are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a lifetime to have seen a halluzination
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in the reality of the verfremdung of erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains antics proposes, researchers are still a mystery.
Ausnahmezustände in every person can lead to the reality in the short term, says Fox.
But not everyone will develop a climate.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturing of the brain in an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained Fox.
But there remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system comes first, and not Manifestiere over many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis if the disposition .
Halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychoses , as they are in the transmittersystem intervention .
If our brain is overheating
The crazy, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money on drugs, in order to get what, says the lübecker psychologieprofessor Erich castes.
Whether fantasies as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Castes assembles for ten years reports of hallucinations and trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his findings in the book "The unreal world in our heads."
Hallucinations belong to the typical effects of psychoses, but also of many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content, which would normally be held back.
They are, if areas, in which sensory processing, are actively discouraged or too little; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation lacking.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But it is also reizentzug , stress , liebeskummer or other mental ausnahmezustände .
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in a lifetime, to have seen a halluzination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-western Pomerania and visited the school.
A normal girl, really.
If it not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a Schlaksiger young with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he says the classmates look surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah k. not dreaming, it knows it.
It is awake, you can see or hear these boys, just as they have the girls in the bank and alongside.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But they know that this boy and the other fantasies is not real, and then disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening
The deceit images are often also a burden.
If you are sitting in the klassenraum , it can sometimes unterrichtsstoff not consequences , because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new mitschüler , while he presents for all other radio and visible in the bar of mathematical equations explained .
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
If they are following in their dark room to sleep is far too little and too late, it can often not distinguish whether you are awake or already is whether the images they see the fratzen or the girl with the bleeding schnittwunden of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in a calm, the characters cry.
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy.
Autumn 2009 . Sarah K. is now 20 years old .
It has in the past year , the baccalaureate and lives with her friend .
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes , she will know that they are not crazy .
obsession is also a work of art from Despair
If someone is socially isolated or under reizentzug he has, in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, as a little girl fear of other children, often, she played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man known as Papa, since they can think of is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah k. difficult to distinguish related images and reality-China. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute climate.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their fantasy images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between dream and halluzination
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world will see the imaginary , alas , pathologisiert , says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard , professor in Heidelberg and the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf .
A climate is a terrible, tragic disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-degenhard, the so-called oneiroide erlebnisform researched, a special form of traumartig modified wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the Erlebende for real, and it cannot distinguish the wakefulness in retrospect.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand is emerging in trauma- or krankheitsbedingten extreme situations, for example in polyradikulitis-patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a man of self- and weltverlust is under threat, for example by continuing, complete impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality by their own imaginary world, the reality is, says schmidt-degenhard detached.
A kind of grenzzustand between dream and halluzination.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a weltwechsel, but the reality is, in the imagination.
An intensive form of sinnstiftung and meaning in a precarious situation, the US gestaltungsfähigkeit own people, not in a nothing of the bewusstseinsverlustes sink.
Everything is real , later in the memory
Also the Z�rcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his conscience after a herzklappenoperation, followed by a herztransplantation posted on travel, while his body in critical care to maintaining.
Claussen in a selbstgeschaffene world, a visiting alien times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a zugsanatoriums, a robot watchdog on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, the drugs under nobles from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
Quite the contrary, I have the memories from mental travel even after years and in minor details unambiguous.
More and more even than really Erlebtes.
The intensity of this goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experience , says the psychiatrist .
At the end of the show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and Drogenrausch how fragile our internal given the external reality in the guards.
Any change in the bewusstseinszustandes, summed the psychologist castes, "can lead to a verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enriching .
The schneeeinbruch can come

My strategy was never the case.
He had "never weltmachtträume wird", so burda.

The promises of fonpeek
Äuβerst peek is limited , a device , which can only be read his e-mails , without an opportunity to be able to see certain annexes or be able to surf the Internet .
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is on the Straβe to see is unlikely, but the idea in itself, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that there were two new products on the market: One that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong Gratisservice for data, unlike the Peek, in which a six times higher price to pay.
Fonpeek yesterday in the event Le web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise of Europe.
The monthly Unterhaltspreis for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who , with a smartphone travel around the world , already know what it means to give up all the data in order to be able to read his emails , as soon as they cross the border , or if you are desperate for a café with WiFi addiction ( or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon ) .
The idea of the roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers have separate treaties and prices for abroad, but in my experience, it is already a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, in order to be able to read the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails, and rightly so.
That a small device such as FonPeek (and it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / WLAN) this type of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly, but surely rethink and start to of options to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is a Internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, namely the purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I expect of fonpeek one day, a kaufmöglichkeit with lifelong Internet access as the peek already in the US.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to have a computer with the same system to be able to see.
The fetischfarbe of Michelle
Gelb is without doubt the lieblingsfarbe of the American First Lady.
The arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States, in a dress and a mantle of the colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life to accompany: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on both occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a leading grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and the same substance, and it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States on the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made.
At the inauguration was a dress from head and one from Gemusterten office in Oslo.
The accessories were different : the first time Green shoes with halbhohen sections and the second time a änhliches model , but goldfarben .
Also's hair was different: the hair were put on this occasion as hair wreath tough, with the previous bore the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This result is the of csic in cooperation with the Institute for women study " fertility and career of women in Spain ' .
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career are in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study is open, that there is very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work.
Those of you who auβerhalb of the House do no other work only part-time work or a fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a permanent jobs, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a strong employment bear their first child on average only 3.7 years after the Zusammenziehen, a number which increased to 4.1 years for women by employment, which took longer to achieve this and Zusammenziehen and have the first child until much later.
Auβerdem has the kind of work a Groβen influence on motherhood, Albeit less than the calendar in Empfängnisbereitschaft, "says the Csic-forscherin Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
There is also still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss before your first get married and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way round and seek out only a permanent employment and marry later and then get their first child, Delgado.

Here, he used a predictable and furchteinflöβendes genre (kurzbiografie, live and work), but is looking for a änhlichkeit the fervent heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither of Horror Erleuchtungen.
Auβer that this book is a köstlicher lesegenuss , it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again .
Here are a few ausschnitte from the book.

On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what it is in the blood, not in his mind, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the messerklinge that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "our man was from this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, dermaβen in its ranks, in whose meat because the emotion of adultery, with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the face of verderbens to come."
On James Joyce: "the Odysseus' was in Paris in 1922 issued by Sylvia beach. It is one of the 8000er summit in the world literature, must be made to the North wall to climb, on the wall of the best mountaineers."
On William Faulkner: "The was a comical kauz.
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a Gutsbesitzers County and other times, he said that he was the son of a Black and a Krokodils.
Both dreams of a certain GröΒe. "
On louis-ferdinand céline: this writer took the insane cry from a bridge from the figure from Munich hinausgeschrieen, so that its response has been deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way out. Hallte that he made during a journey on which he himself took and with a speech full of violence against the würmern anflehte posterity.

On Virginia Wolf: " in her luggage, they had their depression.
The husband took it with utter normality, when it said that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen Ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.

On Pío Baroja: "What made Martín Santos because otherwise, than to try to Joyce in Baroja?
What intended for Benet, if he Baroja non-led to the arms of Faulkner?
What made Cela because, apart from the glory of that man to destroy themselves, so that he can put on this pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
My 70 years mother was last week by the district in the town of fuenlabrada love, a group of young people between 15 and 18 years in addition to their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling that we have obtained from a rescue and just six kilos, and then come out of the blue missed him two fußtritte and injured him so that difficult.
Our indignation, one can never be in words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where since the spass in a cheap aggression against a small and hilfloses animal, which is, of course, be on the leash.
On top of the suffocation attack, a woman who was walking cosy, as they get these people as a result of the incident, they even wanted to reprimanding feared for their own lives, because if so insane attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps, with a woman, a child, an older Mr or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
We have, of course, in a nahgelegen police department reported, however, we have great doubts about whether anything will bring and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what in the minds of these young people that they must begin to a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal amusing to find an animal that we love , society and friendship .
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people .
Michelin and fesvial together for the use of the helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the Helmgebrauchs especially among the younger motorcyclists as both companies announced today.
This initiative so that wants to draw attention to the importance of the helmgebrauchs, since it is ultimately the only schutzelement, the kopfverletzungen or even the death in the event of a motorradunfalls can prevent.

The sale of small lorries is rising again something
After nearly two years of the car market for small trucks to a light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, mean an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months gemäβ decrease, keep going with the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam figures presented.
However, these good figures are currently only with groβer caution to genieβen, since the comparison used reference data of November 2008, which is a particularly bad verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the growth in the last month, the gesamtzulassungen this 11 months still 40% below the sale of the previous financial year.
Since January , a total of 95,853 vehicles sold in this figure , but all vehicles , from which the Kleintransportermarkt is : descendants of passenger cars , pick-ups , Kleintransporter , small vans and lighter Kleinlastwagen / chassis .
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the groβteil of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of the purchase by a third-party financing.
So we need to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten cries of credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little help.
This plan is, however, not only for individuals, including the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if you are a kleintransporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a co2-ausstoss, not 160 grams per gefahrenen kilometres may exceed want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Again just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it is Imperative on the part of the state, is also a special attention to these Kleinlaster and, of course, to the Industriefahrzeuge (trucks and buses).
The autohändlervereinigung predicts for 2010 is a similar year as last, for which it with a verkaufsausfall (for passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was the case with the ABS and how it is now with the ESP stability control , must be on the brakes in emergency situations in the European cars .
In fact , they are already duty in all newly registered passenger cars and light kleintransportern , for the remaining vehicles , a karenzfrist set by the end of February 2011 .
The adopted by the European Union maβnahme aims to improve the protection of fuβgänger, however, these braking systems because of their operation also help many front-rear collisions.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical bremsmanövers system, on the basis of the drivers on the bremspedal trafficked bremsstärke recognises.
However, this system is not that pressure until the end.
According to the komponentenhersteller for the bosch-fahrzeuge research, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the zusammenstoss no longer to do so, on the bremspedal, half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against resorts with maximum force in the braking system and reduce the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1 000 fatal accidents, which fuβgänger harm to come, be prevented if all cars equipped with this type of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even less accidents - it is calculated that every fourth accident could be prevented with personenschaden - as soon as the so-called intelligent notbremssysteme popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, and at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then reacted to help him in the system, to increase pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent exercises maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as much as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that will launch the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to indicate that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, will in fact ensure that the affected side to any single point of the plan in advance.
And for this very reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and the governments of the countries in which it works, to postpone until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen GM said that it will in the next few days will take a decision on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that this is a decision as soon as possible.
GM exists, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports, has the backing of the Russian group Converg, is becoming more and more popular.
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to schlieβen Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold, will also continue.
at the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel used the engineers Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kilograms.
So, the first thing you renunciation on the automatic aufklappbare roof, a zeltleinwanddach replaced with manuellem accord alone has saved 21 kilo; thanks to the in this model aluminiumtüren used as the gt3 'disappeared' a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; auβerdem one has the kraftstofftank of 64 to 54 litres of reduced, so that other 7 kilos of savings; with the installation of sporting bacquet-sitzen again 12 and with the slight 19-zoll-felgen back five saved.
Then there was also due to the audio-system cdr-30 again six kilos less and the exchange of türgriffe by griffe from substance the lack of kilos.
Although he , too , with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available , the probefahrt with a car with 6-gängigen carried out handgetriebe , mainly on the smaller landstraβen of California , in bergstrecken , which really was very kurvig .
In his behaviour can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but not geführtdass he is no longer so sure would be on the straβe.
Rather, the opposite is the case: it for long, we no longer have a small and easy model Probegefahren, but also a sense of Groβer security at the Curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of it, his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders to curb rasen to recover and then all over again from its engine to get out...
He makes everything he says. the car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its management, which is just as communicative and precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motorsound for all tastes
The sound of his v6 boxers with 320 PS ( 10 more than the boxster 's ) is very successful and it cannot yet with the ' sport ' -option and by means of a system that can change the motorgeräusche , which has already been used for the first time in the panamera .
The beschleunigungsvermögen is unbelievably brutal, whether from the stand out or at the latest.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or Inconvenient.
The asphalt on the landstraβen on which we took with the boxster spyder was quite damaged , but the car meisterte the schlaglöcher well .
The electronic assistants had virtually nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we in some of these Curves and Rollsplitt ice in the morning.
In summary, it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, which has an indescribable fahrspass, otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster SS.
The car in February 2010 will come on to the market and 70.831 euros.

The baskonia takes a victory in Israel itself
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex Fuβballfeld of Maccabi Electra and comes to the first place in its group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic was with eight triple the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team from Vitoria , the major problem of herrmann , oleson , huertas or micov by a very broad sense of use and teamwork , even if they are to the bitter end to its victory muβten wait .
The great hits from the Perimeter out with 16 valued at three times contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten right from the start at the top on the agenda .
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out from the perimeter , it was already guess that you on the pitch with good aufgewärmten handgelenken .
It was English and teletovic , mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter .
The second quarter was little different, only that the team from what is for a innenseitiges game of barac chose and for the game of Eliyahu, on his return to the team with pfiffen and applause was received his home is to their advantage to break further develop (34-43).
already began to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points , including the " minus six " assessment of the mote already guess that this is not the best night of Brasilianers .
Nevertheless, the game was, despite the clear advantage in the recess still not decided and the Makkab�Er wanted to remind the Vitorianer once again that not everyone on the pitch, and you keep attacking the "hand of El�as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and pnini contributed central to ensuring that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get re-air and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, with nearly three successive triple and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that back on the ads table einberuhigender interval (54-67) was reported by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) could make.
The alavesen were in the last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San emeterio ( 60-75 ) already announced that it would allow anyone to you the victory in the first dreiβig minutes honestly deserved , taking away again .
Nonetheless resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried not to their team by three points from the line (70-77).
In spite of this, and although splinter because fouls in place, the team of Ivanovic was not to be defended well and even though the Israelis nor in the last minute aufholten (85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the most of Europe and a lot of money.
Complacently thanks to their game in the first quarter were the Andalusian start to dream. Aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and a Guillem Rubio, the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos, the intensity of the ereins unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a innenspiel between bourousis, vujcic and schortsanitis managed that the anzeigentafel in the 13th minute anzeigte 22-20 in their favour, the minute, because of a campaign almost to the original affray between the two Americans Beverley and Williams had come and so they were from being.

According to the most enticing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets was the uncertainty in the markets back again, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
to stabilize the markets , it was to the debt with the Direktkauf of assets and , indirectly , the liquidity for a free hand in interest rates , which is the zero , so that in this way the banks assets to buy .
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity, begin to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with their jahresversteigerung, the next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy , the economic recovery without these and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums .
The flüchtigkeiten the stock exchanges and the differences in unternehmensboni rise again, even if it is still a long way from the paranormalen amounts are at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, leading to an increase in the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, is not a degree of uncertainty, the defenders of the moral risk to silence the once again tried, with the leaders of the world economic policy an awareness, for what you had caused to the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, as they had slowed down a new day to dankesaktion beschlieβen should have.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren, in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
