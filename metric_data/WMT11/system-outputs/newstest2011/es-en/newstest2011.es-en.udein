What they mind? Neither knows nor ČSSD in Prague or the pastry to Voldemort
Of the new councillors ČSSD in the capital will have to be overcome, it seems, the language barriers, for obvious components Prague of the Board and the city council, to understand its revived companions of the Civic.
Aktuálně.cz the period "considered " for members of the new Council ČSSD to check the language skills of its marking slang that has emerged in recent years the Council when Prague ran current members of the coalition.
The dictionary, which codified and the cream used policy in Prague during the previous period, from Mayor Pavel Bém, involves some of the characters, situations and most publicized cases of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has found that the new councillors nearly known concepts do not understand them.
At least, that they say.
Voldemort "Who is that?"
"The truth is that I do not know."
"I am rather praguense a novice in politics," he said in his review of the terminology "colegueo" the deputy culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And as the veteran politician, reacted like Karel Březina.
May be familiar with the concept 'hole of golf. "
" is possibly the only expression preguntasteis all of which I use every once in a while. "
"If not, normally not to use slang ."
Of the glossary, whose published definitions Aktuálně.cz newspaper, last June before the Congress of the ODS vote, chose six illustrations, particularly those that are especially associated with the municipal authorities in Prague.
Socialists had to explain concepts' Voldemort ,"" greatest golf hole Prague, "" go back to the pastry "and" bull's neck ,"" betrayal of the capital " and "shield ."
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test, and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, which will be responsible for the future education in Prague, agreed in principle, but he returned to pick up the phone.
The fifth local councillor, Petr Dolínek declined directly to do so.
"I do not think these things go in or decide how amused the Civic Democrats."
"I don't care about them is how we understand in the implementation of our software," he said.
As we have seen, allegedly Kaucký Lukáš the councillor had not taken account of the fact that the title is a manifestation of one influential businessman and a friend of the former mayor Bém Roman Mr. Janoušek.
Kaucký to the floor "Voldemort" never said anything; the only word that got the review was the "greatest golf hole of Prague."
Blanka 'is the end of the tunnel ," reads Kaucký, which immediately added: "But I do know, rather, on the news.
"I am going to have to aim a language course," a joke.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the hole of golf Blanka the tunnel, but the Environment councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Then Social-Democrat Groups both know who is really Lukáš Plachý Voldemort and even knows where to find such a man; a suspicion the meaning of "to be the pastry ."
"I believe that he wants to say a company go to Prague" unveils Plachý soon to be that this is the headquarters of Mr. Janoušek companies.
Like Březina, indicates that such knowledge was the news, but that it did not use such language.
According to participants in the trial, including the Social-Democrat Groups no glossary so familiar from colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but I really think we do not have anything like that. "
"rather between us are using aliases, often doing puns or abbreviations with the names," says the chairman ČSSD praguense Petr Hulínský, Hulda call their party colleagues.
"In the college called Bříza me, but I don't know if my colleagues I draw well," admits his own nickname Karel Březina.
Tested Aktuálně.cz the newspaper the name and it works.
To his party colleagues, Weinert Děda is similar to ('yayo ") or less amicable Dědek ("old"), the agent, Miroslav Poche, which partnered before the cheating during the election, the party's patron, is nicknamed " Igráček "Playmobil") by certain of his colleagues.
Those nicknames are also expressions that tolerates only as the Social-Democrat Groups within the party.
Hulínský to dislike Hulda call it that, but even the other nicknames Aktuálně.cz newspaper discovered praguense for this president.
"Dr of the rights of the clubs," Petr recalls Hulínský appears to have earned his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the use of torture in the "witches," according to a brochure published
Defined women as witches in Burkina Faso to share certain characteristics.
Typically have an advanced age, it may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are unmarried and have no children.
Women who are "becoming " witches were sent to an isolated area so as not undermine the rest of the people.
"Men seldom such but suffer."
"Isolates were also healthy young women, as they help with the tasks and have children," he explains of a nun, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso is in a special residency of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
Local Government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure ."
Issued a leaflet that should help to avoid a witch hunt.
However, there is a fly in the ointment.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso did not know how to read," said the Standard newspaper Die on the disadvantages of awareness by writing.
Also accusations of witchcraft are commonplace in other African countries.
Ghana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso last week died Ammy Hemmah, 72 years ago, when the two men and three women were tortured, filled the gasoline and burned.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claimed that was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, she was set on in the oil that is used for the ritual unciones.
Was set ablaze when the panel wanted to "expel evil spirits " of the woman.
Isolation "Witches " support people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a businessman, aged 42 in Burkina Faso: "human souls devoradores always represented a risk," he said.
While Burkina Faso the Government tries to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year have participated in the president.
"The Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of her aunt, which launched a major hunt for the witches who, presumably, had been connected with his death and had tried to kill the president with the black magic."
"Shamans for help to nearby Guinea, all protected by the police, the military and the president's personal escort, were forcibly to the men and women have been chosen randomly between peoples to the Gambian president's property at Kanilai," it stated in its report Amnesty International.
In the farm, those arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effect which, moreover, were caused intestinal problems and kidney failure.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay at the farm.
After international pressure, finally freed around 1,000 people arrested.
Bakala of tenant: Heated with charcoal stoves and sign a rental most high
Men, older and very strong, the doors of the center of the company's customer focus Byty RPG "coal magnate " Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Papers under his arm was a new lease with the rental of three floors: Yours, his daughter and his son, who is serving a sentence.
Them the three just looting the liberalization of the rent.
Than 3,500 at CZK month, paid his son from the beginning of next year for the 4,100 kroons for a floor separate kitchen with two stays second category.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating boiler is based on solid fuel, " shows the finger at the man in a new contract of their child, whose signature is on full powers.
"But he signed it, " he explains through angry, resigned.
BytyOKD.cz the civil association, described the new conditions of rental as "inappropriate and indecent," recommends those tenants who did not sign new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide for reporting on how to proceed in such cases.
But, before that, the men only a shrug.
"Each said that one thing," he says with a bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory evidence of liberalisation.
After New Year would happen with the vast majority of the floors, in the Czech Republic, they are so far under a rent regulated.
Why, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit a "laboratory " in person.
Mining the waiting room for four is an RPG of Ostrava and, on Tuesday at 9 a.m., was already full.
Fair along the doors are security guards and at your side, a machine to catch the number.
2011 "Rent " can be read under a luminous button from its touchscreen.
To pulsarlo, leaves the machine an papelito with a number.
Not nearly enough time to read or "157" and because the number appears on the big screen at the top of the chamber.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Shortly afterwards, the marriage of elderly is a wonder, but the crowd in the room is not here by the new housing.
Most of the people come to solve routine problems, as formerly: Requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new lease will be in Ostrava in the mailboxes of the tenants, most of the 44 apartments belonging to RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty proposes in his letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38 per cent.
On 18 November it opens a special window within the customer centre to the new rent.
"Has been in place for a week, that is starting," he replied, after hesitating briefly, workers who are at it, when the customer provides as a journalist.
The liberalisation and the old flats Bakala to miners are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the election, it was the loud and clear the vice president of the parliament, who was born in Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek, ČSSD, and they now appear in the newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later, I want a new one."
"I changed the bloody mess in the toilet ," the man mentioned in desahoga the introduction.
According to workers, for the time being more than anything else to determine whether the retired are a discount on the rent if they sign in time and promises to offer a special of RPG.
Also will receive half of the discount on the rental tenants remaining February to sign a new contract by December 15.
However, shop the "liberalisation" mining no doubt fail to dispel doubts the avalanche.
"360 clients who were here yesterday, just asked for rent in 2011, some 40 or 50 people," said the employee of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG is on the website and in their meetings on the posting individual contracts if necessary.
If the two sides do not reach an agreement on leasing, it must settle the issue of an independent judge.
"Is not a threat, but on the only possible way of proceeding and in full accordance with the law, " he warns the RPG in its pages.
"Here it is not going to prosecute anyone," said one of the clerks Byty RPG and a man who was found in the street in front of the customer service centre gives him, at least in part, the reason for this.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and are 5,000 food for me; I do not have the means to go to the courts," he says.
, but immediately cast doubt the woman.
"Have to wait and see."
'Mr Zaorálek media alerts them not to sign, so maybe people expected, "he said.
The rent regulation will no longer be in the majority in the Czech Republic at the start of 2011 and, under RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
Current rents " still doesn't cover even the amounts needed to maintain the heart of the community, " said Pavel Klimeš, portfolio manager of the company's residential Byty RPG, which adds that the neglected state of irritation to a community fund for tenants is for owners, the main reason for an increase in rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010, the RPG could invest in rental flats with four billion dollars in the four years it will be from 2011 to 2014, the number will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, with the seating of the waiting room, now echoes some data that highlighted in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15 per cent and less apply to 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90 per cent of properties by RPG."
"In addition, there will be a maximum monthly CZK 7.50 per square metre, " shown on the screen.
Only increased by 38 per cent, the rent of 400 flats of RPG of the portfolio.
"In those circumstances, it is an increase from a few extremely low amounts, to 19.66 per square metre, " indicates the RPG.
Apartments in 2,600, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promised liberalisation does not affect in one fell swoop to rents, but they are amongst escalará four to eight years.
Furthermore, adds the next compromise: The company will invest all the money from the rent rise (see chart) in new flats, mainly savings in heating: Windows and heating.
Priority will be given to individuals who sign up to the agreement to rent.
Have architects understood that offices also need nursery
Brno Avriopoint the administration building at the company's new headquarters Arch.Design.
Nobody should say too that hides inside a tiny nursery with everything they own to these premises: Coloured walls, furniture and even creative a miniature park on the pavement outside.
Since October of last year, may be open to children of employees of Arch.Design.
Arch.Design architectural project of the company, which left numerous buildings known of Brno, believed from the earliest sketches Avriopoint of the building include a space for your mini-kindergarten.
In the business working around 90 people, mainly in the age of baby boom and wanted to be allowed that the architects could Draftspersons and get back to work after maternity leave.
Along with the possibility of a reduced working hours, the nursery is one of the benefits that it offers its employees Arch.Design in the context of their social agenda.
Clients and architects in this way, they have the chance to combine a demanding career with caring for children.
The mini-kindergarten was a picture of its own employees Arch.Designu and, with the support of the leadership managed to obtain funding from the European Union and from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten the company is funded through the European Social Fund with the SOP of human resources and employment, as well as the state budget to the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the (more than 2.8 million koruny) could buy equipment and, after two years, qualified personnel and recruiting services.
When funding runs (two years), the company has an obligation to maintain Arch.Design in operation the mini-kindergarten with its own funds for three years.
Preparation for the project lasted a year, and in the filing the request of the company had contributed funding NYTC Rating.
Care of children is in the hands of skilled personnel; in addition, they are present throughout the day for their care of a nurse and a lecturer at the Department of Education now a nursery for children of any age, although most of them are less than three years.
Given that it is a "mini-kindergarten," just simultaneously can accommodate up to five children, while more shifts to visit during the day.
Operation of the childcare is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same rights to use the centre - independently of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an education and individual care about the content of the programme of the mini-kindergarten are rivalling habitual early childhood education programme.
Children not only in her playing, but they also receive a quality education: From basic learning until preparation for the school to teach English.
Class provides not only toys and board games, for a computer, but also for the children.
The presence of younger children in their own company to create an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can go to see their children at all times and avoiding stressful afternoon to collect children from school when they are located far from their place of work.
So, parents are more productive while they are working.
It is not surprising that this will create a natural connection of loyalty between the worker and their employer.
This way Arch.Design is somewhere between sign that companies offer a big advantage in the hiring of new workers, to support the family, and, ultimately, this marketing program reinforced the staff.
The bone remains fascinando house after 100 years.. 'interiors look at Gaudí
The roof is the prehistoric one flank lagarto, the staircase column remind a dinosaur and the balconies seem to open a fish's mouth.
Casa Batlló is, in Barcelona, the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because its a similar fashion to a skeleton, a Premises apodaron "the bones."
Its organic forms, colors bright, innovative use of stone fragments of tile mosaics and a facade which reminds the scales and the omnipresent curvadas lines it mildly, this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house, plays with oníricas lines, colors and delicate texturas drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, there has been a geometric, and a order carefully thought out.
Night, the entire front of the house, still seems more impressive, given that is illuminated so that an improved brightness of the colors.
Weaves and the torque of the forms we still surprised within them as well.
Wavy timber copy on the window frames, handrails, the ornaments of the doors, and the subtitles mirillas.
Casa Batlló, which is in the district of Eixample in the spirited street number 43 on the Passeig Grácia of business emerged from the reshuffle of a house of the year, the division brought architect 1877 Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house is completed in the year 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted in toppling the previous building and start from scratch, but he quickly agreed to the idea of a rebuilding of Gaudí novel and cheaper.
However the Casa Batlló, consisting of several apartments, not only devised the Antoni Gaudí.
Worked on the design of architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Indeed, in their fittings to design the apartment appeared representing the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
Other workers on the facade also creators and artists.
Collaboration proposals was Casa Batlló of the start of a successful collaboration Jujol to Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the park and house Güell Milá of Gaudí, in other parts of the same.
Due to an organic form, the premises shortly after the finalization apodaron "the bones."
Others, and due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the villa to the yawns.
It also said that, at the top of the building, is the devil of St George, the patron in Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hidden religious grounds.
Gaudí screened at the home of a single system for the era of central heating vents with ventilation and fireplaces typical.
Their inclination may be strange and forty five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply with construction standards at all the time, and refused to be influenced by them.
Still, the building gained permission from the beginning, although obviously with data reported on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, upon its completion, the City was less impacted by the outcome which it requested that it be corrected.
I resented that, for example, would include the construction of columns even sidewalk.
Arrangements never did, quite the reverse: Only 15 days after a request from the Municipality, Josep Batlló sought (and gained) for permission to rent the top two floors of the building.
The lower floors are installed the same owner.
In the gallery on the second floor and the living room was on the third floor and the bedrooms the private part of the apartment.
Apparently, it was the ground floor to a jewellery store.
The house, six floors is completely crossed by a staircase leading up to the terrace on the roof.
The key elements of the reform were to break all the angles and straight lines as curved walls filling them in.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connectivity the space.
Common party can be connect completely by opening the doors of the lounges, and a wider group it can communicate this way without trouble, without renouncing the privacy needed to discuss more intimate.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only won a new facade, unusual and a roof but also additional two floors.
Gaudí it is impressive how to play with the light blue and white tiles covering the internal courtyard, and skylights.
Game between the two colours is the maximum amount of light on all floors of the house.
Is based on the principle that white reflects more light to dark colors, which conversely absorb the sun's rays.
Any person can visit the Casa Batlló, in 2005, that was added to the list of World Heritage Site by Unesco.
Into the first floor of the home is the apartment more spacious and more stretched those accessible to the public.
Owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, and to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famed artist.
Visits confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very profitable business and expanded joint visits to the area and in the loft, including the terrace on the roof.
The price of entry at the monument is not negligible is USD 16.50 euros, although students, pensioners and to tourist cards holders receive a 20 per cent discount.
The sum is considerably higher than the price of the entry of of Gaudí other buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with their rigs lagarto should make friends quickly any resident of neighbouring houses and visiting him at home.
How it chooses somier and the mattress: Women and men are different things
Nothing of a pompous for the bed, but what really gives good quality to his bed is to lie - the mattress and somier.
First and foremost should be supplemented to the perfection to adapt to specific users.
During the election come in numerous factors, including weight, height, gender and health status of the owner.
Is also important, the type of interior in which it sits somier and the mattress.
A typical example?
For example, in a hut at the end of the week that traditionally have no heating, latex mattresses should not be used because he was "getting hot " at a slower pace.
In addition, usually weighing considerably more than traditional polyurethane the mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to return more often.
If they are not the centre channels airing properly and, above them, are on a strong foundation, retain moisture within even moho may appear below.
When choosing a bed, also influence social mores.
Who has spent a lot of time abroad, often a used mattress with a fluffy layer high and it will be difficult to be on a hard surface and lower.
"nearly all the players returned to hockey in the NHL here complained that not sleeping as well."
"pulverised on their shoulders, and hips need mattresses with stubs a soft layer viscoelástica of."
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes to time problems with the nervous system and, therefore, poorly received information of the skin and the joints," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes in furniture acolchado.
Many hockey players, the same as other clients, have long preferred viscoelástica of the mattresses.
"Today there is no longer a problem, because they have such good Italians and Tempur Magniflex, Tropico Czech but also brand."
Is no longer be a player of power appreciate viscoelástica in the NHL.
This "miracle" is a very simple way.
Optimized its rigidity and is depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing puts pressure; at night, he will not seek as spin after a tough match.
Simply sleep better.
Viscoelástica also operates as the protection against the weaknesses.
To choose the size of cushion, its altitude added to the length of your feet, that is, between the ages of 21 and 34 inches.
A man or a woman with a height of approximately 180 cm require bed between 210 to 220 centimetres.
The minimum width for a person to be in a double room, 90 cm, at total 180 cm.
In the case of the individual rooms, for example single, is recommended as a minimum of between 120 and 140 inches.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, he can implement a simple to calculate the standard width: The lips lie above, should have his hands towards the elbow encogidas comfortably," engineer advised Helena Prokopová, expert Cechu čalouníků dekoratérů to, who has spent many years to address the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furnishings, which taught in specialist schools.
In the double rooms, each of which requires its own somier and mattress, as well as for the purchase is that attention to combine height of the mattresses.
In case contrary, it will be necessary to assemble the somieres at different altitudes, which it is not always possible in every bed.
Foam mattresses should take a minimum height of 14 centimetres, models with berths within a minimum of 15cm, of whom at least three centimetres that are in the forms and were adapted to the edges.
"In with the hand or touch it to sitting on the mattress without doubt not be detectable the docks" cautions Prokopová Helena.
Each mattress requires somier a kind of time.
Those dormitories acolchados completely, in which the base and mattresses were as the Siamese, have no sense in the bedroom.
Breathing poorly and the mattresses not wash their grounded can, which is often done now.
And, as each evening transpiramos between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years, the mattress would begin to remind us of a great (and crowded) screen.
For this reason, experts reject the slogans which talk about a life of the mattress until 25 years, or even a lifetime.
However, everything has a but.
So, sellers give a word of advice: Mattress with a width of 120 or 140 centimeters, warn carefully cleaning and washing from the grounded, yet better add a protective buffer, which can be withdrawn easily and washing.
Even mattress covers are currently manufactured with zipper down around its perimeter, which are open to two parties (something very significant for the washing and the size of a washing machine!), the models in their handling larger (and for a single person), by lifting the mattress it may seem to be a scrap between fly weight and a heavyweight.
Into bed, instead an somier, is table one firm?
Never!!
Beds for as much passing an evening designed for the visits.
However, it should be done (if you have not already) vents in the table and it should be used as a mattress with berths within a minimum height and 15 cm with berths in the exchanges (including German and a fluffy layer Taschenfederkern).
PUR mattresses should not be used on such a basis.
Somieres the film for not containing articulables and foils between 14 and 18, are use latex mattresses (sandwich or mattresses for example, a combination of latex and coconut fibre, but it is always better somier with a greater number from foils, 28 or more, where the illustrations of the lumbar area are strengthened and may regulate its rigidity.
Articulables somieres the film must not be used as a mattress of docks, since it is not reacting at reclinación.
Further adjustment of the rigidity of the slats, can also be used for the protection of your shoulders.
Fixing it is a special film that may pressurise or even tip the slats so that "surround" very well on their shoulders during sleep.
Men, with some very broad shoulders, it is something that is very important.
Even remember them manufacturers of mattresses that in the "masculine ," began to utilize a more precisely mild area around their shoulders.
Also to women, for whom putting a zone more flabby around the hips.
More stringent for customers, there are crosses somieres with a lattice structure or on buffer multitorsión with the call.
Pressure is distributed between different points and lowering the tension.
Must also take into account that, while the use of mattress somier and adequate, if you use a pillow (big and bad "mullida"), will be the majority of the benefits.
The basic rule was simple: Pillow should sustain head the corner and they can only reach the shoulders, so that they can relax the muscles of the same.
The right size recommended 50 x 60 cm, something normal, for example in Scandinavia.
To lie down side the pillow should be at the same level, when combined with the strengthened somier with shoulders or in the softest region under the mattress) to the height of their shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original thatched fillers mattresses.
Manufacturers still rely, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, to blends.
Indeed, are fashionable the organic mattresses.
The raw oil, with the manufacturer of polyurethane foam, is filled with natural oils, such as soybean oil or castor.
In fact, nearly all producers known used soybean.
"Biological, the mattresses, it wants to say that the centre was built solely of materials of natural origin," said Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus company.
Are also used during the manufacture of natural substances from mattresses, aloe vera, one of the first.
But you can also choose the microcápsulas, released a fresh aroma lavanda or in woods.
There are also differences for men and women.
Whilst men being "cool " with plant extracts of breeze for the mattress cover refresque and absorb heat in the body, women prefer" heat "by the decision.
The extract of red pepper, improving the flow of blood, so women feel more warmth.
Are the favourite now?
Foam mattresses made of cold is more porous, with a cell structure, making it more permeable than the more normal of polyurethane and permeability.
Diverse mix of the rigid foam mattresses viscoelástica cold and allow the manufacture of various areas to know quite where the head, shoulders and his heels.
Quality mattress was a seven thousand kronor set you back to the top.
Therapeutic functions tend to have a lower VAT, which would be viewed as a medical means.
The first was that this advantage Gumotex was in the Czech Republic.
Complicated somieres and save in the mattresses.
Sometimes can approve bids by the manufacturers or retailers, who sometimes are two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, offering Magniflex mattresses Duofreeze brand with a memory foam with Memory 11.990 by joining the foundation.
Is the second charge.
Era with a cell structure viscoelástica open and dense the material began "cosmic " Tempur.
Material initially developed for NASA, because during takeoffs eulogies astronauts came under tremendous strain.
Tempur ablanda it tighten up with the heat and with the cold.
Accordingly, the human body warm, has a best adapted perfect and indeed their pressure.
Consequently, it is ideal to prevent ulcers, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Foam viscoelástica not just used in mattresses, but also in health products, for example for pillows that were planted under the legs and the ease, and its movement.
Domestic manufacturers, for instance, use foam Eucatherm Twinsaver or C, and so forth.
Parents increasingly using tracking devices on people to control their children
The fear for the kids is increasingly more people think by GPS (s).
The system, initially meant to track the vehicles, also can follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case such as the disappearance of the girl of nine years Anička Janatková.
By the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of matches, but had soon reduced to the size of a watch.
I gave a lot of people fear the event and began missing Anička to inform on the tools available to protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading their privacy.
"All we are trying to tell us that this is not about spying, but another way to reduce the potential for a tragedy," said Petr Pilin Macro Weil of the company, one of the providers of tracking devices to the Czech market.
"I recognise that, in some cases, can be abused to such devices, for example, if they get into a bag for someone without his knowledge, but we have not yet come up with these cases ."
"The majority of the customers actually bought for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his view, boys should always know what it is for the "cajita" and how they will be used in case of emergency.
Dana Bočková warns a child psychologist about the fact that if the child does not want to do, just pull it.
'Even the smallest children showing great creativity to lose intentionally selected things if you want to avoid that they are monitored ."
"Before, the parents looked forward immensely in mobiles, but they were put out as easily as the tracking," affirms Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether, in the event of an attack such a device, it is really helpful.
"If it is an abduction, he virtually always check if a child carries some kind of electronic device which could reveal their location."
"Now it is the phone."
"spreading the use of tracking devices, it also found, since its sale will no doubt be under a great deal of publicity."
"In such cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of a paedophile a makeshift attack.
Robert Čech according to the company's DRC Monitoring, which delivers up to both vehicles and people, even if, in the wake of an attack, they destroy immediately the tracking device, their presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured so that sends regular position after a certain period of time ."
"If is, at least, will the final position of the person in question. "
"The devices most expensive a meter integrated are inclined, so if a person simply resbala and was motionless, the devices will be immediately followed by a warning with the position in question ," asserts Čech.
In his opinion, a service of this kind can be, even for smart mobile phones as navigation, in which should only install a special software.
The problem of monitoring units today, is that at the moment there is a device with a similar size to a box of matches, or mobile phones.
Hence, could be lost.
Macro Pilin according to Weil, for that reason they are currently conducting trials with devices that appear to be a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage of a potential attacker who might not be identified by the system.
Identify it or "after a period of time, which can make the police to gain time," he adds.
While tracking devices were placed on her wrist or clinging, will continue to use the same technology that is used to help monitoring of vehicles.
Is checking the position with a GPS system, which is used in the standard navigation in the car) combined with a mobile phone service that informs the current position.
The Army has enough to surround as fuses across the Czech Republic, but only lasts two years.
The Czech Army bought 445 kilometres to ignite explosives, fuse.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence, added to his arsenal of 224 miles off.
Thus, hold stocks to 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the initial impulse is two years, four, at the very least.
The army bought the initial impulse for explosives to STV Group, a. s. by forty million kroner.
General's staff responded to MF DNES to justify the purchase of such a large amount of the initial impulse, saying troops needed for the training exercises off 60 kilometres per year.
According to calculations from the pyrotechnics of the Army, with whom he liaised MF DNES, it was decided, however, in this case, they should do these manoeuvres with frequent explosive use of all of the generals also each year, senior officers in command, even secretaries and cleaners.
Exempt or not wanted, the Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and army captain, Vlastimil Picek.
Only it might justify that the military spends 60 kilometres of fuse.
Length equates to 25,000 such explosions.
While well off, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the other hand, as the experts say, to the initial formation of each new job comes with a minimum of two metres of a fuse, the army would have to buy a new (including the consumption of those engineering units or special) enough for the 225 stocks mentioned above.
Soldiers in the brigade early intervention recently before personally complained Mr Vondra ammunition just because they say that have for a variety of weapons, which were restricted and even the shooting practice as a matter of money.
And not talk about the absence of any underwear.
"I do not understand who we buy such quantities off repeatedly. "
"But it is their decision, and of course, you know, why act as well."
"For us, the army is a good customer in that, as a company, we are trying to meet," she admits, the sales director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defend the hundreds of kilometres that fuse also saying take stock of this "ammunition " for at least ten years.
However Jan Děcký of STV Group, indicates that the fuse only has a lifespan of four years, and in the case of the fireworks to the army or police for two years.
"If is stored in conditions perfect, can last up to four," says one of the soldiers, of the potential criticism of the army, which does not want to give his name.
Following the conclusion of their useful life, each found ammunition must carefully to see if I still trusted and not hurt the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another Ministry's argument is that, when we bought, 445 kilometres fuse had obtained a discount.
"We bought a 60 per cent lower than last year at the request of the 244 km," said the spokesperson Pejšek shopping centre from the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: Annual consumption of fuse of the pyrotechnic the police to remove the ammunition from the Second World War and left by the Soviet army, already does not exceed 1,500 metres long.
In addition, the police are always requests only the amount just as exhausted their ammunition before the end of its useful life.
I decided, for reasons of security, for the fireworks, and, in the meantime, you can get rates more modern and reliable basis.
The Ministry now has clear difficulties to stop tens of thousands of tons of unexploded munitions from the time of the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200 thousand people is preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
Pyrotechnic according to DNES MF spoke to, after a couple of years will be the next problem with the present one, there will be hundreds of miles away that fuse old, which are now buying "cheaper ."
I am so far live contacts that the quiz get
Winning the contest for the "Entrepreneur of the Year " helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise to his hotel.
The latest edition, won the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year " by the enterprising of Liberec Pytloun Lukáš 28 years.
Their success story seemed to have been lifted from a film.
Lukáš Pytloun encantaba him to travel.
Abroad he realised that there was a lack of accommodation in Liberec quality at a good price.
With the savings they brought with seasonal work abroad and a loan from the bank bought a home that was half demolished five floors.
Bearing in mind that it is still exploring his third year in the university, was really brave.
"At the present time, the value of housing in our area gave me the impetus to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
Began to rent the first floor rebuilt with foreign workers.
All income derived those invested in the building again, but gradually turned into an annuity of the 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he was able to gradually reopen in Liberec four pensions, two restaurant style and two hotels with a total capacity of some 300 in all categories of residential care.
The easiest of all, it was, until recently, the hotel design Pytloun of four stars.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"I have just signed a contract with a hotel or at the Ostrov Tisé, we have sold our concept of franchising, and others are showing interest in a franchise of Pytloun," said the businessman, last year's number one.
"In the sale of licences to the opening of hotels helped in large measure the act of winning the contest of" Business of the year ', "adds Pytloun grateful.
The victory increased his fame and popularity as much as the surroundings at Liberec.
"I recognised on the street, I am still often happy, and, I must say, it was very nice," she recalls.
Without doubt, it recommends to all the world that any company that wants to participate in the competition.
But believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already profitable.
States that, to date, remains living on the known contacts and that, without competition, it may not have been.
"With some people who met with the competition I have started to work together."
Reputation associated with success, in his view, had also placed on employees
In total around 70.
"I have seen that shows greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that is widely recognised."
"It's not, by a long chalk, my own personal success, but that is the result of the hard work of the entire team.
"Only in the event that is my name that appears on the front page," he said modestly Lukáš Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a year more than we have been at sleepy Farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of winning, it is possible that the worst has now passed Farmet.
Farmet the owner of the company, Dr. Karel Žďárský, he received the first award in the latest edition's Vodafone "Company of the Year" last year in the House "Slav," Prague.
The jury acknowledged its efforts, which failed to convert a small workshop Skalice Česká technician in a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that I found the prize not only to me, but to all my colleagues and our confidence has improved to combat competition," said the winner of the last year.
Farmet the history of the company began with a desire to do something useful.
Which is why, when the government proposed to Karel Žďárský father of the rent from a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of properties during Communism, no doubt, too, resigned his seat on the company that analysed and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father, in piles of plastic.
Shortly afterwards and began to specialise in plant oil presses.
Eight years after it became the world's largest manufacturer of automatic presses the center of Europe.
Also had an increased presence that is not specialized public after their success in the competition in the media.
"not just our customers have started to look at the mark Farmet as considerably better, but also to assess foreign partners began a partnership with a company that had been the most successful in the country," said Karel Žďárský.
Last year was perhaps not a single sample Farmet in the euphoria of victory.
Also gained recognition for business until the year 2008, and, in part, of 2009.
2009 and the year was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached many citizens, causing companies stopped its investment projects, and began to limit the purchasing of new equipment or technology.
"We, of course, not just get rid of this situation."
"Income was reduced by 40 per cent, we have had to restrict output and we even had some redundancies," said Karel Žďárský.
A viable venture must, at times, even unpopular measures to take.
However, check the situation and kept the profits of the company, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where expenditure Farmet not cut was in the research and development.
"Subsidies have constructed a centre of research and training, strengthening the presence in the international market and got excellent appraisals at fairs' national, reads Žďárský.
Everything indicates that had already put the crisis behind it.
Revenues continued to rise, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expected to bring a sense of victory, but, in a calmer atmosphere, " said Karel Žďárský.
Survey reveals that a ridiculous standards
Absurdity of the survey the year is part of the tournament for the fourth time.
Already has succeeded in eliminating some rules are ridiculous.
Winner unknown of the new edition of the survey was the absurdity the obligation to pursue the administration documents that officials can access online.
Decision adopted by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
E.g. social security administration requested a copy of the commercial register, although their officers can get to two movements of a mouse.
Thanks to the poll, this has changed.
"The Czech government on social security will no longer be an excerpt from the company registry when a policyholder's exertion of control," said the spokeswoman of Jana Buraňová ČSSZ.
The purpose of the survey is to consult on absurdity of this year and the rules they must abide by the rules that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, form part of the tournament for the fourth time to the business publication noviny Hospodářské and begins to create similarly abuse among the general public.
Compared to last year's edition with the involvement of three thousand voter this year reached nearly four thousand.
And it is not surprising, as we still have the legal obligations that need to be respected for several well simply for trading.
"Perhaps in many roles needed for tax returns are in first place, " said Karel Havlí * ek of the Association of Small and medium sized enterprises and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic.
Years, the simplification of corporate standards it is a stated aim of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation improved, especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, in terms of the conditions to be a corporation, the Czech Republic is in fourth position, eight points worse than last year.
The absurdity of the year competition was held for the first time in 2006 and was repeated every year, in the same way.
Anyone can suggest any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when it closed the contest.
Proposals may be on the webpage www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of a contest to choose the seven candidates "antipremio ," and in October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz absurdita www.ihned.cz. and /.
Gana the absurdity that receives the most votes.
To the survey this year, there were more than one hundred, including 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
Those examples sent both the employers and professional associations, and journalists.
Among the finalists " the contest was, for example, the requirement for all cars for maintaining roads and highways to pay the tolls or employers with 20 employees, two offices and two bathroom walls painted every two years.
The list for the 1970s proposed this year is released in the pages of the tender.
The announcement of the competition, which is always made in early November in Wenceslas Square, Prague, as part of an event that usually participate in the political and social world of personalities.
This year, for instance, attended this event, and the competition was Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and medium sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
Economic prosperity, "the state cannot be maintained if you continually puts restrictions on businessmen, so my aim is to eliminate a minimum of $30 per year (which currently trade unnecessarily complicate," was announced by the Minister of Industry and Trade (DFAT) Kocourek Martin.
Efforts to remove the absurd rules are not in tatters.
In 2007, which was the most annoyed people the responsibility of the employer to inform with a notice of three days at the business office permanent operating in the area, with the intention of going to an exhibition or presentation.
This duty was abolished in the new law.
The duty, which was in second place in terms of the number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the quality of communication in the office working on part of its foreign workers working travel for up to 30 days, and it was repealed in the bill, dubbed the Green Card.
And the third time lucky.
The absurdity of the 2009 was the year for regulation of the physical therapist in his consultation with a large mirror, a fridge and weighing machines two of soil.
This is why, this year, the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that he had removed the obligation to have a fridge.

For this new special subcategory of this year's edition the Vodafone chief contest 2010 Enterprise provided firms for which the commercial success is not the only goal in the long term.
History of each of them is inspiring and would enable us to write a separate article.
While the type of activities varies between a completely, and another, the common denominator is the support and consideration.
In one case, it is, for example, of people with disabilities in other personal problems or health of employees.
Among the 14 finalists all the Republic was, for example, the company's software from Et Netera praguense, supports the formation of teams holding informal sports among its workers, after being involved in various sports tournaments.

Olomouc in the accounting company won MiRyz Soft, which has reduced the working hours, even below the mean of 35 hours per week, not to reduce their wages.

Police made the arrests during a public auction on the courthouse the Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
Police made several arrests against corruption in front of the agricultural fund in the past few days.
Those detectives was handcuffed to a local businessman in the media sector and the property entrepreneur Luboš G.
As it seems, the attempt to manipulate a public auction for the restoration of rights in a way that the land auctioned off as an individual could receive.
Must pay for this for half a million kronor Luboš G..
"For the time being I can only say that the police search for a person, for bribery during a public auction and bidding," he told the head of the general prosecutor právo of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment is not at liberty to divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours the police leaked the businessman of 46 years.
On the way that he was able to influence a government auction, given the paucity of official information, we can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Černá Lubomíra právo responded to questions saying that the police carried out the actual arrest in the Pilsen headquarters, and it was during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our employees," he said.
According Černá, the auction called "Contest for the transfer of land, in accordance with the law of the land " and is taking place at a number of interested parties in relation to the ground.
"These individuals, during the conference, provide superior value in return, must be moved before they are announced, the value of the land. "
"In the light of the bid, it is determined its buyers and, thereafter, the Agricultural Fund transferred the site to the person who provides the larger supply," explained a spokeswoman for the fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was to present the collection and, given that he is a person at the same time interested because purchased several restitution rights, suggested to stakeholders on the ground that it would not participate in the auction.
For this, he was gaining a commission.
This may explain the fact that, at the time of the arrest, I had much money.
O.G. Luboš special had contacts in the Pilsen Fund long ago.
Contained in the case of the former leader of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of shipping replacement land for which had already been aired a decision.
E.g. Luboš G. has to obtain the Fund projected land for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in a place where it should build one large road pole Borská industrial zone.
Later, changed quite beneficial with the magistrate for a house in the historic heart of the city with a very high value.
In this case, the city council has had to intervene because otherwise blocked sites would avoid the construction.
Families will have to pay additional costs of several hundreds kronor per month.
Those households will have to pay since January, not just for all types of energy, but also water and electricity, by heating and, in some cases, rental income higher.
Accordingly, the families will have to learn on the job, starting in January, several hundred of the more than a month now.
The price of electricity increases at 4.6 per cent, the gas about 2 per cent, with some cities will have to pay up to 10 per cent more on the supply of water, and many also are increasing the cost of central heating.
The surge of electricity for families living in apartments should amount to approximately SEK 100 more per year than they do now.
However, the main supplier of electricity decreased prices, due to the fact that increasing the support for the production of energy from renewable sources, solar in particular.
However, gas will be dearer moderation, especially at a time when more is used the heat and, therefore, greater consumption.
In this case, it should also have a couple of hundred more kroner the year.
While electricity and gas prices across the country, the price change of district heating ranges from one place to another.
Rising prices mainly the biggest municipality the plans.
For example, households to Pardubice in Hradec Králové or paid since January by central heating plus approximately 50 kronor per month, while families of Liberec paid more than $1,000 extra kroner the year.
Prague residents should also withstand an increase of 9 per cent of the price of water, and space heating, especially in the case of city infrastructure to raise the rent.
If the lease does not vary, praguenses paid 6.8 per cent extra.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current rates are among the highest, the two rates was a 7.4 per cent rise.
Can significantly increase the prices of rentals 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will be completed in January.
E.g. company CPI Byty, which owns in Usti nad Labem about 2,500 flats, from the rent will rise in January to a rate of 100%.
The company will bring to justice those who may not agree to the new rent.
Rent regulated, benefiting approximately 300,000 residents of flats, may increase next year by up to 10 per cent.
Young Czechs Fernet with rum, and they were drunk the beer is no longer so, because it slowly effect
Fernet, rum, vodka stolen whiskeys and even good to his parents.
These beverages which are leading to young drinkers getting medical care with a lower age to 15 years.
Children who have just left hospital in the steadily overcoming the hangover is no longer an exception.
This stems from experience of doctors who find themselves with such admissions to paediatric cases in the hospital.
"I drink beer or wine is no longer fashionable because emborracharles to take a long time. "
"Now they are fashionable drinks strong ," instructed the head of paediatric právo Hospital Hořovice in central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
"When unable to hold it a bottle to his father from the cupboard, that may be, but they are typically of Fernet vodka and trafficking."
Vodka "has the advantage of being slim with juice and not smell so much," he explains.
It also confirms a spokesman for the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
Normally ," it is usually of Fernet or rum."
Alcoholic beverages are these "modern, particularly among schoolchildren. "
"In some cases, using spirit that they took in house," adds Jurinová.
Pelikán the head says, drinkers are thirteen and fourteen years, which often occur in hospitals.
Hořovice before, which has been working since early this year, he worked for a decade in the paediatrics Motol, where ambulances carried young people from nearby areas.
Gal had to enter a "maybe four times. "
"Began at age 12, when brought with 3.5 for alcohol in the blood, along with a mix of ecstasy," says the department's doctor about this case.
"I had been at the fair for some celebration Holešovice dance."
"The interesting thing is that, for his mother and he had been surprised to find that her daughter disappear 48 hours ," is surprised the head.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even clear their tolerance towards drinking by their children, which are seen as the main cause of the rise in the level of alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts note that, in the case of children, it is not possible to talk itself of dependence.
"It is understood from alcoholic to a person who has a chronic alcohol dependency in the past several years, with all the associated phenomena, which does not occur in children."
"In people who repeatedly drink alcohol, but there is a family background or systematically failed ," explains head Pelikán.
Jurinová according to the spokesperson, earlier this year at the clinic's pediatric Motol hospitalizaron be until midNovember 40 children drunk.
However, statistics only show that came with a severe food poisoning and must stay in the hospital.
Youth drinkers, after doctor peddling, they go home with her parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which boys are simply met after school and they are drinking spirits, for seasonal swings Pelikán are three noteworthy: Witches, End Year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, drink by the bad notes or, instead, celebrate the start of the holiday period."
"In the day I got to see the witches in admissions until seven children drunk at the time," adds Pelikán.
Those drinkers to spend the night in a drug detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage of the next day suffered a terrible hangover not at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration) and the glucose needed, avoid injecting with a serum glucose and the nutrients the body is lacking.
"States have been much better, because after a rocky evening rose well and not hurts anything."
"Only they are confused as to where they stand ," observes Pelikán, adding that often patients lose their good humour when they are spending at least that they have generated.
The move to the hospital in an ambulance, and a bedroom for serious cost reaches patients thousands of kroner a dozen.
"I have often used as a means of teaching them a cost, though the visit saying directly to children how much he cost his intoxication and that they would have to spend the summer working in a youth ganaras to be paid enough for that night," adds Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in its opinion, perhaps, as a step backwards, usually to return it to the people that the cost of treatment, it does not do so in the case of children who are drinking.
L - 125 aircraft two are left outside for the first time in Spain.
L - two planes on a total of 159 for five, at which the Czech Ministry of Defense aircraft replaced the "Casa 295M, departed Tuesday for Seville, which is the manufacturer -- EADS Casa Aircraft.
Is the first time such a device has been in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the time being, only were abroad on flights or demonstration.
The L5 159T1 biplaza version, which has so far used the Czech army, and that it was still in state to fly.
The three remaining planes are the L monoplaza 159.
They are still kept in Aer Vodochody broker and the sales, corporation Omnipol, now took charge of them last week.
JAN Peješk of the press department of defence, said it was not yet known when they will physically Vodochody planes.
"Those airplanes monoplaza L5 159, instead, to repair planes were separated for some time, without investment and additional contributions by the Ministry. "
L1 159T1 biplaza 'is exchanged in its current state, "he said upon právo Pejšek.
The army added that aircraft are not left without biplaza, since May 2009, the Army has signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for $200 million for the construction of four devices biplazas L5 unnecessary to 159.
One new aircraft because it received the Army in July, the other to be delivered at the end of the year.
According Pejšek, EADS pledged that the planes will be added to the equipment in some allied countries.
"In the contract clearly indicated that EADS is the aircraft that dropped the L $159 and for practices that will serve as pilots for NATO countries.
"I, therefore, will depend on the buyer to decide how they are going to be used in this context, " notes Pejšek.
Hospodářské noviny published the newspaper before long, for example, than the Spanish army is not interested in the L5 159.
Sharing five L 159 for an aeroplane the House and three other purchasing aircraft by 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not convene a tender for the purchase price and be directly negotiated with EADS.
The current management of defence claims that promotes sharing future export the L5 159 abroad.
Czech army acquired for Aer 72 aircraft and only utilizes 24, by which it wants to sell the rest.
House purchase of aircraft possibly may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Ministry of Defence the Czech Republic in the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft made a European call for tenders, and does not contact a single manufacturer.
The army had already received and the last three aircraft the House should come of Kbely praguense at the airport in just 14 days.
Longer than an index finger indicates cancel the lowest risk of suffering from cancer.
Men who have the longest the cancel rate are subject to a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
That is the surprising finding of an examined published on Wednesday in a British journal, on cancer.
Could depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings suggest that the length of the finger on a simple test can create the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men over the age of 60 years," said the study's sponsor Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Consequently, her finger could help identify men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, particularly if this is linked to a feature or other damaging genetic risk factors, and family health problems, Eeles indicates.
During the period from 1994 to 2009, took up with a British counterpart over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, of 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had their fingers right hand Indica shorter than the reverse.
Had the same chance of getting cancer of the prostate that 19 per cent of those whose fingers are the same length.
In the case of the men, with a longer than the index fingers, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with a lower age to 60% reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, in the prenatal period, reflects various hormone levels to which it is exposed, the foetus in the womb.
A low testosterone level is in line with an index longer.
Previous studies have suggested that testosterone influence the development of prostate cancer.
Genetista the great Czech and former president of the National Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK who is familiar with the study but did not think that the relationship between the lengths of the fingers and the cancers it might "prove completely ."

Those shots can be programmed to not only beat who exploit when the goal but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
Can be used against the enemy that is hiding behind a barrier, a wall or in a trench.
Without doubt, it should not be used as a normal protection, and when rain sends its murderous metallic chips, could prove crucial in the battle.
Audette according to Richard, who spoke about the development from the XM / 25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon for one technology, which uses "smart."
"Those soldiers manipulated in a way that are the goal, at the same point the laser beam which determines the distance, after earning a point clear and, according to the same projection and corrects the line pulls the trigger."
"I say that have been measured of 543 metres. "
"Where it was pressing the trigger, the gun is loaded and launches the rocket at a distance of a metre (more than one, two or three feet," Audette says.
Move 400 jobs
Fujitsu consortium raises its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, more than 400 employees to change its workplace of their previous office buildings in Bad Homburg the platz Marienbader Astro Park.
Fujitsu, the Japanese consortium raises its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Reported as the giant of the industry, which specializes in computer maintenance and Wednesday, more than 400 men and women are being transferred in July of the following year in his former office building in Bad Homburg Marienbader Platz at the Astro Park, a massive office complex on the street in the Barrio Straße Lyoner of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
Fujitsu a spokeswoman explained that, in the medium term to over 100 employees by other consortium, which had previously been found scattered around the region, and will be housed there.
Supply is highly attractive, the office group Astro Park will benefit the way of work for their employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the sole tenant in Bad Homburg.
Manager Bernd Wagner said, "we have found - Niederrad Franfkurt in a central location with excellent infrastructure."
Bright the connection to the airport at the moment, is very important for a global corporation like Fujitsu.
The new removal of a major firm in the region sparked joy yesterday between those in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Economics section chief in Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that it has won a "Global Player."
This is a "wonderful recognition to the site."
Fujitsu is based in the city, is a settlement to Niederrad great momentum.
Bod Hombruger mayor, Michael Korwisi, green) deplores the decision from Fujitsu.
Leadership reported before in the city of their intention to do so.
"Of course, we have offered our assistance to the company," stated Korwisi.
However, the computer manufacturer's good relations with the owner of the property in Platz Marienbader have not been able to change the difficulties.
The end, the economic motives producieron the fall.
Way, there is now a great venue a vacuum to fill, in the famous seat.
"I hope that the landlord and the landlord of the building show cooperative."
Fujitsu previously used for the building in the Rathausplatz and neighbour 'Kleine Vertikale "sat with surplus buildings Marienbader Platz from 10 years ago in a controversial project to build the resort city.
As a joint project between the city and a private business projects between the station and the town hall was a new entry for the town, which had been responsible for the criticism on the massive building formerly used loopholes as parking spaces and in terms of the level of buildings.
Installed in 2001 have the investment counseling and adjusting firms, the software systems developer for reservations, Amadeus Start program, as well as then joined Siemens with the house computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building was developed by Fujitsu employed by the real estate group in Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Gruppe - alongside Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later, occurred in Spanish the Falcon Real Estate Investment Company in Madrid.
Fujitsu the consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global provider of IT.
Disposal of businesses, for example, computers and servers, and also provides services required.
Branch in Main / Gebiet Rhein and is one of the largest in Germany anyway more deals with Fujitsu in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is the affiliate installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt / Niederrad, the branches following Fujitsu Services will be at this point, and a firm with the TDS.
Why 7,000 square metres has been leased in the office building of Astro Park.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its level in the form of a star, to the association home among other electrical and central to the electronics industry.
Amazon closes the server - Threats against Assange
The anguish takes increasingly of Wikileaks.
Internet services provider The Amazon has removed the revelations of their server.
Probably behind it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, apparently being held in England.
Wikileaks revelations on the shelf is always a target for criticism, always strong in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to his earlier American server and now are seeking a homeland on the internet in Europe.
Known US senator, Joe Lieberman, who called for other countries to boycott of Wikileaks and businesses.
Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people wanted by Interpol, should be held in detention in Britain, according to one article.
"Wikileaks removed from the server of the Amazon."
Talk freely in the country of freedom ," revelations of the activists communicated by courier service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet firm, Amazon, had removed documents on Wikileaks from its server.
Internet activists had used in publishing diplomatic secret documents to the Web services Amazon to cope with the large number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks described as: "A perfect, and we will spend our dollars to employ people in Europe."
Whether Amazon had a problem with the right to freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped use his server by Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman have requested investigations, told CNN in a phone call to the room from Lieberman.
The presidency of the council of the senate to the security of the country, had threatened to boycott to Amazon, informed British the "Guardian ."
"I wanted to take those measures before Amazon before the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," declared the senator.
Lieberman also sought the platform also prohibit other countries the use of the name.
"The process illegal, inconsiderate and monstrous of Wikileaks is playing with our national security and the threat of living in the world," it said in a statement from the independent senator.
"No company responsible, either American or foreign, should assist to extend his service with the Wikileaks material stolen.
The founder of Wikileaks and Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, has been on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, "the Australian of 39 years has been arrested in Britain, Scotland Yard known the exact location.
Internet campaigner has consistently described the investigation in Sweden as a fabric of your enemy.
Wikileaks's spokeswoman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls on a Julian Assange a murder."
Why safety concern for the Assange, affirmed Hrafnsson.
Hence remains undisclosed location the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson reacted naturally before declarations of North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said the responsible of the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, said an adviser to the head of government of Stephen Harper, a clearly ironic, in television, Assange must "be killed" and Obama would "use the drone."
Assange between the White House and a great row grows.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, described as "ludicrous and stupid" as Assange has demanded the resignation of the secretary of state, where she will be responsible for directing recent diplomatic involvement in espionage.
"I am not quite sure why we should import the opinion of a type with a webpage," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy, and in the interests of this country are much stronger than their web page."
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of the safety of its databases generally.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the National Centre against terrorism, he was appointed as an exceptional charge, the White House announced.
Travers which is responsible for developing the "major structural reforms," which may be necessary in light of leaked Wikileaks.
The White House also want to inspect roads, as well as change the total information on the government and to protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to deal with the safety of the activists and dissidents should endanger the publication of the Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in contact with them," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary. "
University of scoops
"Gelato University" in Bologna heladeros prepare in the best times of the year.
Core the course of three days to go before the highest influx heladeros future and visitors from around the world.
In reality all the ice where it comes from?
Gelatiere gelataio and the.
Gelatiere the produces the cream all the rules of design art of Italian ice cream.
Espátula gelataio the draws with a desk of the ice cream, thus spreading barquillo and sells it on.
To tell you that, you do not need to go to, and Emilia dell Anzola in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more on ice cream should not visit "gelato University" Carpigiani, an Italian company.
Manufacturer equipped with scoops congeladora with the university in 2003, so that the cream of the scoops of their machines reaches the lofty ideals in all Italian parties.
Core the course of three days to go before the highest influx heladeros future and visitors from around the world.
There are also courses more of the most special days on the ice cream and chocolate heladería the practice of one " s own home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career path, other risks in the soft ice its vague desires.
This time there are 40 players from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil until Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of art, that of California, I am the slow movement of the food and into the future, he wants to give a European product quality industrial land of ice cream.
Anke, Berlin, is an adviser to business and to build something in the next few years working within an aggravating.
2 young Egyptians are dreaming of opening an heladería in Cairo.
Malta was a man and the other is Brazil want to improve the quality of his ice cream bars, a housewife and a Canadian, Julie, is to their sons because they love the Italian ice cream.
Luciano Ferrari heladero the teacher explained to participants then perfect scoops of ideal qualities.
Is critical not just its taste, but also to his gently sedosa and consistency.
Luciano has not forgotten her training nor cream of the deck of the house and national higher mainly in the south of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, which is why each ball is something romantic."
The first step in designing it seems all too easy.
Luciano misses the basic ingredient: Milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers batidora in a large, wide computer programme with a heated to 85 degrees and dampens the moment, up to four degrees.
Then opens the spigot of the core machine and pasteurised cream goes white, the basis for dealing with all types of milk ice cream.
Of a sudden, the professor asks: The cream scoops can be developed only with natural elements estabalizador or without?
How it can unleash some keen to experiment?
Luciano suggests' minds on the job that the trends of the era.
That scoops "and not just of natural ingredients," has been used to best stabilizing, primarily a natural product, probably guar gum, guar beans.
By icy course that can be prepared without stabilising, we need only buy one day, put in a bag and the audio a chilly customer morderá granite.
Will permit variations in the core estate.
Flavourings used.
On the taste of ice cream with the teacher the Luciano distinguishes between ingredients bought in the fruit or candy from the supermarket.
In addition, there was dust and pasta.
All suppliers' ingredients will be flavoured slip in his goods. "
"Nevertheless, should experience ever."
Sorbetes with either fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even cream scoops of basic white mass, that eggs and cream would be a yellow cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible joys of chocolate.
Now the course participants heladoras can use.
Luciano leaves them increasingly develop four distinct types of ice cream in vanilla, chocolate and hazelnuts Moca, with or without egg in the core estate, to a greater or lesser extent to the scent of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Perform the same experiment with different types of ice cream.
Who knows best is not necessarily to have more aroma of fruit puree tofe or more.
Does not need to know with hazelnut ice cream nut, if they contain more of hazelnuts.
The working group produces the worshipped scoops of kiwis, which uses more fruit, anything less and less water as a buffer.
Highlighted a balanced mix first taste of ice cream, said Luciano.
Producing ice cream artimética is a problem: The peach purée with a lot of sugar, which is the proportion of lower sugar to the basic recipe.
The lemon ice cream for the need for a portion of the extra sugar.
Luciano leverages a utensil that fix the amount of the types of the fruit sugar (measurement of winemaking for Oechsle the fresh grape must).
Tabulations fortunately easier the account.
Produce scoops it does not require the application rather than physical, as before.
Not only helps the automatic tool for the development of the core estate.
Also be a utensil, which beats back the icy mixture are ready and at temperatures below zero.
Despite everything, it was the entire automation was outside regarding small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo was blot himself and his comrades from the top down with fruit purée, as if it were a giant uncontrolled miniprimer.
"In every grade," says the schoolteacher Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a situation complicated.
Authority to the European food safety EFSA has crept in the industry which is experiencing with transgenic plants.
Currently formulating this Testbiotech the expert group, which is regarded as an institute for an independent evaluation of the impact in the field of biotechnology.
"I feel a conspiracy theory, but we were not well documented," said Christoph then, Testbiotech manager Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of a group of experts from EFSA on genetically modified plants and another expert from EFSA are also hired out in partnership Ilsi years ago.
Corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer for it.
Kuiper has collaborated in a meaningful way the rules for testing genetically modified plants from EFSA, which placed him in a clear conflict of interest, and then criticism.
EFSA's provisions are paragraphs to the same language in the documentation, and mimic Ilsi situation of the company, writing that in reality it is controlled by the Italian authorities at Parma.
Is the second time that a criticism Testbiotech collision of interests.
As well, most recently, a former senior manager of EFSA was without the support or the time for transition to Syngenta Agrarkonzern Swiss, and has changed his side.
Recently Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also showed personal connections between authorities inspecting the EU, and the industry, which made the Chief Environmental Officer, as well as illuminating an EU parliamentarian.
Nevertheless, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
Resort to all formal data, including some of the industry, as long as they are of a high quality technical and, ordering in a report.
There is no requirement for experts who worked with EFSA do not have any contact with the oil industry.
But must make these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
Itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among other risk assessment for biotechnology with the commissioning of the Lobby.
In this issue, experts, and then, have criticized that currently permit transgenic plants without investigating the food, for the animals and that they are not to check the impact of genetically modified crops on the environment.
"We want to know why, for example, genetically modified maize in agriculture," he said then.
The current practice is merely verifying proteinas isolated, but not as the transgenic plant, which offers reliable results.
"If risks not looking for it, how are you going to find that?," he asked, accusing, then.
Angelina Hilbeck believes in the same way.
Since 1994 to investigate the scientific field of genetic engineering and is currently working at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and in Europe, to influence or to discredit scientific critics.
Which is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by companies.
For companies, critical studies generally are not published.
"Industry research monitors of security, " maintains Hilbeck.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell has been some, in total around 400 pounds.
Monday, she was in front of the train station in Stuttgart, Tuba to the shoulders.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
History is known: Bulldozers moved in September and started demolishing a large piece of the north.
Stuttgart the land never again be the same: The thousands and thousands marched against s21, the stay at the station.
As he tagged, the greater part of the wing be hizó rubble.
Rotates at 6,000 and 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft stone Rugova, compiled between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell Ostfildern on is sculptor, is 43 years old.
Been ensured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Must not go."
Is overjoyed, "a touchstone, cheap and poor, simple and natural."
Once said as has olido smoke from cigarettes.
I still do not know what to do with the piece.
Stones have the time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trail of the stones from Stuttgart is a forest at Tubingen in a former munitions depot of the French navy, in which Manuel Rongen built his stone Stein and Reich.
Men with stones is 44 years old.
Has purchased all resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"I have dishonoured, molerían the gravels or sent to the dustbin," he said in his office, where a little wooden booth was once a prison guard.
I insulted and threatened, he said, when, in September, appeared in newspapers, that he had purchased the leftovers of the north wing of the demolitions.
The talk with enemies 21S of the last several days.
And explained that it could not do anything about the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was more reasonable, when stones were used.
Nearly 200 opponents of S21 mazizo 80 kilos were ruptured, with a price of $6.50 per share to €14.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope that they will be able to repay in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a charge of 25 trucks.
Around half are still in the bush, the rest a long time ago that was sold.
Garden owner of, a landscape gardener in charge of the project.
Came from all sides and what may be in the trunk and on top.
Stuttgart the stone's long drive that has become "the wall " and the delineation Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality, this stone is nothing special, " affirms Rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
Amounts to his SUV, a tour by its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
Studied law, interrupting her studies, and later teaching biology, he was interested in, and finally works with computers.
And is loving the stones.
Housed 4,000 tonnes of stone.
Their treasures shipped across Germany.
Dealer said to be the largest ancient stones of the country.
Slowing down.
Snow is artistic in the sandstone rocks, chopped.
"Dresden Marienbrücke Pertencieron the bridge," he explains.
Limestone dawn, turning yellow, very warm, it was exciting.
Stone "my dear. "
The road crosses the forest.
Notes a lot: The red sandstone, a piece of the former station in Karlsruhe.
And continues.
Travertino "nice."
Mazizos the formerly belonged to Stuttgart Neckarstadion the gallery.
Everywhere in the snow, and stones stories, travertino yellow head of the Stuttgart police, a red granite of the Sankt Blasien church, from Toba Heilbronner hospital.
What work, the effort, the sweat.
Rongen esculpió as in thought when the stones were moved and before with a gear and a simple cart, was very devout.
"It would be a scandal if anything be destroyed."
Rich has not been, all is immensely rich.
Today 14 people but gave the dealer to make stones, in Stone Masons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a gardener vidriero and have been installed at the top of the forest.
"We worked hard, but it is gratifying," says the man who is in charge to take advantage of the remains.
Shortly have to move to Cologne.
There are stones also to rescue.
Fight potential talent around great
The active Queen influx in the buffet.
16 students are accumulating about the biscuits, sweets and tomato soup.
Technical University of Braunschweig and Vokswagen car manufacturer have been invited to a workshop to the student of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of a competition of ideas, you have to talk about the car of the future with its VW workers and also learn everything over Volkswagen.
Competing, and in the same manner, many companies, including VW, are to meet in a duel some of the finest minds in collaboration with the universities.
Their mission: Recruiting as soon as possible to the most talented students from universities, before they enter the job market and be employed by others.
And universities did not provide material on the skills of its students, are trying to see with the exceptional talents captarlos and on practical projects.
The second day of the draft in the Technical University Braunscheig, the consortium they earn to the talent.
Miss one of the personnel department distributed pens, binders gomitas and the VW logo.
Explains to the excited young talent programs and practices the work for them and your roads shows students in the consortium.
Nico develop of the Technical University of Braunschweig is VW with the project.
Saw benefits to both sides: "Students are in touch with the industry, and gain experience."
"I in turn, educate students can VW, a closer look at the candidates and see them as an exciting potential future employees.
Some partnerships develop, he said, are not rare.
The novelty is that students are required so directly.
"The main point was in earlier technical projects," claims develop.
Fresh graduates fight for is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer pick and choose employees among a large pool of applicants.
If not that they have to be readvertised and, above all, in order to achieve a highly skilled workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent state of negotiations.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by their acronyms in German), in October there were 40,000 engineers positions vacant.
And of the VDI prognósticos, this gap in engineers will grow even more.
The company's auditing and advisory KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the hunt.
Runs costly recruitment events, as KPMG races, a kind of modern yincana, in which participants had to find its path through GPS coordinates.
Company wants to send eight promising students in the United States the following year.
Participants may also look at the branches of KPMG and learn more about the company.
Decides who must run in two rounds of the election.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants going to the US.
Universities are increasingly seeking to buff up and choose the high potential universities according Dykta.
"I want to highlight with the race."
"The journey alone simply, we fell short."
Dykta block headhunters from taking notes to the results.
"So today we have similar action in the last year, with all of the participants."
"Some are near their end, they want to claim, and to work with us," he says.
Further rapprochement live on campus, will also be hunting, especially small and medium enterprises, the fairs with his classic work.
'We are trying to get students in special exhibitions. "
Intersolar on "something ," asserts Sitha Stübe, responsible for personnel for the manufacturer of Solarworld solar technology.
Bonner, the company has about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe aware of the problem of the new generation.
Currently at the company's web page listed 35 seats.
"It is still very difficult to fill the vacant positions.
"Costs a great deal of time and money," he says.
A short path is the contact with teachers from the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several colleges, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Professors suggest that there may be practical with us, or to make their arguments.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
Why the company needs to be promoted with a number of other advantages: Friendly staff, comfortable flat hierarchy and communication.
"A large consortium may not normally offer," declares Stübe, in charge of personnel.
In the quest for a job, the more money is no longer the most important thing.
Those key factors are flexible working hours, helping children and a good chance for promotion.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld among the 55 square holds the 100 best employers.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best suppliers of German jobs.
To what the employee asked how happy you are to work with and the environment at the same notes and conditions of employees.
Stübe, also expects personal charge of an extra point in his classification by their applicants to work.
"I think the fact that the applicant is external ratings in particular a potential employer," he said.
Kriegler Reiner Wolf Employer Branding of Deutsche Akademie advises businesses that want a long term strategy which earn a good reputation as an employer.
Advised their clients more authenticity.
And that means, Kriegler, especially domestic measures.
"The best way to be as attractive employer happens with the employees," he said.
In the jargon of the industry, is called internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within his own staff.
"employees happy are the best ambassadors."
When it comes to the people and identify with what the company, then you get to the employer directly promoting from friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a game with bunch," said Kriegler.
Obama halted new drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico it has not emerged in recent years, no new oil drilling.
Washington government ban issued a forceful and overturned its previous plans an appeal.
Also to new drilling off the coast of the Atlantic remain closed for the time being.
Announced that the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
Causing this strict travel ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the bursting of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon " in April.
Before the accident that killed 11 workers and caused the largest US environmental catastrophe, President Barack Obama had admitted to new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and from the industry.
Supporters wanted as well reduce the US dependence on foreign oil supplies further.
Until now has not been entirely clear on who is responsible of the irretrievable oil slick in the Gulf.
In the center is critical of British energy group BP, it is faced with the demands of millions.
Commissioned by a committee of inquiry, Obama will present its findings in December.
October in, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, he lifted a drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently peteroleros different consortia submitted applications for new attempts.
Salazar and Barack Obama want to set aside a new catastrophe with tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
Currently the authority responsible, having been accused of charges of corruption, has fallen into disrepute, is root and branch reform.
Obama said on the margins of tax loopholes that would be closed for the consortiums of lucrative oil and gas.
Industry, announced that the total production in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, so far.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on growth of the oil and gas industries," said the outcome of the current opinion poll conducted by the firm advises BDO - before the mining ban on Wednesday.
The Alliance complains the Energey uncertainty in the sector: "Nobody knows what change exactly with regulation."
Investment in new mining projects was extended by one, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
Water rivers is márrón oil smells like a gas station: Millions of litres have destroyed oil spills in Nigeria's Ogoniland nature.
People living the theft, corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
Celestine Akpobari seems to be well.
"You not canséis," reassured by the environmental activist for journalists: "These will pass enough oil to your eyes."
The Nigerian has been 37 years to photograph male by wading across into the water up to his chest in the glow of lights reflected Turbulence in the area: The sparkle of the water with its colourful, the scene seems almost empty.
I do not see it float on the surface of the brown dirt of oil.
Caught prawns to handfuls here before, said Esther Badom in the Jetty Bodo - bank of the river.
Long, flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago dumped in the Shadegan formidable an impressive amount of oil by a broken pipe.
Fish from the outskirts of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours in water full of fish: That, at the heart of the Niger Delta and in Ogoniland, is regarded as one of the world's farthest apestadas.
On the path of the river that passes by mangroves, the extensive destruction was obvious.
Water instead of clear, the engine of the boat will renew a brown broth, submerge him sticking his hand into the water, filled with oil a lift.
Raices the mangrove trees rising from the ground, such as swinging sticks regaliz, sadly aislan palms that collide, and hung their palms.
Seeking in vain, flocks of birds, as if in the wetland as always: As it keeps quiet outside the barrier, it expands a sort of ghostly calm of a paradise with a smell of petrol.
"What happens here is a struggle the green ," asserts huraño, Celestine Akpobari. " We live in constant danger to public health. "
Comparison the war.
The Ogoni area of the settlement of the conflict is a battleground for years: Broken here more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers, we convened the first resistance in the 1980s and the writer Ken Saro Wiwa was later executed, had put its first factory that the consortium of Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for use by employees of the oil.
Nowadays are forbidden even return companies in Ogoniland: Bombeaban daily, while more than two million barrels of the black gold to the whole of the delta region, more than three times the size of Switzerland, with more mining sources 5,000 and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, oil fields in Ogoniland were comfortable, the location was too unstable for the consortium.
Platforms sobresalían 200 metres every steel water sculptures as bizarre: "Christmas Arbolitos" affectionately called the head of the project.
Face up to 50 years old, the majority with a corrosion.
Failure each moment a head believed Akpobari, then, there is a steady stream of oil in the water.
Valuations as experts, have been dumped more than two billion litres in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the volume of oil it penetrates, as ship averia "Exxon Valdez," 21 years ago, the seas of Alaska, one of the greatest catastrophes ecólogicas in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the enduring region environmental lidiará with this.
While the consortium of Shell and the organized theft of petroleum were responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, the environmentalists are to the head in the process of breaking up and the leaking pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell uses mainly low standards of security normally the world's conventional, he reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008 - only the defective pipes rates are "on a multiple more than any other place."
In one location, from afar seems to have forgotten is a workshop filled with oil under the heavens free, are figureheads of mangroves are naked and covered with oil.
Among many one of the barrels, that are sometimes attached to those holes, sometimes arbitrarily strewn on the ground, firing flamea one: A small refinery.
In a barrel, oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explained Michael, the head of the group.
First gasoline cuts through the pipes into the receptacle, the pipes later dripping finalemente leave oil and diesel.
Thus Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel daily of 300 litres, "we bring 34,000 naira ," around 22 million.
Delta residents take advantage of the fuel shortages in one of the greatest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria only refineria with a single.
Cheap stupid, and with the price of the diesel for as little as 40 euros per litre - penny illegally heaters can offer even less: They reduce the amount of raw materials.
Comes "out of the bunkers," which the network of pipes trucaron in Ogoniland, according to experts, this step is to lose at least 16 million gallons of oil a day over the entire Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional bonus material stored illegally clear day be: Organised criminal networks, who also belong to the political and military leadership, they are the best side in cisterns and sell it cheap on the world market.
Akpobari activist considered purely academic debate on whether the environmental catastrophe was due rather to the management of the population or in the loose way to production.
"If the oil companies are not behaving as invasive and not yet completely destroyed the natural habitats of fish, should not sabotage or theft, or illegal refinerias."
While conditions of the Ogoni People are torn apart especially for Shell to the extent that only one consortium of deduction: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese. "
Michael is getting nervous.
"It is now time that desaparezcáis " explains musculoso Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come at any minute."

Thousands of people mourning for miners killed
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people may have thought in miners buried, after many had died in a mine explosion.
Todavia have been unable to find the bodies, because security measures remained precarious at the scene of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago, there was an intense explosion at the mine near the Pike River town of Greymouth.
29 miners, aged 17 and 62 years, were buried in the mine.
There was a probe into the mishap, but did not find any indication of survival.
Due to a high concentration of toxic gas and a series of explosions - no rescue team was able to come down for security reasons.
After the intense second detonation, authorities and experts argued that there was no chance that the miners had survived.

Photographs and personal belongings was also underneath clothing and surfing boards.
Flags flew at half mast on government buildings in the country.

Have been learned in terms of explosive gases, the temperature inside the mine burning will begin to decline, he told Gary Knowles, the commander of the police, and journalists.
So Al devil, warrior!
Will Gore film fits into the arts?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is to explore the boundaries of the genre with its epic battles " Walhalla Rising. "
What will the audience thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn rolling "Walhalla Rising "?
A warrior vikingo prisoner with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) were freed of their tormenters and assassinates its enemies with almost an entirely superhuman one struggles, this sounds ideal for young viewers seeking bloody action, that is precisely because our hero, likes to use brutal methods to kill and drive their enemies the gut their bodies alive when they are in a bad mood.
Alternatively - Unojo, as it is called, in fact, does not say a word for almost the entire film and the other characters are left to carry on as much one or two sentences a couple of painful screams or fatalities.
Otherwise remained silent and enjoy beautiful and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, that the scenes offering vikingo of the world for about 1,000 years.
Ideal rather older and interested for filmmakers existencialismo in the chamber and in the movements quite calmly.
When a film has several audiences is a penalty that could not be ruled out against each other.
Refn Winding the director finds to their wild and the trilogy on a hair drug smuggler "Pusher" as some sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but staunchly refuses to make their works are for all audiences, with a little more humor into the mainstream or something less brutality artistic home.
A brain and a gut that blossoms cannot deter the majority of supporters of artistic cinema.
The majority of fan of action they die of boredom if Jerusalem Unojo buys a boat with a group of missionaries cristioneros interpretable motivated violence and an eternity, is confining and fog in the calm before their team reaches America to shut up and get back in there.
Is a pity " Walhalla Rising "is not found alone cinema distributor in Germany and will be released on DVD.
Is a calamity against the fantastic images, but also because, in the wake of bloody and boastful facade hides a piece of film, sometimes exciting, that deserves some attention.
This movie is not an action of dialogues or logic, there is an atmosphere, a fevered dream turned into film.
And for that there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn condede is barely a moment of relaxation and their glaciers and the sombre image of him descending soundtrack a noose around her neck, and on all the incredible hatred, that hearts of the characters went towards him.
Just a small blonde girl, that supports Unojo faithfully retains something as innocent, all the others are moved by rage.
Especially, a hero of one eye, but did not explain the reasons he never becomes a warrior anytime for hell out of the enemy and its allies, possibly in the ambassador in the same plane.
Represents the Doom, but perhaps only for those who have been lost anyway.
Walhalla "Rising " is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire so distressed, excited and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements land
IAEA nuclear energy organization has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue to allow checks.
On the average night of 5 and 6 September 2007, when Israeli jets least four warplanes attacked I F � 15 cubic a mysterious building in Syria.
Be located on the bank of the Euphrates, the largest city nearby and 30 km / Saur Dair as is.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is apparently on a Syrian reactor built with the aid of North Korea, in the tub, in a hidden valley is the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service the CIA in late April of 2008, it is a reactor design flow under the name Al Kibar near highly appropriate for the production of plutonium, which could be used to build nuclear weapons.
In contrast, only used for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA gave a video presentation of satellite imagery become blurred.
Shown a computer animation were where components before the reactor's destruction, to be a model of small copies of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear plant.
Taught also photographs that showed the building in the vicinity or inside the country.
Recently that the reactor was in operation, he said, but is not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later in the day of the bombing, it is only known that the then, riddles were increased with time.
The previous US president, George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA is totally safe that the Syrians had built a reactor at Al Kibar, but found little evidence that the country was "a nuclear weapons program."
In Europe, a number of secret service agents would prefer to be more cautious and it is only about an "alleged reactor, " but believed" plausible " presentation for the CIA.
Lacked solid evidence, as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency.
When asked how sure he was taken ahead a reactor, a senior UN diplomat responded during the summer so the coup de grace that the IAEA "has sufficient material to take questions."
Syrians unraveled quickly from the rubble of an alleged "crippled military building" and paved the way.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA, under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen rastos found uranium to the Kibar, which had been produced by people.
Furthermore, the International Atomic Energy Agency obtained satellite imagery on a member state, commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, it must have a value that the more information provided by the CIA.
However, these photographs were never on the market because a customer unknown, perhaps, Israel bought the exclusive.
IAEA therefore could not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a nuclear weapons program in secret and built no nuclear reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
IAEA dismissed as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Damaskus since refused to discuss the issue, in the same way, with respect to the satellite images.
In addition, the inspectors are allowed a second inspection of the Al Kibar and entrance to the ruins of the building that was struck.
Israel is also a strict silence.
"Never do we will, " Ehud Olmert, prime minister, in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
As well as the investigation of the case had not shown results from June 2008 and is gradually transforming a major credibility problem for the authorities, "as one Western diplomat from high office is a place on the IAEA in Vienna, finally remaining is a serious offence against the treaty against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the monitors.
IAEA finds three more teams as the key to progress in the investigation, which should be "the functional connections " to the alleged reactor, and others like them still exist.
Those inspectors have not been publicly disclosed until now of what teams are covered, and what duties they have, or if they appear to be suspicious.
Süddeutschen Zeitung, the newspaper, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been designated as the Senate and internal Marj Sultan, the Masyaf Iskandariayah and again from near the towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) in Washington, D.C. identified these locations and tracked a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the satellite imagery that is very likely to be one of those suspicious objects.
Immediately possibly is in or next to a military base), Syria with bans entry to the three sites to the IAEA.
Vienna said that the Syrians feared a search that the US has requested that the military spy IAEA for plants.
Nuclear alert detectives were on the team thanks to the demands of the secret service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA had evidence of moving material from three locations and the bucket to the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "connected to the production of fuel."
But "there is no evidence of significant activities" or uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
Actuated is the type of reactor that is not enriched uranium.
Where the uranium should go and where it is then separated plutonium for bombs, to these central questions are, at best, provide plausible assumptions.
There are also doubts if the ruins, the valuable clues that can recovered, were found in three places.
As disappeared the hundreds of cargo trucks on the ground, there is no information on where to stay beneath the rubble.
OIAE the salt mine is unlikely the al- Tibni, situated within the few kilometres to the Kibar from the other party to the Euphrates, which the Syrians acknowledged in 1998 by its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked to the reactor on an analysis of satellite imagery to the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the pictures from orbit to show the Syrians they land movements suspected sites in three cases and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
May be coincidence but it barely helps to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic field said that the IAEA had spent a few months to develop a plan for inspections, which the Syrians would, to keep the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the extent of the interest of the investigators.
Meanwhile, also criticises Damaskus this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago it reassured that the reactor already was destroyed, so the issue has no great urgency, since a couple of months ago; Glyn Davies, a US ambassador called inspections is exceptional - one of the most rigorous nuclear authorities vienesas have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, which must propose those inspections, has spoken of "an option which I remain open in the future," but it still balks.
This way is very risky, this will require the majority of the board of governor of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and some of the 35 countries represented are not exactly desperate for an escalation.
Moreover, as reflected diplomatic: "So what happens if in the end they did not find anything"?
The love in the times of war
Problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the management of his debut yet to name.
Herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not know much more about it, but this is not enough, for the unrest.
The rumour is very persistent, women, Muslim, her Serb rapist in love with during the war in former Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's groups quickly protested, which came at the last moment a few days of filming were planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The movie was filmed in Hungary and in post-manufacturing but still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims the war wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Is not diplomatic, weeks women offered a meeting in Hungary which was rejected.
The event took place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories are not in the camps to rape, and the position of Jolie on victims reveals enough on the script.
Their organization agreed with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissal to Jolie as ambassador, according to the Guardian.
But what exactly has written what Jolie the scenes?
Bosniac culture ministry that he read the script, a tug after it granted permission in Sarajevo, it was not altogether clear why Jolie was not in spite of it all.
She reiterates that the youngster has no political aims with his movie, introduced with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show that the horrific consequences of the war, and giving voice to all parties involved.
Their content remains vague.
Riding a second network in a synopsis of the film, which sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the start of the war and when she relapsed, a Bosnian Muslim, Serb, is deported to a camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different variant is "a victim of a rape perpetrator was in love with."
Is no doubt that the film really begins, Jolie before the war.
Pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and is based on erroneous information."
Are now able to achieve peace with the hackers of Hollywood, while the script is still the network illegally, as many others before.
Nothing as far away from here.
So again this afternoon to be good for the Irish.

The democratic routine
Is increasing support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the backing for private companies.
Crime generates greater concern that unemployment.
In addition, much of the region, is in Brazil as the most influential country for the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allows us to monitor the changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of the survey this year, which was carried out in September and early October, are two issues.
The first is relatively lively humor the situation in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen significantly in different countries from the Pacific coast of South America (see chart 1).
E.g. in Peru, where economic growth has risen to an average of 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 percent in 2005, to 61% this year.
Also grew in Mexico City, where the economy has been recovering after suffering a sharp decline in production over the past year.
However, just half of those polled in both Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populated countries in the zone, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Around 44 percent of those polled across the region are satisfied with the way democracy works in their country, the same number as last year, but significantly higher than the 25 percent reported in 2001 (Figure 3).
Approximately 34 per cent said that they were confident the Congress and the other 45% of the country in his government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but it is considerably higher compared with 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, with economic turbulence hit the support for Latin American democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained over the global financial crisis is likely to be due to the fact that many countries in Latin America are affected only a brief recession and had enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, said this week that the number of Americans living in poverty only rise marginally in 2009 and which has been cut again this year, up 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Good economic returns from Brazil, and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, it is a reflection of a general sense of achievement.
That sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more serious and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the survey began, with more respondents cited crime in Latin America instead of unemployment as the biggest problem facing the country (see chart 5).
Around 31 per cent said that they or a close relative has been a victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has dropped from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest figure since 1995.
Most positive economic returns reflected in increased support for private enterprise and market economics: Some 71 per cent of those polled in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable to the development, while in 2007 was only 56% (see chart 6).
Around 58% agreed that a market economy is the only system that will enable the country develops, compared to 47 per cent last year.
Interesting is that 62 percent of those surveyed in Venezuela they feel the same way (and is 80 per cent to the private companies) but their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is being expropriated many private companies.
Brazil is the only country exercising greater leadership in the region, such as the 19 percent of respondents, compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States - or 9 per cent, the same figure as last year), and Venezuela (9 per cent, compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country that is considered the most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, and boasts such title in Venezuela, Ecuador, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.
Elections to garbage
Nobody expected that the general elections held in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
However, it took much less than feared that foreigners are trying to help the country climb after their problems.
Votes at the ballot box was introduced, some people voted several times, publications in the sewers ballots, polling stations, destroyed and acts of intimidation.
With the polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including people displaced by the earthquake in January, a move over the area trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, they complained of fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, were spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the official most senior United Nations in Haiti, said that they were "fairly good elections in many ways. "
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that "we do not believe that these problems, from severe they are, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents is committed with René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and her candidate, Jude Célestin should announce preliminary results on December 7.
Is expected that the runoff be held in January.
Have not yet lost all hope in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly a rapero, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, had withdrawn her initial request calling for the cancellation of the vote.
Yet problems could arise if the electoral authority said that the Mr. Célestin, who has almost no support, if it has one, has moved to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the cholera epidemic is ravaging the country, and more than a million survivors of the earthquake are still living in tents, was hoping for a large turnout.
Eventually many Haitians wanted to vote, but did not do so because of a lack of organisation.
Around 250,000 new identity documents needed to vote, had not yet been circulated shortly before the elections.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a government of the people and is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been made clear, so they think Haitians themselves.
Moving tiptoeing towards the centre
In the weeks that have elapsed since lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, Argentine president, has enjoyed a great deal of sympathy from the public, which has grown in popularity 20 index points, to more than 50 per cent, the highest level it has been since his election in 2007.
Despite everything, that might make it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend clearly affected if Mrs Fernández inattentive to the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was taking charge of economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of budgeting infravaloraban that tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the presidential wedding extra income to spend at her discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs Fernandez lost her majority in Congress in the past year.
However, the opposition was divided, a situation that has worsened in the wake of the death of Kirchner as a result of a heart attack on October 27.
Peronist movement of certain dissenting members in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session where somebody punched him in the face and another to other MPs accused the government of deceit, the Congress to reject the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," said the president.
The 2010 budget, as a result, will be applied to the next year, which will offer the president an even greater leeway to spend it.
Economy is improving considerably, is likely to grow up to 9 per cent this year.
The official rate of inflation is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the salary demands of the trade unions, are about 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was on the brink of economic meltdown, made economic growth and poverty reduction were priorities, instead of controlling inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, which put pressure on the private sector and the INDEC, as the statistics institute, followed the official inflation statistics.
Fernandez now the president will do these policies?
Has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
In addition, officials say that they want to limit wage rises over the next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high prices for agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has been limited with the boost to growth achieved a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, perhaps Ms Fernández is giving signs of trying to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government came to an agreement with bondholders that had been denied to a forced restructuring of the debt Argentina had not paid in 2001.
In the moment, it appears that Ms Fernández is on the verge of signing an agreement with creditor governments under the Paris Club, to be about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as usual.
However, last month, Amado Boudou, the Finance Minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance " to set up a new Consumer Price Index (CPI), which appears to be a prelude for the cleaners of INDEC.
It was not clear whether the President Fernández wants to stay in politics, when it ends its mandate, given that her husband no longer has by his side.
If it does, it will need to win the support of the middle class, many of whom have been tired kirchnerismo of.
When Argentines return in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy for him to be dropped.
If he wants to win another election, it will have to decide whether or not to reject with calmly, many of the policies her husband.
China means hurra
Taiwanese voters are approaching a kind of union closer to the continent.
What is Taiwan on his big brother side of the close?
Over 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, had flocked on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying jeou Democrats.
Mr Ma has been a proponent of those sentiments with the continent, generating innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, the largest changes in its relationship with China since 1949.
Mr Ma was the test, but for a little.
Although his ruling Kuomintang (KMT), winning three of the five elections in the town hall failed to win a majority of the votes.
In its place, the progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has been tipped by full independence by Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all the votes cast compared to 45% for the KMT.
If would have been the presidential election, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, with the KMT empató PPD in the halls.
Elections were seen the typical features Taiwanese elections, including noisy trucks and large gatherings with scantily dressed girls banderitas and dancing.
Mysterious nor lacked rigour of attempted murder.
Lien are, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, is campaigning for one of the candidates from the KMT, the night before the election.
One man from the crowd shot the young woman directly in the face, killing one bystander and wounded him.
What is interesting is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm him to retaliate, Lien or the candidate.
In any event, Mr. Tsai says Ing - Wen, leader of the PDP, the gunfire hit the election to sow on PPD and prompting suspicion that voters inclinasen by the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was to China.
It was surprising that he was not trying the case on the continent itself.
In their place, the candidates talked of plans of public accommodation and job creation.
Taiwan generally enjoys de facto independence, and he hates the military threat from China.
Accordingly, the KMT is avoid giving publicity to its ties with the government in Beijing.
But the PPD avoided this time also encouraged sentiment against China.
Addresses the new awareness that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For their part, Mr Ma said that he had confirmed that its policy with regard to China, was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
Expected that the government in Beijing to continue sobornándoles to trade, in line with its strategy to bringing Taiwan back to the fold.
China lost no time to send a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit, on the protection and investment cooperation.
Without a doubt, I would get further political integration, but first things first.
It would be better to wait until after the presidential elections of 2012.
In any case, the DPP has been reinvented.
Two years ago was in a very bad situation: His old leader, Chen Shuibian was jailed on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, the instigating independence openly.
However, under the leadership of Diana Mr. Tsai has emerged a new generation and the moderates of PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Mr. Tsai has been embraced warmly as a PDP candidate for the presidency, like Tseng His and chang, who met under Chen.
Now his party is to do everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Mr. Tsai had announced plans for the creation of a panel of experts who act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that they could be conducted negotiations without preconditions.
Mr. Tsai says the lady the Taiwanese public that his party represents a "credible alternative " to the precipitous approach of Mr Ma, with regard to China.
Mr Chen appeared to rage by the change.
In a statement issued from his prison cell, stated that the DPP's candidate had gone better off, if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, which did not report to the president.
Intervene even without Mr Chen, PPD will find it difficult to choose between prospective candidates.
The KMT should also do an examination of conscience.
Valuations of Mr Ma had been poor, despite impressive economic growth, and the KMT candidate have not wished to campaign with him.
Lack of popularity appears to be chiefly due to unemployment and the growing gap between the rich and poor.
KMT a spokesman says that will formalize his cabinet, as well as their local teams.
Large samples suggest that PPD support of Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "has already been crossed the point of no return."
Grammy nominations to the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice at Artist category of the revelation.
Acting at the request of a chairman and perhaps people will be set in You.
Expectation Spalding, the jazz singer and falling 26 years selected personally by President Obama to act in his Nobel prize ceremony in 2009, one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination in the category for Best Artist Discovery.
Spalding taking into consideration that he has been a figure of the acclaimed jazz from his 2008 album, "Esperanza, " the nomination gives what to think, but it does respect the rules whereby the Grammys should be an artist, who has not lifted the market more of the three albums before recording" establishes the public identity of that artist. "
Their ambitious album of 2010, " Chamber Music Society, "undoubtedly a breakthrough and, in light of its vocal style light and pleasant, with great skill as well as a pop influence, funk and Latin rhythms, it can, at least, differentiate between Spalding and a path to success by Norah Jones in 2003, which is the nearest equivalent to the Grammys, the voters, who recently have focused on field of jazz for this category.
In other categories of the Grammy voters were rightly honour "Historicity ," Vijay Iyer is a wonderful and exciting to drive, that was one of the favourites for the last year.
Among the competitors are veteran saxofonista Iyer is the James Moody through "Moody 4B" and John Beasley teclista "Positootly. "
Trombone Shorty, a favourite in gaudy and regular guest in New Orleans' Treme, " on HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, which is tilted considerably the rest towards fusion albums as Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Mr. Jeff Lorber.
Wild the affiliated of Darcy James argue's Secret Society won a special recognition in the category of larger groups, competing against the big house of Jazz Ensemble and the Billy Childs provided risky Dave Holland, whose album with its in vivo octeto "pathways ," was a great example of the declining of democratic leadership in his band.

Temecula in the mosque proposal gets the approval of the commission management
The proposed mosque to Temecula had the unanimous support of the local planning commission, after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the bill, saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the committee, decided on Wednesday night to ensure that the new law respects the religious centre is local and impressive at the aesthetic.
"Many good people who came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha'is of all religions," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic centre of Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud of."
Shows that justice prevails ."
"Opposition is really minimal," he adds.
Speak only "very high ."
Valley, there are people in this "beautiful."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was spent on people who would intercede in favour or against the centre, almost the same amount in every hand, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"USA is no longer there," read one of the comments.
"Planet of the Apes with another, the lady dead Liberty in the sand ."

Would surface acre 4,32 a Nicholas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Those opponents can still turn the project to the city council.
Arsenic raises a bug resistant to the possibility of new forms of life on Earth, or other places...
The strange discovery of a bacteria that can use arsenic as one their nutrients expands the possibility of new forms of life on Earth, and possibly on other planets.
While the researchers had discovered the strange bacteria here on Earth, say it shows that it is possible to have without the main ways of life that they considered essential elements.
"This body has a dual capability."
"Can grow to be arsenic or phosphorus.
"That makes her something very funny, although not required to be a kind of lifestyle really 'alienígena'," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, author of the report, which appears in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Since some time ago, it is considered that there are six major components are essential for life: Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, could keep expanding after substituting the phosphorous by arsenic.
"Te plantearte what is more is possible," said J. D.) Ariel Anbar of Arizona State University, author of the report.
Anbar, as noted, the discovery is important in the search for life on planets of Earth, given that researchers need to recognize life, know that is the point.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, calling a press conference to discuss the matter, which was not broadcast details of their discovery produced a vast Internet speculation about the possibility of the report provide the outer life of discovery.
Did not.
What the discovery "it shows is that in other environments, it could have other elements using agencies to spur their biochemistry and all the elements that" standard " that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed, "commented Charles Cockell, professor of planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute), the Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrated the replacement of one element by another in the biochemistry and the structure of the underlying biochemistry," chirped Cockell.
The discovery was not by accident.
Felisa Wolfe - Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which conducted the study, which focused at the Mono Lake because it contains high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorous are similar in chemical terms, which speculated that a microbe could replace both exposed to each other.
"The toxic arsenic is mainly because its chemical performance is similar to that of a ship."
"Consequently, it can be complicated to the agencies differentiate them.
"However, the arsenic is sufficiently different as not to work as well as phosphorus, and therefore falls, and so somehow squeezed the biochemical machinery," said Anbar.
The researchers took bacteria GFAJ known as 1 and explained to the growing concentrations of arsenic, which managed to be adapted and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorous, but the fact that it can live show arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be natural a way of life that use arsenic, whether at other areas of the Earth, or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, noted that the idea of being able to replace the wax by arsenic is not new, but had never been an example to show that it works.
The arsenic was most common early in the eras of the Earth, he said, the researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have been used.
"Yes that it suggests that there might be other means to generate living, not only the way in which life was formed under the Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe - Simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.

PEEK and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city to the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach at the weekend and had planned to wear at Trace.
The other dog went to the exhibit in other competitions are planned in the days preceding the AKC / Eukanuba championship, according to the The Times in PEEK Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for nearly two months by the canine couple engaged in competitions.
On Monday evening, and Rickard PEEK made the check in the motel.
Normally stay at motels and park his truck in front of the window of his room.
Carried other herding three dogs (a boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them at the motel room.
Akitas but left the Corgis and in the van because it had a very thick stripe and would be more fresh.

Lion rugir is ready to once again, while restructuring GMMs gets final approval from the U.N.
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty GMMs has finally been given the green light for a new beginning.
Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York approved a formal plan " INADVERTENT prearming "by creditors to delete approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the entertainment company from 86 years focus its efforts on the the production and release of films and television programmes.
Thursday's ruling confirmed that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so that there were no legal obstacles to be relaunched GMMs under founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executive of a small study.
400 staff will be reduced from approximately $320 to members.
In reality, not to come out of Chapter 11 GMMs that JPMorgan Chase until a credit instrument shutdown planned 500 million, to fund operations and new productions GMMs.
The investment bank now sindicando credit, which is helping on its own with a $75 million, and it is expected to be funded in the middle of December.
The process of restructuring the survey began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management needed to manage their finances, while struggling to make interest payments by $300 million a year.
During the month of August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former Enron chairman and was an expert in business recovery in bankruptcy, known for his work in the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to deal with the travails GMMs financial and to meet with the study's more than 140 creditors, took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, to the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted a few bidders and none is willing to pay more than $2 billion that secured creditors were seeking.
Before this spring, returned to the drawing board, while the equipment of GMMs began work on a plan of restructuring that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, as was eventually backed up by creditors at the end of October.
GMMs when formally emerge from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive bonuses of millions of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received a $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper of companies, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their services to the administration of the company, will receive a "success fee " of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at GMMs, which released only one film this year and collected an annual eight slate seven films to be released in 2012.
Financing also make two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The study requires entering a separate borrowing between 265 and 275 million to fund its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of the outstanding debt of GMMs, had been trying to resolve a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the latest talks between the two companies were not in agreement.
Toys Tech want to maintain the balance its budget for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the plaything more wonderful this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect games system, both can make a significant dent in its budget for gifts.
Considered for the price of an iPad you can buy five bicycles each BMX for $99, and Kinect a game that costs the same 10 classic attraction of jump rope, or approximately 48 cans - the Play Doh.
But there are ways of keeping its budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal Mart �, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, for viewing by electronic toys that could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; technological toys this year is likely to have more power, costing the same or even a bit less, compared with the last year.
Moreover, as long as there are usually fewer toys new partner websites, two of the best known of this sort, Webkinz and Club Penguin are more tender.
Toy and button battery driven are on the rise, as well as toys, with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.

Promotes a more moderate side of policing China
Urban as a sergeant instructor Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a square in the town with him, harshly with the nervous their dependants, issuing orders in a voice low under military authority.
Him wanted female members in Chengguan, corpulentos policemen of the Chinese urban order, despised and feared for their capricious crackdown and his inclination towards violence, and to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Steadfast!"
"Attention!"
¡muéstrenles, susurró, "how are nice girls!"
Four teenage girls that barely passed with white gloves and olive green jackets and tight jeans identical to draw attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four stylish hats placed perfectly beyond the hair teased moños with striped blue and white.
"I personally think we had a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, denigrate.
"Models are nice. "
More of a government has tried to clean up the image of the city inspectors to China.
City ordered that all new recruits should have a bachelor's degree.
Guangdong Province was appalling the green colour of the uniforms to blue in a supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, was replaced, the use of force by the intimidating gaze: In 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded an unruly cart snacks, and they observed few eyebrows were raised with the continuously for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up their things and left.
Xindu, an urban district's 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen to take a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the District has added to its urban police 13 women, specifically chosen by their appearance, and the proportion of young people.
The idea is to give the police a more mild rough side, feminine.
Unfortunately, to Scarlett Johansson have to fight to build tiny Chinese respect to these squads of the city.
And for good reason, and would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, those officers are authorized only to enforce the city's ordinances, imposing fines and other penalties.
But the Chinese news media are routinely portrayed a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of Hubei Province was killed by a bystander hitting after having used his dissolved filmarlos while cell for a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, inspectors for a training manual out of Beijing was stolen and posted on the internet, which was described as a hit without criminals effectively to make them bleed.
This year, travelling a watermelon seller in Shanghai suffered brain damage following a fracas with five officers.
A full video game violence, will be available to download online, presents trained inspectors by the Chinese who prey on street vendors.
Chengguan "has left a scar on the government," it lamented China Daily, a national publication, in the past year, followed by another dispute over tactics.
The newspaper claimed "a really thorough cleansing."
Those sceptics argue that the current approach is far from that.
After the district sought via eight new female recruits a notice in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, was asked whether security duties had women and theatre were merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The notice asked District women from 18 to 22 years old with a good figure " and a balanced facial features the five. "
Must have a height above average, higher to 1.6 meters, or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26, it is compulsory.
Officials said that the work was too physically arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"Your perception is the important thing," he said a nameless Rednet.com to district official, a quasi government Web site.
"First, the quality of external candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight and facial features, etc."
The temperament then comes " and inner qualities ."
Chengguan are female as the vases, he said, adding, " besides where vases have other responsibilities. "
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the bureau of administration for the city in the district, is not eager to back that description.
But noted that the demands were altitude standards in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the need for balanced facial features.
I bet if this is meant to be, it is a matter for debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not stand.
"We cannot allow a person or a hobbled jorobado come to work here," said Mr Zheng.
'Their image is not right. "
Liu Yi, who patrol Baoguang Square near a monastery, has 22 years old, and their cheeks with a subtly curved lips want.
She did not believe that an emphasis on its appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think that with this hobby sexy uniform?" Enquired sardónica with a gaze.
With his workmate hoyuelos, Xu Yang, 21, said: "Our job should submit the image of the city."
They do not oppose their work at the time, they said, because they have the greatest career ambitions that simply scare traders into the alleys where they are supposed to be limited to its business.
Each morning, the death squad is more or less to a dozen vendors who hunt on foot or by bicycle, to try to sell too many biscuits or bowls tofú as possible before being evicted.
"Mr. Wang, had to leave."
"I have said it many times! " said the lady while Xu a seller he escaped on foot, leaving his bicycle cart pulled temporarily at garrison with noodles.
Officers described her duties as the more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in their free time.
"very routine ."
Officers is a reason women do not have the power to confiscate their male counterparts, the sellers of the goods.

Prosecutors lifted no charges against Senator Ensign
Announced the senator's lawyers Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors had cleared to Senator John Ensign of the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign aide and their efforts to ensure workplace through lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends a legal threat to the more serious facing Ensign, Republican of Nevada, who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair on national headlines was bruised last year and his career.
Ensign's office said that he was "certainly satisfied" by the decision, which came following an investigation of an entire year.
The Senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign said that lawyers in the Justice Department had "reported that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of the investigation and that there is no plan to lift charges against him because of this issue ."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many outside ethics lawyers in the Justice Department, which said that there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate Ensign might have conspired to violate a criminal prohibition on federal lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were shared at the outset in October 2009 at the New York Times reported that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to securing lucrative jobs through lobby, to ensure the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, the senator's affair with her.
Mrs Hampton once worked as treasurer of Ensign a campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work to Mr Hampton and advocated on their behalf since they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Hampton had recently served as one of Ensign, had been excluded, according to the law to make their former employer or to lobby the Senate for a year.
Those ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair appeared at odds with "Revolving door lobbying ban, " which seeks to restrict former state employees use their connections for personal business.
Of the evidence has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate the Status Revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialises in defending clients vetted by the government.
While officials of the Department of Justice declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed to be cautious when it comes to accepting a political prosecution after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including a decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are patently a coward," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought a number of complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that all senior government officials can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call to an attorney for the Department of Justice on Monday, and another called the next day, saying that the department does not want to lift charges against his client.
The defence team of Ensign had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator and his office confirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to spell out the legal arguments which he gave the prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable entering into details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, which I can only say that we took the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission to alter a separate investigation into a complaint by a group of ethic, which alleges that a payment of $96,000 Ensign's parents to the Hampton violate the federal election law.
The electoral commission said he did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was not a gift.
NV Energy, Nevada, it is a major company that has long supported the senator, which lobby won work through, thanks to the help he gave to Ensign that Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company agreed to in Hampton as lobbying, the Ensign chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him it was "hammering out " the Ministry of Interior on a disputed matter.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another customer in Nevada, and Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to set up a meeting in the name of the airline, which had been hired after Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared over the past year, Ensign asked forgiveness of their constituents and has resigned from his position as Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, two weeks ago, the Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When the spokesman for Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, Ensign announced that it was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, said the senator hoped the ethical committee quickly followed an example of the Department of Justice and to complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has the appetite to continue their hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal aimed at Twitter
I had half a dozen of them via chat rooms on the side of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, sending reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
At the end, said the defence, there were more than 140,000 messages on Twitter on the process to address the violation and children tied to their beds in a house fire was burning.
Thursday, followed the process largely Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, he is ready to come to a formal end the imposition of the death penalty, the judge, the jury voted for.
Mr Hayes's lawyers, but have submitted written arguments outlined that the court of appeals, which will probably take to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense on the reporting process, including the extensive use of Twitter by the massive media journalists, established "a circus atmosphere ," and that immediate and widespread market saturation exaltadores details made public passions have inappropriate influence over the jury.
The claim might oblige the appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the chamber.
"According to what I experienced during this process, and I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting individuals' rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for the defence of Mr Hayes.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue, of State Superior Court dismissed the suit in a decision fairly laconic submission last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence that the jury had been made of the passion.
But will probably not be the last word on the subject.
During decades, courts of appeals have recognized celebres coverage of cases may lead to questions about the fairness of the process.
1966 in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the conviction of osteopaths a Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying their decision in the case, Olsen vs. Maxwell, "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" because of the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV programme and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the Court of Appeal that the sentence discussed by Mr Hayes a half century later, might be puzzled by the argument that it may be necessary to curb new rules form of communication since the courtroom, something inimaginadable at the time the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" in the high profile trial, said John J. Donohue (III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, where he studied the death penalty in Connecticut, wrote in a report in which it was stated that it was imposed arbitrarily.
Donohue said some teacher the appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea to limit immediate notification from the courtroom to the court could make trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the subjects outlined by lawyers of Hayes, who likely will be discussed for years to delay an execution.
Defense lawyers also say that, for example, Hayes could have been harmed when the judge refused to let Blue testearan the reactions of potential jurors, showing them pictures of gruesome crime scene for the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that they were shocked by photos of victims - Jennifer Hawke Petit, aged 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and that the trial judge improperly removed would argue to a jury that had criticized prosecutors incorrectly and had pressed for a verdict on his strange decision to instruct the jury deliberates over a weekend.
Jurors were not abducted.
But their arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract the most interest.
Observed in a challenge the verdict last month shelved the case dominated news coverage in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign for candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
Them argued that media continuously poured fuel on the fire of the excitement about the event.
"The town's daily tweets of media cameras and reporters outside of the court," wrote the attorneys, " was something never seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps in the whole state.
Their attention on the Tweeter coverage, is controversial.
In interviews, journalists said that the complaint, on the fact that women were more important than immediate news reports more slowly delivered, are one vision ludita which make the court's policy on controlling coverage beyond weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts are often attracted by the arguments on the adjustment needed in the courts because of a social and technological changes.
Hayes's lawyers are pushing for this claim.
In his letter, addressed to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which overturned the convictions of Dr. Sheppard was due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that would require further new media rules.
"This case," he wrote, "is if the Olsen vs. Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Can the public spiritedness build a bridge between the divisions?
After a campaign remarkable for the invective and negativity, this week has unfolded a little civility in Washington.
Is it a genuine bipartisan cooperation bodes well for the future, or a delusional one point before a speedy return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders have not produced any breakthrough on the big issues that need to be dealt with during the meeting the outgoing one.
For what they say but everyone was polite at least one discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of shared responsibilities to govern rather than another episode points empty to gain partisan.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit commission was similarly civilized, despite policy differences that exist among the members.
Close interaction, it seems clear that for a period of months resulted in mutual respect which transcends the ideological divide that still separates members.
That is barely sufficient to declare that it has reached a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in a period of probation sondeándose each other to identify signs of cooperation and compromise as they evaluate the limits of public opinion, and the patience of the voters for renewed partisan warfare.
Why the meeting of Tuesday and subsequent assessments of same by participants are made with minimal demands or indictments.
Philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and they are very deeply rooted as quick to suggest a change of climate that existed during the past two years.
Whether taxes, spending, health care and social assistance, the two sides are poles apart.
Anyway, the election of November has softened to the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed about the way of things to say," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"Are inevitable after the election.
Partisan passions aroused by the election, which was then cancelled.
This is a good thing. "
In some areas, especially those who are on the agenda of the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the cuts permanently or temporarily.
In the same vein, it is likely that there will be a commitment to expand its unemployment benefits probably because the Republicans can't make people believe that they are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, to deny unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, there is a growing optimism about a possible deal over these issues at the meeting, along with ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that the successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the meeting not outgoing will necessarily lead to a continuous 112do bipartisanship when the new Congress convenes in January.
Stated that, on the contrary, it is very probable and even inevitable, starting a period of deadlock.
"After that things are done that need to be carried out in the short term, psychology to an adversarial situation, " he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which) is widely shared that civility could lead to a true partnership.
"I think most of what is going to happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event from 2012," he said.
Reasons have very little to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and in the Tea Party voters, who were instrumental in its creation.
Awareness over Republicans leaders about the risks of overdoing her position, know that they have to try to meet their pledges to cut costs and reverse the state of the new health law.
These partisan lines have already been clearly observed in the initial reactions against the deficit commission's recommendations, which include a reform of the tax code and the tax and some increase in the retirement age, and the cost cutting.
Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles are responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, as their own credit ratings - have introduced to force the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
14 but they need votes in the 18 commission members as her plan to publish a formal recommendation, and have been struggling to come close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is between elected officials on the panel, suggested that tax matters there is, at least at the moment, few foundations or desire to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles among Republicans from the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of of supporters clashed when the Republicans challenged Obama on budget, tax and health care, and then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What cause the change?
The public.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisan in the recent election, a majority of Americans still like to see the two parties to work together.
Whether confrontation leads to a standstill, as it did in 1995, then both parties will be watching carefully the reaction of the people.
Consider whoever is losing it is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic vision.
Partisan polarization and are now higher than they were in the middle of the 1990s, and seems to be having a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to the most consequential election in 2012.
Given this reality, civilismo showing this week may be welcome by many Americans.
But that will require much more effort by both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Filtering a US document portrays to Moscow as a paradise of corruption.
Control of the city is in the grip of a "kleptocracy, " and makes it part of a bribery and protection money that raises directly to the Kremlin, as he reported in February, the U.S. Embassy in Russia.
Was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service (FSB) are huge systems of blackmail, which help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
Them collect money not only legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "power vertical ," takes its share to the extent that the money moves up the scale.
The note, which was sent out to Washington under the name of The Ambassador John Beyrle - was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note was based on sources whose names have been censored.
Yuri Luzhkov was written while he was still Mayor of Moscow, and the blame for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence one cleaning since then.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who is a major construction company, has consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands for libel on such allegations.
In September, when a Russian television channel asked him on a television documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, he said: "It is madness, a fabrication, a nuisance. "
According to surveys, the Russians created overwhelmingly that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details spelled out in detail, because they were in the report of the embassy, and it was shocking to be diplomats of a foreign country that do that.
"Direct links Moscow city government on crime have prompted some to call 'dysfunctional ," and asserted that the government operates as a more tailored, as a government, " says the note.
"Those criminal elements krysha 'enjoy' (a term that in the criminal world and the mafia that literally means' ceiling 'or protection by the police and the Federal Security Service (FSB), the MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all branches of the government bureaucracy for the city of Moscow.
Analysts identified a "structure of three tiers in Moscow the criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and militia are in the second tier."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This was a system whereby inefficient criminal groups are filling a void in some areas because the city did not provide a number of services."
The report says that the money he collects SFS larger companies, and that the police in the small shops.
To one source, the report stated, "explained that business owners in Moscow understand that the best thing is to ensure the protection of the MVD (SFS and organised criminal groups) as these not only have the most guns, money and power that the criminal groups, but are protected by law ."
"For this reason, their protection against criminal gangs it is no longer a priority."
The note said that while raising money is total, protection can be irregular, even those who are paying are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay their own business are quickly closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the campaign against corruption, but has confessed that he has achieved little progress.
Note the embassy reports of men taking luggage, probably full of money in cash, within the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, which Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, head of the panel of experts indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of that bureaucracy."
" he does not belong to a political class, because there is a political class in Russia. "
Without politics, without opposition, with a separation of powers, said corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, indem estimated corruption cost him more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global corruption perceptions was carried out by Transparency International, an NGO, the country ranked 154 (countries are ranked from the least to most corrupt).
The disclosure in note to the U.S. embassy, which did not occur until late in the night, Moscow time, and probably will cause upset within the Russian government, and Luzhkov may be faulted for the weaknesses in Moscow, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it was addressing the problem.
Interview for CNN with Larry King, which documents WikiLeaks suggested Putin could be lies and reacted furiosamente by a disclosure that he claimed that American diplomats as Medvedev called Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this goes back to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, and not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with a pressure and, you know, that is a fact so immoral. "
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge to confront the past compelled
Concrete classroom in a poorly lighted, with stained walls descascaradas and the director of the Escuela Secundaria Anlong Veng recalled the man who had constructed, the final leader of the Khmer Rouge, and Ta Mok.
"Ta Mok love all here."
"He is a good leader and was concerned for his people, " he told Ma Sreng Kor (KK) of 42 years.
Known as "The Butcher " by its brutality during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, the commander, remains popular in this remote former stronghold of the Khmer Rouge in the north west of Cambodia, where it constructed hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and which still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year - 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, their loyalty is being sustained for so long finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation commissions allowed victims to confront publicly to those who had been involved in the scheme.
In June, the government distributed a textbook of secondary school he taught that, for the first time in the history of the Khmer Rouge to the sons of the former soldiers.
And in July, a court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, public anxiety has grown between Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to reintegrate them into the Cambodian society.
"There is fear and resentment between the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge, and it was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is causing divisions within the family."
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge on Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork, an estimated 1.7 million people.
In 1979, when the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government, led by Pol Pot, the wreckage of the regime and its military have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There launched an insurrection which lasted until the final movement, which was paid in December 1998.
As Pol Pot regime, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary's guerrilla warfare from bases in the jungles and mountains of western Cambodia, Ta Mok found followers in Anlong Veng.
But by the mid 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN, would lead to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, major groups of fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to desert towards government culminating in renditions of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea, and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was seized by the government back in 1999 in the Dangrek Mountains close.
Prison, died in a Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors - the most former Khmer Rouge fighters downed in the utter misery that is common across rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although few of the elite members of the Khmer Rouge continued local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the rank and file remain poor and unskilled.
"This people has shown few dividends following the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation Commission, that offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They are into utopian agrarian ideology of the regime ."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, of 55 years, who he joined the Khmer Rouge, in 1974, when I was a teenager, he fought in the jungle close to Anlong Veng before life as a farmer of rice low in 1998.
"Living with the Khmer Rouge, and was good," he said.
"Ta Mok was given a meal at all."
"But now because life is difficult autoabastecernos we have to."
Current of the Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, is expected to begin in a court prosecution to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith; another former minister in the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate for the tribunal is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but has not said if it will pursue cases in addition to the four.
This is not done much to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has centred Im Chaem, aged 64, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, which had overseen the building of the dam from Trapeang Thma, a project in which he is believed to have killed tens of thousands of forced labour.
During a recent late infamous, Im Chaem returned to work in the camps to their homes on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts in Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
It argued that if the court does not convene.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there is further prosecutions, there will be war ."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge, in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that it will be a source of instability if pursued more suspects to the court, while the experts and historians the question.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confront the past is precisely what must be done to move to Cambodia, said Youk Chhang, the centre documents.
"Reconciliation, in Khmer, it was the pieces back together," he said.
"It is our obligation to put together these pieces, so that we can understand."
The centre was the first book of which was approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea"), 75 pages.
Anlong Veng in was circulated in June, as a supplement to the book in high school history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, that contains fewer four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most provinces of Anlong Veng young people knows few details of the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the the city's link with the regime.
Valeak curfew, 19, a student at the High School of Anlong Veng, said the new text book helped students understand a significant part of its history.
But parents have reacted with scepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they were not sure about the number of people that will process the court.
Such resistance has made that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge left powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a route through many weeds and strewn with plastic bags dumped lead to a rectangle of black soot covered by a cap of oxidised steel.
Pol Pot's body here was burned on a pile of tyres in the aftermath of his death in 1998.
Sothea Nuom, 31, a mobile vendor at the edge of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a very strong spirit, and many inhabitants rezarle to go there," he said.
Sothea Nuom was the birthday, he decided later that day and walk to the site of Pol Pot's final rest, which would leave a handful of ripe plantains with hope for good luck.
Belarus it accepts to relinquish its uranium reserve for armament
In a surprise victory for the President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear materials around the world, and the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would relinquish its reserve of highly enriched uranium, the critical component of a nuclear weapon.
The deal was revealed in a joint declaration issued after Foreign Minister, that the Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
Years, the US government had been trying to persuade the Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they had come to a point of no return in the spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that it had conducted a couple of ranked with Belarus in the last two months, to remove classified 84,82 kg of uranium for weapons research facility of a Belarussian.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the equipment, some 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke anonymously because of the confidentiality of the item.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, chaired by Obama in April, which ruled to Belarus.
And it appears it was a very good achievement to ensure the invitation to the former Soviet republic at the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 ."
"This shows that this is working," stated Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step " given to Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised, in Prague, Czech Republic, to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries as made under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, saying that the nation will never relinquish its uranium.
"We have conserved the HEU (hundreds of kg of uranium which is basically for weaponry) and qualified low enriched uranium, said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is not... our raw materials is going to produce dirty bombs, and is not going to be selling them to anyone."
"I use for research purposes, is everything. "
However, Belarus was brought to the United States a few months ago showing an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, it was particularly complicated, because the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said was loaded onto a special train that had travelled more than 2,000 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the operation ended on Monday, and the second was made by air.
The US government spent $13 million for the work, and the bulk of the money was used to provide Belarus the research installation of low enrichment of uranium, which is not suitable for a nuclear weapon.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official who worked in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was a coordinated and very carefully orchestrated for strengthening trust" that led to the Agreement signed by President Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies suggested that Belarus had this year at least 40 kilograms of uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential thaw.
Stated that while it welcomed progress in these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus, admitted that more democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the development of the country and its citizens ."
Not the Spanish government objected to CIA flights.
The Spanish government not objected to CIA flights with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners to Guantanamo in Spanish territory, said in a telegram to the US ambassador in Madrid.
Reflect it documents leaked Wikileaks cables (to) the daily El País, which adds that the government's first deputy, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, Spain requested the Executive was informed "to be able to prove who had proper monitoring on foreign jets across Spain ."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accused of complicity in human rights practices contrary to a dozen countries, including Spain, which was followed by a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The woman acknowledged that the report from the Council, "Zapatero Government had got out of the game and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this.
Vega " stressed that Spain has no compunctions intelligence flights through Spanish territory. "
"They just want to be informed," to avoid being "caught by surprise," recounts Ms. Aguirre in a cable.
Also the holder then Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said the Spanish ambassador for the Government "wanted to give this the lowest profile, though, to be in the hands of judges, the government was limited in its ability to influence."
For its part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez delivered to the embassy that she would not seek to block the move of the judge to ask for the release of the documents in the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any sensitive information and no incriminating," explained to the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
However the US reflected his concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors in Germany ," rather than by the information declassified the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"Coordination between this independent investigators could complicate efforts to operate quietly between the governments," said Aguirre.

Ambassador also expresses its concern about the performance of the People's Party (PP) in this matter.
"Despite his general guideline pro, our experience suggesting that the PP will not hesitate in capitalizing on any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that might have been construed as a possible violation of human rights, even if they have negative implications for the revelations from the US Government," he said.

The popular will win 4 seats in Congress, and the PSC would lose 9.
28 with the results (of the PP could be decisive in the municipalities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the large increase in votes and experienced Members at the recent regional elections, the PP Catalan is already looking ahead to general elections, there are no or advancement, the outlook is more positive because the number of votes they get this training in these polls is often double as it receives in Catalan.
Thus 610.473 Catalans won the popular votes in general elections in 2008, whereas in Spain in 2006, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPP won 384.091 votes.
Retained this upward trend, which has benefited from a shift of votes, the PSC and the loyalty of the PP's electorate, this formation Analysts have calculated that, if it is to hold a general election, the PPP could be 8 to 12 seats in Congress, while a city would also (10) is now four and the PSC will lose no fewer than nine members (25).
These calculations constatarían Square that is instrumental in PP and Catalan PSOE.
According to the analyses of populists, ERC would lose three -- now a parliamentarian -- whereas CVI has left with a colleague or to buy one.
But if the timing of the election, it will be the most immediate in May 2011 with the local elections, where the roots can also be decisive at the end of the hegemony of socialist in the four provincial capitals and in them at the forefront of Barcelona Diputación, a government that handles budget more - €661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists as popular agreement on the likelihood that the PSC will lose city of Barcelona, to Tarragona, Gerona Lérida and, where the Socialists gained majority or possibility of appealing to their traditional partners, ERC and CVI.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable that this training will lose their representation to the Consistory barcelonés - requires 5 per cent of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in four capitals and potentially decisive force in Barcelona Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists staged are convinced to the turnaround tarraconense in the capital, where it ruled with the PP before the current socialist Mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
Lérida on, the PP has been located just 500 votes for the PSC, whose Mayor Ros Àngel, maintains good relationships with Mariano Rajoy -- during this last campaign, was found on a number of occasions.

Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
Seven Nigerian arrested by Pakistani agents, and the Office of the Superintendent of Police in Barcelona that a jihadist cell, led in Thailand, different groups gave passports to Al Qaeda, including "Ways for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba (Let), author of the latest terrorist attacks in Bombay, killed 106 people in 2008.
The Home Office has given much importance to this investigation, up to the point of ensuring that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the falsification of Al Qaida on the international level and, therefore, its operational capacity ."
The researchers calculated that of the cell, in the two years it has been active at Catalonia, sending out thousands of passports has been to Thailand where they were fake, and then distributed to groups that make up the galaxy to its criminal for Al Qaeda " fighters "to cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
Destamantelada the cell is not the only one that was operational in the jihadist network in Europe, which is why the investigations involved, in addition to services of Thai, other European police units, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that in the whole of the EU need to be carried out in the coming days similar coups to develop during the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with the Pakistanis were arrested in the operation (Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, and Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad Mohammad SADDIQUE Begum Khan, Arshad and Tanveer Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), was conducted in Thailand, with the arrest of the Pakistani Muhammad Ehsan Athar Butt and Zeeshan Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung Butt and Thai.
These were the ones heading from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
Catalan network - part of it hit for 2009 mainly for tourists - robaba passports that complied with the requirements set by the "World Islamic Front."
I.e., documents must be in the name of a male aged between 25 and 45 years, in a period of several years and without visas stamped.
Media research highlights that, for the moment, no evidence has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia in the attack in Mumbai, in spite of the fact that the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving the stolen passports forged in Spain and then to Thailand.
However, it is worth remembering that in the days leading up to the attack was committed, in Catalonia were shipped via a money transfer agency a few thousand dollars they were "invested " in purchasing mobile business cards that were subsequently used by members of the" commandos "killed 106 people.
Police have seized a lot of documentation.
Called Mas, which the PP to tax conspiracy shelving
The leader of the PPP, as Alicia Sanchez and Camacho, was able yesterday to explain personally to Artur Mas their conditions to support his nomination as chairman of the Generalitat, identical to those raised during the campaign and that was brief to give priority to the restoration of the economy and without Democrats edged sovereignists adventures, as is the economic system that the nationalist leader wants to raise at the midpoint of their terms.
The popular chairwoman of the Catalans turned the meeting of Artur Mas with security that gives MPs have won 18 in Sunday's election, which is more than enough to be done, because the candidate city requires that at least one of the courses that will have opposition to abstain in the vote.
Understanding of a potential future PP to depend on alliances that the Nationalists want to continue in the Congress where they will hold a general election, but, for the time being, these days talks that kept Mas with the rest of our political leadership are in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the People's Party (PP), to support an installation "that parking be all the independence and sovereignty statements," as well as economic - similar to the final concert of the Basque Country - which focused leader is even put to a referendum.
The two leaders have in common your bet by slimming the political apparatus of an autonomous administration very swollen and the elimination of the inheritance tax and charitable donations.
Details of negotiation on the investiture of Mas will by the CFP, Jordi Cornet Dolors and Montserrat.
Mas has met Nadal (Joaquim with PSC) -- who has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (CVI), and today we will make with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert (Rivera ciutadans Solidaritat LaPorta) and Joan (Catalan).
The nursing home claims that the deaths were not the "lack of action."
Owners ruled out centre of Olot their not governor killed more of 11 elderly
Nursing officials of Olot Caritat The (Girona) yesterday gave a press conference to highlight the harm he has caused in the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse was there while employee killed at least eleven elderly who was in charge.
The director of residence, Joan, was accompanied by a lawyer at the center, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the desire Caritat The be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility we have to address the situation of civil responsibility ."
And it is also the case that the social prestige that the company may suffer for not having identified the governor time criminal activities, the biggest threat is now in the form of abundant Caritat compensation already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime can be traced back to August 2009, and since then there has been a shooting.
The judge said in the indictment that already ordered the exhumation of eight corpses - old geriatric patients - a suspicion that, in many instances, no doctor was exploring himself to the deceased, but that, in the age and ailments of patients, a procedure despachaba by telephone.
Caritat the through his manager, denied yesterday resoundingly this and pointed out that "the lack of action, he could not have been at any time because of what has happened."
The counsel Caritat added that "in the case, there is not a single sign that has been reckless action by any person other than the accused."
Already dubbed the "Angel of Death," the day before he confessed to the 11 murders and itemized first crime committed on 29 August 2009, a month and a half later a second kill grandmother.
In this case, triggered pinchándole death an overdose of insulin, which in contrast to the first crime committed helping of a combination of sedative tablets.
Caritat The director pointed out that it was difficult to check that the centre's staff have access to medication.
Those pinching of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism used in six of the nine that the nurse of crimes in an attempt to alleviate the suffering of the displaced, were used to killing them.
But the analysis that are made in the lab which will clarify whether or not he lied for Vila and his first victims, or less cruel death if, conversely, by providing within abrasó bleach as has already confessed that he killed three women by between 12 per cent and the 17 October.
Caritat in the demonstrations do not lend credence to the caretaker, or even the number of murder confessed, it did not rule out that it is superior, and justify its position in the different versions which has made visits Vila in the courthouse and it has made little sense to change their way of doing things after having committed, with success, eight murders.
That is why I say that it will be made available to the courts to clarify the scope of the event.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday the threat yesterday of Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral spreads with force had closed and shares of European banks have risen by more than 5 per cent.
However, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB being wrong and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What has taken place yesterday was of a market that collapses like ilíquido recovers but prompted by short closing their positions and highly speculative.
Institutional investors will lose their fear.
One month ago the ECB today cited steps to withdraw liquidity retractar morning and will be the fourth time in two years and what is left.
Bundesbank the end required the plan to purchase government debt by inefficient and eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity to run unlimited access, leaving only a week.
After the Irish crisis hope to prolong current liquidity measures " until at least March, "and keep unlimited access in quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter in order to ensure liquidity, at least until June.
Also expect to continue with its programme to purchase bonds and even to give the signal regulation.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated reverse the excellent market reaction yesterday, and if measures remain stubborn at withdrawing liquidity, let God help us!
Like in its meeting in May in which they said that they had not even contemplated buying bond markets collapsed and, tomorrow may be another story.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
Bazuca in May announced on Monday, and on Wednesday said that it had bought a lot, leading to a collapse in the new market.
The auction yesterday of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
Treasury alone has issued 500 million to 5.28 per cent, versus 750 million from 4.81% at the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points in the entire curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet.
Ireland, it has made public the numbers of the hole from Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Figures are estimated about 10,000 billion in the short term and others potential 15,000 and have until February to secure private capital or be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July, with the stress test, are the numbers workable within Support Scheme and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get congressional approval of its new budget and still has sufficient support at what Ireland remains a locus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has been a softening of the tone of the speech to ease tensions ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to show that a political compromise that we are together and we are all from the same hymn book.
The problem is that the German wants to touch Mr. Wagner and the rest of the national anthem the joy of Beethoven.
Spain, the gift of the president had the opportunity to submit a plan of measures yesterday to approve on Friday the Council of Ministers.
Pensions reform, transparency in Communities and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment are ringing in the ears of investors and its four stations from Vivaldi.
Trichet and the dual effect ZP explained to the Spanish Bolsa has risen 4.5 per cent, double that of the rest of European Exchanges.
February, in contrast to the reaction of government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the effect of a surprise.
Today there is an auction of a key bond in three years which will benefit from the impact of what we expect Trichet to be resolved with the heavy demand and to help allay any doubt on our ability to refinance.
Spain to ask for a plan would be a de Ayuda immolation.
We would provide a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury had more than $40 billion in available liquidity on triple that in March, at the Te closed the exorbitantly expensive types and markets access to an unspecified date.
However, the strategy must remain, the Caesar's wife, "and to be seen to be fair."
Spirit, we can.

The last movement of John Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, David Alvarez, is described as "a remedy of desperate asylum for her five children, using a procedural ploy, in the Bill clear fraud and abuse of the law, to try to reward and to restructure the board radically from 18 January to zero," according to her spokespeople.
This case will lay the groundwork for that, once on the board, should be challenge on the grounds that it was "null and void."

This case is the question of fund that should the judge decide to once hold a hearing on the lawsuit in a challenge, for which there is still no target date.
Triumphs in Bull F1 grid with a secret weapon of Siemens
Designing software improvements in cars in real time.
Red Bull since he broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, the story of the elite in this universe has been marked by the speed and surprise by the success.
The first time anybody took into account options escudería a newcomer, and despite upward trajectory of recent seasons - last November, at the end of the championship all stationed by the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from their skill as a pilot last champion and German Sebastian Vettel, nor engine capacity for Renault that powers your car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend, the "secret weapon " that Siemens has become the multinational company of Red Bull in the hands on into a winning team.
It is, in fact, a powerful software simulation process of that German was on the market in 2007 with late distant contest's high automobile.
Called PLM, this powerful software tool has been used to design an assembly line manufacturing plants around the globe, energy plants, tools for high accuracy.
The goal is to reproduce faithfully simulating the product or process to build it so right, avoiding this avoidable costs and judgments.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras with Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft or the utility most famous cars from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, said that the use of such software tool factory in its Formula 1 Red Bull design has enabled and implement "in a few hours, nearly in real time," the changes, which are detected changes and enhancements during races and testing.
Escuderías Russwurm explains that in 1992 took an average of 10 in which his team were able to introduce a maximum of three or four cars at improvements for each season.
Red Bull team are now working than 180 young professionals highly skilled which, equipped with powerful hardware, analysis and planning all sorts of modifications in fireballs.
The steering of the PLM software explained that Siemens was able to analyse and improve all the elements the fireballs with the exception of the Red Bull driver, who was Renault full responsibility.
Amend materials, fuel, the airfoil and security features.
Changes can take a virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to the advanced production systems, laser autoclaves and high technology.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological sophistication is the figure of 40 million that each team could spend as Formula 1 season ever up to facilitate competition.
Bull factory network has mounted of high technology to design and produce their fireballs in a village some 50 miles from London.
These two buildings in which are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that is happening, it is considered "top secret."
The template for this purpose amount to 580 people, including two pilots, Mark Webber and Vettel champion.
The hero for the Red Bull Formula 1, of course, the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the vast technological resources of energy drink brand has been in the service of their participation on the circuit, there are others whose support is invaluable and your visibility to zero.
The head of technology to the factory, as Steve Nevey, said that five years ago, it could be said that the R & D progress in handcarts cars accounted for 50 per cent of the winners, and the pilots are responsible for the rest.
These percentages have changed and today the technology amount, 85 per cent of success, while pilots contributed 15 per cent of total value added.
Nevey acknowledges Vettel and Webber will never to be replaced by computer since "gladiators are unpredictable. "

Sabadell bid to 'steal' one million customers to its rivals in three years.
Managers more optimistic than others, the director of the Banco Sabadell deputy Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but had initially ruled out a fresh crisis of liquidity and is predicting the end of the war of the liabilities.
Nonetheless, for a collapse in profit margins, which will be offset in part by increases in fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes in three years one million individual customers, his piece of unfinished business.
Sabadell had found a way to take advantage of the next three years and to be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank rolled out in 2011 a new master plan, which will remain in force for three years.
The aim, also survive without the need for state subsidies of the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers -700.000 discounted if they can get out of the bank, their big challenge, since until now had pampered more for SMEs to retail customers and businesses.
250,000 customers this year has attracted 50,000 individuals and businesses.
Their share of the market in specific is 3.5 per cent, while that in companies exceeds 10 per cent.
Another 2011 / 2013 the base plan is a bid to improve productivity, which is the same thing, from austerity, with cost reduction target, and whose will be the challenges when the banks present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to set targets to make them public and that the financial crisis has already affected all schemes of the banking world.
Sabadell, indeed, your manager will be concluded this year plan Optima set four years ago, but were initially for three months, but the state of the market meant that it will expand an exercise more.
Customers escape to stop savings banks will be his main objective.
In a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and critical."
The Executive, in fact, believe that the way out of the crisis for Spain "will be sluggish."
In addition, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create jobs ," which is essential to the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, while believing that war of the liability, which criminalizes the focus is narrowing the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions are paying for its emissions to achieve liquidity are moving because the price of credit, to offset the collapse in spreads.
"The issue of it is structural and funding liquidity, and it is going to be a factor, to put pressure on the credit."
"We have not shut the tap, but higher spreads," conceded Guardiola.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit the credit over the long term, and increase the price differentials CincoDías -ver of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognized the trend in banking now "is to raise fees," but "there is a competitive framework ."
Sabadell director of the scheme is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group cannot exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, says that in Spain "is going to require larger sizes. "
"The next year is going to change everything," he assured.
States that capital requirements are "gone up enormously" and does not preclude any financial entity in Spanish red.
And aims that the FROB could fill the market in recruiting funds new before recapitalizations.
Sabadell to ensure that it can survive after the temporary closure of the markets shrugged off what some bankers predicting as a new credit crunch.
Notes that cannot be broadcast, but the opposite of what happened in June, was unable to obtain financing in the short term through repos, which smoothes the crisis.
The ECSC out a second wave of mergers in the boxes.
The director general of the European Coal and Steel Community, José António Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers in savings banks and has again stressed the speed with which it is implementing the restructuring of the sector.
When ripped the concentration of the Spanish savings banks, were several entities who said it would not participate in the first phase and that was set aside for the second round.
However, the director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José António Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I believe that the greatest part of the merger has been mainstreaming Civic Bankers Cajasol the group could not be said to be a second round, there are adjustments."
"The biggest part was completely made; they may instead of popping 17 to 13 or 14, but all the major trials have been done already and be monitored by the Bank of Spain, which is this has worked very well," said the manager.
In statements at a breakfast meeting of the Association of Directors of Leadership and Aragon (ADEA) Olavarrieta has outlined the process of assembly is moving "with the greatest speed possible, and we have to be very pleased, as has been happening in that time, not now, was ushered on business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
45 "switch boxes containing an average of 28.5 million of the assets of 17 with 75.5 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of partners by a 62 percent to be much larger to comply with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of views quite unwise about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate a "lack of seriousness and sense " because of" what it does to the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be well within the deadline before the end of this year ."
The director general of the European Coal and Steel Community, José António Olavarrieta, claimed yesterday that the Spanish have more rigorous financial system across Europe and "probably" in the world, and claimed those who call into question "a lack of knowledge."
The director pointed out that, in the current economic downturn, "we are very comfortable" with the status of the financial institutions and savings banks - a system which has embarked on a process of assembly "very important " and that" going to be the fastest feasible ."
Banking also recalled that the Spanish left very well to the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and German red line.
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro zone, but has set conditions for the entire European Union.
Strains in the markets had led double a government response.
By a hand, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has gone further adjustment measures, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or deletion of the 426 euros in aid for unemployed without provision to privatization of 49% for Aena, airport management to Barajas and El Prat Lotteries and 30% of the state.
By another, and Elena Salgado the deputy, with the support of the president, Felipe González, has joined the criticism, with the Angela Merkel by his responsibility Cancillera in triggering the current crisis.
How we interpret these movements?
Goes ahead that the stance of Mrs. Merkel is not a policy mistake in its communications.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the process of redefining the euro hard.
And that Germany has a radical new vision of what their future should be, which is at odds with the traditions of the old to sustain good portion of its partners.
European meet resistance in Germany begins to realm of speculation three potential exits for the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed by her, Austria and the Netherlands, among others, while the south would leave the euro zone.
The second is the framework for recovery, although it now appears to be science fiction - with a current of opinion favorable very close to 50% of the population.
The third, and a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals most macroeconomic policy, budgetary rigour, fines for errant countries, possible suspension of payments and any outreach to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has defined for a long time, so now there is no excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission, the budget deficits fuelled, the German government was pushing for a constitutional amendment to prevent that from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what she believed that Germany should be fiscal rigour (plans and stability in public finances, and that they were practising its partners in Europe, including France.
The second front in the central European country were lengthened distressingly when Merkel's decision to rescue Greece.
It was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth of the matter is that the political consensus in favour of Germany and to the public and issued very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, she has a clear position, demanding reform of the European Union treaties to make a rescue possible, and at the same time, forcing private lenders to pay part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti, as precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, if a bit toned down, it has been approved, and in the next few months, we should see the process of reform of the European Union that allows them those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to pass.
And he is telling us all that, even if it has taken measures that may not be very sympathetic, from that date the old operation of the euro, will be completed.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary areas, in which the countries will be severely punished, they may be forced to go into default, and in this case, the private sector will bear much of the cost.
Germany is saying that we have to continue to be a strong growth path with a high rate of saving and investment, in restraint use, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
Alternative based construction debt and the huge holes in the balance of payments, as he has presided over the growth of English during the years of the boom, will simply not going to be tolerated.
The challenge is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand.
It is not just to bring the public deficit down to 3% in 2013.
What we require is much more severe.
And the worst thing that we could do in these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope that the present turbulence no longer step to greater tranquillity.
And that we can take advantage of the window of opportunity which have given us until the spring of 2013.
Zapatero also believe that the president has understood this well and showed his twin (the reforms promised after a meeting on Saturday with the major companies and the new announcement yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism from Angela Merkel, it has opened up a way that you put house in order.
But the red line to Germany has outlined is here, and it does not appear to be moving.
And, among the options that are being contemplated, leaving monetary zone too atiborrada countries little serious, could not be excluded.
Then, Germany provided we will be able to say that we already had warnings.
Sports law and fraud.
Alonso, of the waywardness and Ramos before the Ajax showed ingenuity but unwilling to escape a fine.
Removal allegedly engineered by two players from Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos in the party find the 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has led much ink to write about if such behaviour was unsporting and whether or not, eventually, both players had to be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, to the lack of a few minutes to go, the party (his team clearly had won), the two players have deliberately lost time to make two mistakes, which lead them to show the referee second yellow card.
In that way, and since the end of Real Madrid as the leader of their group, both players will handle the regulatory penalty liguilla of the next game, against Auxerre, and can clean pass card to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has punished two games with the team's coach and Jose Mourinho, with different economic numbers for the players involved.
The provocation a yellow card in this or similar circumstances and it is not a new practice, but more prevalent in the world of football.
Is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but a stretch, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case was reported to have been carried out by a team from the Royal that entity in its hymn (Madrid boasts of nobility and honor and which in the past has fined similar acts by his players in the drama) and staged, apparently, for Mourinho, who added one more episode to his vast technical history of sweeping and provocative.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this sort of behaviour was not specifically prohibited by the rules contradicted principles of sport - if these actions committed fraud bill; since, in fact, are in keeping with the rules of sport, but we seem to be shirking their meaning.
The question is to look at the kind of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
One of the assets that comprised the sportsmanship is the physical safety of the players, which with these actions were not put at risk, which is to say, there have been no violent game.
Another of these assets, which were referred to the game is to avoid the offending players team unfairly takes advantage of the team, something which did not happen.
However, paradoxically, the work of the players in the Real Madrid is that not what normally was accommodated to trap or stand out as fraud law, since its infringement of the rules will not be done in secret to avoid a fine, but that is exactly the action sought to be as clear to the umpires and get the punishment.
The expected and accepted gladly sanction.
Another question is what advantage gets offenders examined in intentional misconduct.
Here believe it is necessary to say that places not be at a disadvantage to a rival or be benefiting at the same party - as clearly the result of the action involves leaving the team with fewer players.
And it is a useful strategy to the next game, then the club will not be able to count for those players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League, which could threaten his future involvement in a party.
But it is an advantage over the long term, with a high degree of uncertainty because the team may be eliminated at the first opportunity, and with that performance players play a match penalty and spend the second cycle of cards, in which card accumulation suspension occurred with one less than in the first round.
So, go through rounds, it is less clear that it will be an advantage.
Ultimately, they are not going against the spirit of sportsmanship, of which it is a part, take strategic decisions favouring capitalize on what is permissible under the rules.
In the event, the players not acted to evade the application of the penalty, that it would be a clear case of tax fraud, but rather that when elected to undergo it.
Took a strategic decision to not circumvent the punishment or flee.
Although the border between genius and the fraud law is vague on this occasion I think that that was a clear case of a genius.
The controversy, it seems, comes from two factors: It was because two autoexpulsiones and the manner in which it is conducted, the guideline for such deaths.
The damage led to the sport's principles for these actions is not only ethical as aesthetic.

Pakistani nuclear program generates deep concern in the US.
Islamabad has atomic weapons "a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks's leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.

The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes was watched not just by America, but also for Russia, as a proliferation risk and cause to keep the ball.
"Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs, to protect nuclear facilities; given the collapse of educational standards and cultural organizations are more opportunities for extremists to recruit people to work for the nuclear and missile programs," said the expert Yuli Korolev, the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his US counterparts.
The newest materials filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high pace of the production of nuclear weapons.

Hunting of Wikileaks head
Obama appoints a senior official of the fight against terrorism to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issued a high alert to monitor the movements and Assange to locate where it is.
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a tangled maze in which it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track movements " Assange.
However, it is not an arrest warrant.
Addition, it is not new, but that dates back 20 November.
And has nothing to do with the leak last more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian is in Sweden.
Additionally, the builder of Wikileaks's lawyer, Mark Stephens, said that "the police knew where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange.
20 was the day when the international police agency based in Lyon (France) has issued the warrant at the request of the Swedish, but not revealed yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities in this country.
Things, Interpol have indications of 188 countries to identify or locate to Assange "with a view to their arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person hit by a red warning, many member countries, as explained by the organization, as the notice called network channel free to proceed with an arrest -- is facing national police corps, particularly if has a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in England and Sweden, where it was believed that Assange is.
The move has angered the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter alleging that the founder of Wikileaks, for 39 years, said he was willing to answer video questions from Swedish authorities.
Assange also remind that sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor in the case, compared to that of the mythical Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin " s security chief.
"This seems to be the one hunting, not legal persecution," denounces the message.
While the world as from Australia, is seeking his mother defends hijo-- Assange his innocence, remains unaccounted for, but it is not silent.

Their opinion was demonized by yesterday the press secretary to the White House, Robert Gibbs, which was described as "ridiculous and absurd" the request for his resignation.
"I am not quite sure why we should import the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself had appointed a senior official of the fight - Rusell Travers, to prevent further escapes of documents.
The attempt of the president " s spokesman to belittle Barack Obama views contrasts with Assange proclaim these days politicians and conservative commentators.
Peter King, a Congressman from January will chair the Committee on National Security in the House, has called on the Department of State to look at the possibility of including in the Wikileaks list of terrorist organizations, "the power to intervene, and his wealth and persecute them to any or any contribution of aid."
Even further had been Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has had to backtrack after Assange say it should "be killed."
"Obama should make it a goal and using a drone or something."
Who have not apologized was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister and Arkansas governor and possible candidate for the presidency.

ERC Puigcercós seeks peace in the wink with echoing Carod
Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot vote on their continuation.
Huguet executive proposes a more pluralist asambleario and the end of the system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to deal with the domestic unrest in the first ranks of ERC, but north with the loss of 11 members, and more than half of the votes.
The party president is conscious that her false resignation proved insufficient to the allied exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of the industry is now so diluted as their own mentor him in any way, and that can cause headaches with other common extinct.
So, the win leader for Esquerra try the new critics wink to insulate themselves up to the local elections.
To begin Puigcercós yesterday announced that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC may decide its continuity in secret.
Slips through, and not a show of hands.
Carodistas if the vehicle you want true vote of retribution the chairman, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of the military wants to avoid the image of both division as subjection to his person.
In a number of interviews, he said that would not be ratified with more than half of the votes, but he added, without specifying a percentage, it is not a good result "in Bulgaria."
Carod to require the next president to his post to be a little bit more accessible to militancy, a gesture that is not controlling when Puigcercós the highest organ between congresses.
But in the absence of a large enough majority to force resignations, will try to agree on a road map to an executive in May.
For it, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation that management be put to a vote of the national council of the day 18.
Puigcercós to underwrite his intention is that this promises to change Congress to move the fall of 2011, something which the top already takes for granted.
ERC's leader acknowledged "polyphony " undermines stability and that its aim is to ensure that, once and for all, the organization was able to wash the dirty linen of gates towards the inside.
In this same vein, it is symptomatic article that the Caretaker Huguet conseller Josep signed in his blog.
As the ideologue Puigcercós, the incumbent gave Innovació of the fact that the leader will be signed "in exchange for a variety of objectives ."
Listed and five, two stand out.
The first "fix " the executive to account for at least 90 per cent of him, namely, putting fresh blood provided Carod akin to the sector.
The second may be the great innovation.
Huguet proposed to settle once the ERC asambleísmo as a mechanism.
So, advocates for a reform of the constitution to hold the congress by elected delegates.
Ending asambleario the model, was an exception in a party system has been an obsession Puigcercós team, which had already fought in this way for the past two Congresses.
In fact, the celebration left the troubled 2008 commissioned to review the leadership at a congress focused asambleísmo reform of regulations.
This quotation remains pending, because the tide in recent years argued against internal address the issue.
Now, without critical sectors in wait, can be a good time to break back and try to close it down for good.

Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students.
"If law coincides to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, to call your senators ínstalos and is to adopt legislation," tweeteó estadunidense chairman at the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national movement in support of the Dream Act legislation, undocumented students to legalize, with a message on his personal account at the social network Twitter.
"If law coincides to pass the Dream Act is appropriate, to call your senators and ínstalos to adopt is legislation" tweeteó Obama.
Their brief message keeps open a link in a cyber most comprehensive document that calls to the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote on the legislation is now imminent.
"With one vote which is expected to happen soon, but now is the time to make your voice heard," she said.
The message was released after 42 senators, Republicans threatened to block the vote on any legislation, or at least approval of the extension of the tax cuts from the Bush administration and the government funding.
Such an embargo, announced in a letter signed by all Republican senators, 42, could have an impact on the vote of the Dream Act legislation and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Challenged by blocking Republican to the Dream Act and other laws the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs ruled that once relied on the tax issue, it may set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I think there is a lot of time..."
"All agree that we have to resolve the matter before the end of the tax year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement at some point on that, and then we can plan the sequence from the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that it would be "a vote to close debate on the" law for the Dream Act, thus the effort to legalize undocumented students could be beginning to be voted on Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act, a bill would legalise the American Dream to nearly 800 youngsters who went to the United States before age 16 and have stayed in the country for the past five years and placed in an institution of higher education and the military.
But, supporters needed 60 votes to approve the legislation, which would require the support of a few Republicans, at a time when organizations supporting the bill have an intense lobbying to ensure the passage of the legislation.
Democrats, the majority of whom supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
So, proponents of the Dream Act would require adding to several Republicans in the event that other democrats choose to back the initiative.
Cortejados more among Republicans are the senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as former Senator George Lemieux, Florida, who had completed the terms of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans in the past, supported the Dream Act was Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they do not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives, has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces major obstacles in the Senate.
Literature with the finger
The second round of The pleasures of language was a walk where participants showed the storytelling
"Sex is in the language you understand... but the finger? What is expected of me?" Asked the writer Lisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of language, of literature that celebrates Spanish who used this opportunity, and the subtitle of your question (another fairground, the panel focused on The sex in their languages, he said).
The finger... 'we are in trouble, "the Argentine writer espetó dulcemente the public, most of them young, who assembled at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to hear the panel moderated by Marisol Shultz and were where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text on Gonzalo Celorio after Shultz would define that as a great tale with Luisa in the first person, as the protagonist in the search of what is the "problem ," is going from doctor to doctor, which does not get the answers but it tracks in the same narrative thread.
Infectólogo is convinced of: "Patience is not my strong suit, perhaps my heart."
At the end, after a thwarted traumatólogo bonding with the encouragement that she has robbed him in the middle of the aisle, but he clarified that pulse is not a scientific term; it is a mystery who discloses psicoanalista: "The wound was what is real, and the scar is symbolic."
Sighed and relieved the actor concluded "I only know that the problem is real and that it is not open" but convinced that the joys and the pitfalls of the language must be highly interlinked.
Valenzuela, a writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a story headlined Elogio deleitosa that invention where the finger is not named but are discovered at a time.
With smatterings of magical realism, a famed sorceress, visiting the same roof, I came back from the men who had gone further advertising or the virtues which have been lost are virgins - storytelling that has turned to speak then America's great novel down to from the beginning of its own reporters who had quoted and Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticize after the excesses of captains by conquistadors.
Cervantes " that all we invented (writers) made a mockery of that sham witnesses appeared in stories presented as real, but another way would never have come to tell the story of America, with imaginations that lacked up to decency ."
However, he stressed "fools are peddled and who better to imagine " and converges is where reality and lie, because it was not known that it said belong to one side or another, where the literary fiction reached its apogee.

"I think good literature, poetry, good songs offer a tacit pledge which, of course, was not premeditated," he said, citing that the literature is the reality of the scale of the communication and commitment it forges between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction " of the past.

Felt that in a world that is in a hurry, but also in custom control and intellectual minds is that dogma, forgetting that "behind every assertion there is a small and not behind every denial there was a small."
"For we can be masters of our minds, and that we can be masters of nuance that is true: And nuance often implies to put his finger on the pulse and annoy those who are much more comfortable looking at caricature, in black and white, and without nuance by established ideas and annoy the powers would prefer a world in black and white," he said, inviting back the sense of writing.
Romano is going for its first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had its ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times already in the series critical.
Santos Laguna of mourning with Monterrey and in the end, also was faced with two different styles marked by their technical, who found each other on a steep contrast to the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals, has had its ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times already in the series critical, although until now it has been empty, and that is why this is a very special occasion for him.
The Argentinean has completed subcampeón consolándose with the medal, has been a step backwards to the winners, and the same team has oddly with a final played in a row.
The strategist Santista reached his first final as coach in the Tournament opening 2002, when he took the reins from the Morelia, which fell 2 4 overall at Toluca before; later, in 2003, also found a closing instrumental duel and also lost overall in 3 to 1, and it was at hand.
With Santos Laguna in the Bicentenary Tour 2010, again in the face of devils, Rubén again suffered a setback, since its team finished tied at 2 before / 2 210 choriceros after minutes of the game, but in the round came pénaltis of advantage by 3 - 1 with two chances to clinch the title for the last three players failed theirs since the 11 steps voltereta and had 4 to 3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the devils Reds and a Monterey with its rival over time, so does not want to suffer the same fate, to get rid of evil and power for the first time celebrate a title, but said that for him the most important thing is the institution.
Champion "I want to leave, I do not wish to break no statistic, this is a club on a pastime to which I and therefore the title will come to me, but this is the most important," commented the helmsman when questioned about the numbers playing against that has to end.
Was very much alive in the final, which she has learnt a lot, " the only education that we can bring to bear is that, until the umpire silbe the end we cannot celebrate, we are ready for the top, players, too, because last time, on two criminal charges thrown already prepared us to hurry and I believe that this is an educational, until the end of the game we are celebrating ."
Know that this series could be in dead criminal, something that he was not worried, because he trusted his players: "One ever made to reach the group of criminal you want to finish on time, but sometimes there are other and we have to be ready in the earlier tournament we were unprepared, we unfortunately made a bad move at the destination, because sometimes the nerves or the anxiety of taking the title in his hands, but it was there, that there was something to this end that I hope does not come to the end."
Romano has in its hands to be a technician subcampeón for the first time and to prove that giving the title glory.

Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
Wednesday at Estrie, has done a dozen acts of persecution during the dismantling a network production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested, who will face a variety of charges.
Persecutions have occurred, in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, particularly in the places where they performed in the production of the drug.
"I have about 750 plants seized cannabis four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for the production," notes Louis - Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Safety of Quebec.
In total, eleven men have been arrested and three females, including two alleged leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Detainees were to appear at the courthouse of Sherbrooke in the hours following his arrest.
Could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, theft of services and conspiracy, among others.
These persecutions have been produced following a lengthy investigation which has lasted nearly a year.
"It has been the basis of information provided by the public which has enabled us to make the arrest," said Ruel Mr.
In this police operation involved approximately 70 personnel research module Estrie Quebec of the Security, Police Service of Sherbrooke Memphrémagog and the Police Department.
Illegal migration may be fought without any problems.
The Conservative Bill which, according to the government, it should address the problem of boats loaded of clandestine migrants, were likely to face considerable opposition, as the three opposition parties had announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I base mainly in the Letter."
"I am here with a party that has been created that the granite pisáis, " declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies following the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would halt for up to a year to anyone who engages a vessel identified as illegal immigrants violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec, the Bloc leader, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it is aimed at the wrong target.
"We are against it, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against the project, as well as see what the Government is doing, " Mr Duceppe told the newspaper.
NPD the criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism by a stroke, who pointed out that his party is not sufficiently strong to illegal immigrants.
Neodemócratas "agree that action be taken against those responsible for the clandestine boats and that is what we intend to do with another bill, (C / 35," said the lady Chow.
"I do not support the bill because of the Conservatives attacking refugees and incarcerates children for at least a year," said the Mr Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused the party of playing the position of politicians and of ignoring the wishes of the Canadian public.
"The vast majority of Canadians said to MPs that do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, criminal operations against Canada and who deal with the country as a doormats."
Canada expects to take "tough measures," said the minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on the bill, which could lead the country to the polls as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative, told QMI Agency that the government would seek a vote to each MP to go to explain after opposing to their constituents.
The new unit fails to unanimity
Despite that it had announced the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation on the issue.
Minister of Public Safety Robert Dutil, supports this idea, which has not been raised for two days: Quebec should have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York is concerned since January last year.
France holds a permanent unit to combat corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement on Tuesday, has come as a great surprise to more than one.
I can say is that, during a meeting of the Council for a permanent police in Quebec held on 29 October, had never discussed the measure despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was not enough for the party's critical between dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement as a "rabbit out of the hat" and as "a cheap solution last minute."
Dutil Minister, for his part, has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence over a prospective unity.
"Arm when we announce the results," he said simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ chairman, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can substitute for the launching of a public inquiry.
"The more determined Mr Charest to avoid the creation of this commission of inquiry, most people share our view, which is to say, that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is through the resignation of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance, the national school of public administration.
To break the impasse, suggested a special mandate to make Quebec the comptroller general to carry out a survey about the collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to extend the mandate of the comptroller general," it concludes.
I also believed that Quebec could give the controller the same skills that a commissioner, to enable it to compel individuals to give evidence.
Creating a permanent crew is not the only project to Charest in the fledgling government.
Quebec also called to Ottawa that would change the penal code that is better suited for this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the tax for the operation, which has been reported to the Justice Minister Jean Marc Fournier of jurisprudence is not explicit on this kind of research.
The federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is tipped now to make certain amendments regarding this issue.
Spring for the 2001 operation related moteros of the groups, although it has been adapted to the penal code, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa pushed for the passage of the Act for the gangsterism.

CCNR the view Mr Dupont and FM 98.1 CHOI his team had the right to express their views, but to specific statements contain "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unfairly negative and crude language of Haitians should not be used in programmes broadcast during the day. "
The Council has also said that the discussions about suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide not violate codes on broadcasting.
CCNR the it had received a number of complaints in relation to comments made at programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint of common front of people who receive social care in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts listed in the issuance were not correct.
Presenters should provide reliable data and not leading to fraud.
In relation to suicide, the one presented Stéphane Dupont said that suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide, should not be seen as a solution to the challenges of life.
"The committee believes that the majority of the episode compromised" DuPont to midi "have sought an emotive issue in a way that is fair and appropriate."
Therefore, in this regard has been binned any blame.
The latest dispute was the statements made in the wake of the earthquake in Haiti.
Then, Stéphane Dufort René Jean Dupont and had instigated a confrontation that had raised numerous reactions in the media.
CHOI the presenter said that it had not conducted any donation to help the Haitians because he could not say with any certainty whether those in need going to actually get the money.
The Committee finds that these comments are not abusive, but the cumulative effect was a representation unduly negative of Haitians.
"I have fulfilled my suspension from three days up there."
"My file is clean for a year and a half ago," said the presenter.
In all decisions, it denounced the release of crude language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI FM had collaborated "even more than what is required."
The impact minimal for the station, which will, among other things, also announce decisions once during peak hours in three days.

In the centre of this deluge of more than a hundred a contract is a consortium of businesses RPGs, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor, which has made a bid on the contract, but more important, to the management of the project by $295 million.
The consortium, named Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision - with Hydro Quebec to trust the private sector responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project $5 billion.

Eastmain's great project leader, Réal Laporte, the Société d'energie of the Baie SEBJ (James) has provided an explanation, which has highlighted the fact that the contract has been awarded the management of the project directly.
Respondes "if a bid, and there are few players, your price is going to be higher."
"You have two choices: You can come in contact with the players in the industry and say: We are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price ."
"However, the idea is that it is not the price, but the power of the people," said the Mr Laporte.
The contract, awarded to a consortium consisting gérance Énergie form part of a long list of more than $50,000 contracts obtained by the Party between.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro - Quebec SEBJ or for draft Sarcelle - Eastmain and 1-A and Rupert.

Barometer of responsible consumption: The label "green," it does not inspire confidence
Environmentally friendly, but deeply sceptical.
Between the consumer trusts actors barely sustainable development, as well as in trademarks of fair trade and organic certification is intended to guide the elections.
Barometer of the responsible consumption, the first results were published yesterday, however, the situation is still worse; the consumer is submerged in a media universe where consumption abound messages advocating a more responsible, but laments the lack of reliable information, and considered that even slowing down your commitment.
Even if there has been an increase in the consumption of products as "socially responsible " in 2010, of Quebec seem to be giving too little credit to those who are trying to sell.
Two thirds say that they do not trust the companies nor environmental commitment to green in advertising the same shows the measurement tool developed by the responsible consumption of the Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: Half of the consumers it casts doubt on the reliability of official certificates that bear products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands which are labels indicating "ecorresponsables " said the Barometer.
In the same way, only 14.6% of Quebec 'is taken seriously by politicians' speeches on this issue.
In any case, information about responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector consumption, supported by nearly a third of consumers, of Quebec.
Fact, the gaps and the questionable nature of the information made 46 per cent of consumers discard this option.
Is the second barrier identified for the barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of those say mistrust of Quebec also alleged returns of products or services that are greening is trying to sell.
Moreover, nearly half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010, and, in particular, changed the brand for one or more products to meet their beliefs.
61 per cent, has given priority to buy the shops of their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in its own region, said the Barometer.
Green most responsible (and responsible consumption index has reached 64 of points out of a maximum 100 this year), to the Quebec Homo consumus loves the position of the king from recycling that is attempting to reduce its impact on the environment by ensuring the protection of wildlife.
However, the barometer, the social awareness that door seems to be (her car) outwards: In 2010, only 28 per cent of those said Quebec that have been used on public transport or car sharing has to defend his principles by environmentalists.
Furthermore, up 39.1 per cent of the participants of this comprehensive survey of conduct, which has just completed its first edit, supports the use of the bike and walking.
A loan for the state regains eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who have been asked to commit financially complex recovery towards cinemas eXcentris Parallèle Angus and the Société, accepting work, but only with a loan.
Société de Développement Parallèle Angus and awaiting a gift seven million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the complex cinematic eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, and return it to its true vocation cinéfila have not received what is called for.
The Government has agreed to get involved in the case, but on their own terms.
Donation instead awaited, the Government of Quebec is a loan in which the amount would, in fact, less than initial expectations; it could be a viable solution at advantageous terms, at least in the eyes of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected an initial plan last spring and a request of $12.8 billion, but since then, those requests had been revised downwards.
President de Développement Société des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, which commands eXcentris file, sent a proposal and a plan of action to the St Pierre.
I sent a final report for a dozen days.
However, received a counterproposal SODEC the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle the Angus and have until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, I believe that it should be ignored completely the possibility of a donation from the state.
Flaubert Owners Association that the cinemas and movie complexes in Quebec is opposed to direct government investment to support the recovering eXcentris, saying that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has done in other cinemas.
At the same time, representatives of industry demanding a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has been ten years in charge of the film in its premises, after finance its own construction, which could justify a waiver by the Council of State.
Rooms lack of independent films is apparent in Montreal, and had managed to entice eXcentris to their clientele.
Parallèle Angus, and the company, led by Christian Yaccarini, pushing for their part in a campaign in private financing, hoping to obtain a foothold for $700,000 toward the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these suites, Parallèle, still casts eXcentris in films.
The goal of future buyers is the reopening next three rooms on February 27, sending the precious film by Xavier Beauvois "Des Hommes et des Congress."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not resumed contact with Le Devoir, and we do not know what you think of him and his group from the proposals that have been received.
The veil rose acomplejado Canada...
The US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regarded as the Canadians with respect to Americans, but to reflect the sense of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
The American diplomats were surprised! That Canadians do not think the voters in the United States / Canada relations when they go to vote and to think that a visit by President Obama to the conservative government he has helped to secure passage of his budget in 2009!
The four emerging communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday that have been made public, offered rather juicy details that really content is substantial.
Cable on 22 September 2008, that is to say, during full federal election campaign, recounts how the United States not enter in the issues discussed by the leaders.
This caused great surprise that the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offered some explanation on this situation.
"Political leaders, probably constrained by an inferiority complex almost inherent to the Canadians to deal with the daily domestic issues, instead of leaving the choice in the United States, and during the campaign over free trade of 1988)," he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is a "proverbial elephant in this election: Omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it. "
The ambassador has yet more problems in understanding the "deafening silence," because the two countries have a strong political and economic ties.
"Naturally, he says, the skills of a candidate, a party, and, most importantly, of the head of a political party in order to manage these essential relationship should be a key factor which should suggest the electorate to vote. "
This can be seen also feeling of importance on cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to President Barack Obama to prepare for their first trip to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the survival of the government during a vote of confidence with early February on the federal budget, in which Canada projected deficit for the first time in the last decade because of a plan for the recovery of millions between 30,000 and 40,000 dollars," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere mentions that the government had extended the parliament before Christmas to avoid that he replace the coalition, or the opposition parties his survival was dependent on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Communication of another January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warning to Washington's increasingly negative image to convey the drama series broadcast on CBC from the United States.
Ambassador was concerned the emission of the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which was conducted shortly Maher Arar subtle references to the "No Fly List - " or even kidnapping to the CIA to conduct vigorous questioning.
Another cable account that, during their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton, asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner that Europe would be willing to accept some of the prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Kouchner said that, yes, but it was "a case."
At the end of the session, they wrote, "has provided documents to the secretary of state regarding Omar Khadr, a Muslim from 15 years of Canadian origin. "
"Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can point to that have warmed up in connection with the Web site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor Stephen Harper, on the CBC radio declared that the massive exodus that is responsible for this should be "shot."
In the United States, echoed Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed a plan for renovation in Cancún for lighting domestic, commercial and industrial sectors in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional cut that needs to be done to stabilize climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan was part of a series of major projects, in particular the UN expected in Cancun to compensate for a lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan, which was submitted yesterday if the incandescent light bulb, which is still among men 50 and 70 per cent of the market for bulbs fluocompactas replaced or, even better, by diode bulbs (DEL electroluminescentes "LED" in Spanish), avoiding much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt GHG) emitted in the world to light up to humans.
Lighting is responsible of 8 per cent of global emissions.
Is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, all major emitters, including the United States, China, Europe, and other countries, including Canada, have pledged voluntary reduction plans to lessen global GHG emissions of 53 Gt Gt to 49.
However, it should be reduced that sum still 5 Gt to stabilize before 2020, an increase in global temperatures to two degrees centigrade in order to avoid a spiral out of control.
Incandescent lightbulbs in, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated in heat, and the rest is to say, an increase of 5 per cent, generates light.
In the case of those bulbs fluocompactas, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75 per cent and with new LED lamps, still more than twice the energy consumption.
CFL fluocompactas lasts an average of between 6 and 10 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that have been put in place by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the survey by the UN), and have a life expectancy of 25 hours and consume up to 80 percent less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives us a good idea of the savings that can be achieved to the replacement plan would be implemented in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also operate with very little heat reóstatos and emit.
Above, do not contain any mercury.
Specialists have expressed reservations regarding fluocompactas bulbs, which contain mercury and they should be eliminated as hazardous waste, which it is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers affix instructions.
However, the report notes, the largest source of mercury emissions in the world were no bulbs fluocompactas, but coal fired power plants, which emit a large quantity of mercury to produce the electricity wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the advantages this international programme in each country.
Indonesia, for example, in this way would save about $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 - equivalent to 3.5 and heating stations whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks eagerly awaiting the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, has called for the publication "immediately " on the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, as deadlines have slipped.
"The Secretary General stressed the need for independent electoral commission would complete its work and immediately announce the interim results," says a spokesman for the head of the UN.
"Calls on all parties in Ivory Coast and the institutions who show a sense of responsibility, and to refrain from any move until the interim results to be announced. "
Despite pressure from several foreign governments, and the elections commission has failed to shift the deadline of midnight on Wednesday to publish the results without having been three days since the election on Sunday.
Approximately 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of the Commonwealth, on television he had said that the commission "still working " to announce the results.
Wednesday have multiplied in the world, calls for the IEC says finally the name of the winner of the second round, from the outgoing President Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo camp with the cancellation by the Constitutional Council votes "dishonest" in the north, in the hands of the former rebel New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the campaign by the president of Ivory Coast, has argued that the tactics of intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country have kept the outgoing president " s supporters to go vote.
Any election would be nullified if the Constitutional Council accepts complaints by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of Gbagbo felt that the country's highest court will not be neutral because it is led by Paul N'Dré as Yao, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man in the north who denies any links with the former rebels, has tried to be "unacceptable " for the delay in the publication of the election results and has called on Gbagbo respects, but it has not gone so far as to lay claim to the victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo has blocked the publication of the results, because he knows that he has lost and to complain to the Constitutional Council, after the election commission blocked the broadcast of results, it would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday, was to have been the icing to the reunification process and reconciliation to a country divided into two years ago.
United Nations have warned on Wednesday to the political class from Ivory Coast who could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended in the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who was publicly supported by former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Matter Clotilde Reiss: The exaggerated Eliseo had Syrian mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destinies of Clotilde Reiss, a French investigating the girl arrested in Iran for "espionage ," has been in thrall to the public in France, has been alerted for diplomacy and has contributed to the deterioration of the relationship between Tehran and Paris.
All under the watchful eye of United States diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde to reveal unknown aspects of this crisis.
Eliseo had described how to explain his strategy for the Americans to the point of giving them advice on how to manage its own crisis of "hostages" on a small group of (Iran senderistas).
French shows that those responsible attempted to convince Washington of the liberation of the young French woman was not released in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and is wanted by the US justice system for traffic of materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, show the stark reality of how a French presidency sought to manipulate the media to give the idea that the president of the Syrian, Bachar Assad, he had played a key role in securing the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, he did nothing.
A diplomatic cable written on August 12, 2009, in Paris called "Iran: That French comments on how to handle cases of hostage."
Eliseo s adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the governor at the Quai d'Orsay to north Africa and the Middle East, is Patrice Paoli, speaking to the US diplomatic Allegrone Kathleen.
I explained the method the French.
Advise the Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens are forcibly held in Iran.
Noise "do," they say, a "continuously Soltad" in the media, the words' fundamental human rights ,"" Innocence ,"" immediate release. "
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, his careful image.
"I ask that when Iranians paréis, hacedlo still more frequently ."
Because once exhausted channels by discreet attempts at negotiation, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "experts at delaying tactics."
Mr Richier added that the detention of foreign nationals is "an usual Iranian tactics: The taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announced that the release from detention of Clotilde Reiss, to take place on 16 August, when he will be hiding at the French embassy "will require payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros reward).
In addition, he said the other hostage crisis prefigures Eliseo, a phenomenon that is "going to increase."
Iranians could be "in the near future to curb another of the roughly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison following twelve days, but it is blocked in Iran.
Be broadcast following information: The Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request by the United States for smuggling of sensitive electronic material to Iran, had been released in Paris by the decision of a judge.
The US embassy, along with many observers doubt the odd coincidence.
In Washington, some clandestine Iranian procurement networks of equipment for its nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Should France agreed an exchange?
Releasing what to change Iranian to the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September that François Richier guarantees was not the case.
Eliseo on, she says, not only "hugely surprised by the judge's decision," but he has tried to resist.
"There were some tough negotiations between the presidency and the Ministry of Justice" (at the time, to Michèle Alliot Marie), but "The French government could not overrule the decision" of the court, he said.
Richier Mr Majid Kakavand also wants to demonstrate that he remains under "close 'monitoring of the French intelligence services.
Eliseo brand the advisor of a phone number, hang them, and later, reported to the American that the Iranian diplomat, "is now in some Paris buildings operated by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, not sparing in Eliseo, and reported using leaks to the media in order to make people believe that the Syrian President Bachar Assad have played a part in the "large" and "influential." Of a "mediator."
Americans observed that activity with some irony brings, and check that the fruit, as several news articles they convey the official version of the French.
A telegram dated August 25 2009 says "the 'Blitz' story of the French officers."
Why this is such a "gratitude" to Mr Assad, wondered the embassy in Paris.
"Despite its statements full of praise, the French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague idea of what it has actually done the Syrians."
The document addresses the reasons that have led the US to lead in Eliseo this fiction.
The major effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening toward Syria," he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, that "in the opinion of many critics in France and abroad, just be criticized as premature and desmerecida ."
To "exaggerate the Syrian role," Paris is trying "to show Syria the praise that can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran. "
US embassy as she knows good source.
On 11 August, François Richier I trusted: "Naturally, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we have been grateful for that."
"At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy by Eliseo the recipient.
In a statement, he thanked the president of Brazil, that Syrian and Senegal had played an "active role in support of the release of our compatriot,."
Starting midnight - young Koreans cannot play on the line.
The South Korean Government is going to take a bill called the "Cinderella" which prevents adolescents participate in online gaming after midnight to block their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December, submit a bill to parliament to ask the companies online games to block access to gambling after midnight to young people under the age of 16, as they told representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children playing all night, and later, they found it difficult to study in school and leading a normal life during the day. "
"We think that this bill is necessary to protect their health as well as your right to sleep," he told the AFP by Jo Rhine, for ministerial responsibility for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government is also asking companies to limit their access time to these games, when the parents of the young women, as well as request, adding the person responsible.
In addition, it is going to make available to anyone who requests it free software to limit their time connecting to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the world's most "wired" and the newspapers are regularly on news developments linked to a heavy reliance on the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of online global competitions of games.
In November, South Korea, won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where he faced other 58 countries.
World Cup 2018 / 2022: FIFA the organizing country appoints
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee appointing the country Thursday, organizers Cups of 2018 and 2022 in the world, a clearly political choice where the struggles of the lobbying and influence and can override to reach technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional stronghold of the discipline (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spain / Portugal and Netherlands / Belgium.
2022 edition is much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia, after a debut in the African continent in 2010, or to proceed with its introduction in the United States or in the Far East, Japan, South Korea).
The list of public figures who were part of delegations (David Cameron and Prince William - José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to José Socrates, Bill Clinton, in the Qatari emir, the head of the Belgian government and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the political and economic interests at play in a World Cup.
Transactions between scenes, therefore, it is likely to last until the final minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA report evaluating, English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) possess the best arguments to their competitors.
However, such considerations will not be too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, who is responsible of the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of the EC (two members Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, and the opportunities that might have ruined his country, home of football, only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday, by disseminating a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the European Commission (EC), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Upset enough to embarrass FIFA and British officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks as David Cameron at the helm.
Government hopes replicate successful the coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London 2012's organising JJ.OO..
This intensive activity, may be enough to restore the luster of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the duo also Spain and Portugal, with numerous stadium through their strengths, ready your experience (in Spain 82 World Cup, 1992 Barcelona JJ.OO, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and the football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries, could thwart their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English, and questions about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only points to lead Russia, into a heavyweight outsider, despite loopholes in its bid (stadiums, hotels and transport).
However, the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, has decided not to go to Zurich, and has complained about an "unfair competition in preparation for the vote " in an allusion to accusations against members of the English press.
"are raked up their dirty linen, attempting comprometerles," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, who have the experience of 1994, more logical favourites seem.
Early global economic power and the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seemed to take advantage to Japan and South Korea, which has developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new applications appear premature to two countries that have been held together the tournament in 2002.
Another risk: 2026 the World Cup in China, strongly desired by FIFA, which is that Asia would be no chance for 2022.
Together with Qatar, who has submitted his proposed stadia on futuristic, and Australia will continue FIFA with its expansion to new horizons, but the two countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, as do Japan and Korea, there might also be damaged by weak TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war on the FIFA.
Second term: Proof
De Gaulle really had doubted.
Mitterrand had intimated that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest doubt.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less.
Eliseo a mandate in the leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state, he will be a candidate in 2012.
However, the tests did not combine well with the mystery, which is usually associated with the presidential role.
Therefore, we must always be seen to be clear.
To one side and the other.
In 2006, although I do not believe, the friend of Jacques Chirac claimed that neither a third term.
15 November, into serious tone, as President Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "sometime in the fall of 2011. "
Hence the fact that deals with MPs from the UMP, Tuesday evening in Eliseo, "two terms" has caused a stir.
Are deals of the official announcement of his candidacy?
Much less.
The president only indicated that constitutional reform in 2008, limited to two terms of five years.
Merely conveying facts, not an advert.
It is not the first time that talk of the presidential vote, with a humorous note, events of this kind.
"In the worst, or the best, those cases, seven and a half years still pasaréis me ," was released in July 2009.
Another occasion, in May 2010: "I am not not penséis that what comes after it."
His assertions on Monday she was not closer to the nomination, or even less.
Raise comments for two reasons.
Acceleration in the race for the nomination into the Socialist Party (PS), on the one hand.
But it is not the fact of Ségolène Royal, which has risen to prominence leading to confide to Nicolas Sarkozy.
Rather to the contrary, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is not obvious is what leads so many people to the PS to claim that the battle earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad poll.
For the first time, voters prefer to wing for the nomination of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy - the 46 per cent to 44 per cent, according to a BVA / L'Express.
"We need a candidate of the UMP, and there is no discussion on the topic," has reacted cautiously and the immediate surroundings of the Prime Minister.
"If it thinks that it can lose, it will not be a candidate," believes Mr Raffarin.
"I always think we can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned in the face of the evidence.
Euro: The ECB was forced to maintain its procurement of government Bills
The latest meeting of the Board of governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) should be allowed to specify the ways out of the crisis, or at least, advertising the breakdown of a large number of operations not conventional monetary policy should be completed by the end of the year.
Because the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the Frankfurt institution issuing certainly could not afford to be so compelling if you do not want to risk aggravating a situation more complicated today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has underpinned the ECB by the active role played in favor of the solution to the debt crises of the European states.
Did not want to say whether he believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans'...
The previous day, in Brussels, in a hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean Claude Trichet, was not the most eloquent in terms of their intentions, pointing out only that the programme of buying of government Bills in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will have to wait and see what is decided" over Thursday " s meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1 per cent, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the European Central Bank last week doubled to reach nearly 1.35 billion euros.
Moreover, according to the operators indiscretos the market yesterday, it would have bought the securities again Irish and Portuguese.
In total, the central banks of the euro system have acquired title for an amount of EUR 67 million from May 2010.
Among operators in the market, not the slightest doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Those economists not foresee any significant changes of direction.
Although lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still unlimited liquidity allocation to beneficial terms and with lengths, which varied between one week and three months.
Economists expect today is run this device for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that will significantly alter its agenda."
"If not, you run the risk of provoking more tension in the short term," said Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"It appears likely that there will be a gradual exit was announced during the first quarter of 2011, " prefigures Bräms Norbert on his part, analyst at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Compared with interventions in the market, the public debt, "the ECB should have a caseload of purchase of those obligations so that the market will remain stable," added Norbert Bräms.
Bearing in mind the importance of those exhibitions of European banks to the markets, sovereign debts in the euro zone, not the institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"Price must compensate for any lack of investors in the market and acting in a way that would prevent a sharp rise in the returns paid on the most fragile states," opined yesterday an important bond manager.
Because if interest rates were through the roof, the United States will have even more difficult to reduce its debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the temporary
After Italy has begun the week in a way that is eerie, the situation has improved slightly yesterday with the undertow of the types of the debentures to 10 years.
Precarious calm of a recovery.
Leaving a meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have claimed that regional presidents had heard to Giulio Tremonti described the situation as "unfathomable " and that they are hoping for a weekend" unpredictable ," contradicted statements subsequently by the parties.
In any case, on Tuesday, the rate gap with the rest German long term to have reached a record 210 basis points to the price of hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had jumped to 263.0 points, causing a fuss in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers - Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain the gap with the rest German rates were exceeding 400 basis points.
But her right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned " by" the turmoil in the markets and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that in Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is such as Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, his problem is the lack of growth and income stagnation associated with the same, which means that the state is at risk of not being able to meet their funding needs.
Brussels forecasts the latest have been a heavy blow to the government.
Italian growth was estimated to reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 2012 of 1.4 per cent, while the budget is being debated in the Senate, it is based on a few numbers of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
In these terms, according to the European Commission, the budget deficit will be 4.3 per cent in GDP next year, compared to the 3.9 per cent predicted by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012, instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumours that can be applied to further budgetary provisions after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 million.
"In case of need, we must adopt new austerity measures," said the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the moment Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of the economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager of the International Monetary Fund held responsible for Italy at the IMF.
'There is no immediate challenge in either the short or long term, because despite its substantial debt (119.2 percent of GDP in 2011 NDLR) stabilization efforts requested to Italy are children that required the other countries, " said Pier Carlo Padoan, the chief economist of the OECD.
Is the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi, will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, could anticipate that after the elections at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be a period that is not conducive to the decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening the mechanisms to combat the crisis.
Christine Lagarde has already repeated yesterday at a press conference in Paris, said: "I believe that we have already shown on Sunday evening and the date, that Europeans are clearly sympathetic, decisive, determined to defend its currency and the euro zone."
Although was dealing, the easing seen yesterday at the kinds of States obligations has prompted European governments and the ECB.
"However, we cannot yet talk of a standardisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it might lower the ratings of debt of Portugal, the most common target of speculation today.
"Like in May, there is a lack of clarity and transparency policies really, which weighs significantly on their banking systems, " the economists view Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially as "the political pace is far slower than the speed of the markets ."
Well aware of this gap and risks lurking, the discussions intensified European countries to strengthen existing way out of the crisis.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, along with their G20 counterparts were on the right track.
And also taking into account that the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the order of the day, this kind of unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone at market colimador (see above).
As the European Financial Stability Fund (FEEF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday in Singapore has embarked on a tour of Asia to inform investors in the Far East on the developments of the ongoing crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of the visits was not fundraising, without doubt preparing the ground.
Emissions are expected to be the first to be conducted FEEF of titles the next month.
Yesterday, a US official assigned to the Reuters news agency that the United States would support a potential rise of the funds through additional direct commitment to the IMF.
Regarding the countries who are in the first line; Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to embrace structural reforms, particularly in connection with the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms were added those austerity measures with an effect that is closest.
Lisbon and Madrid wants to move to a different road followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs to seek international aid before implementing their own corrections budget and decide that they consider essential structural reforms to increase the confidence in a sustainable manner.
Capitalist partners from European funds, and, finally, there are options to accelerate the process of normalizing the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to drop the idea that, if the estimated 750,000 38.8 million euros for Europe, and the International Monetary Fund was not enough, the European Union would not hesitate to return to remove the portfolio.
Barclays Capital economists, a frontline player in the market for government debt in Europe, consider that an amount of about $100 million of additional euros would be insufficient, " preferably " in the form of direct infusion of liquidity.
There is a tool to do so: The European mechanism for financial stabilization, with 60 million euros.
A council that, no doubt, could detail of the European capitals.
Especially if conditions worsen for the market.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snow are causing difficulties of movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect a range of economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are orange warning due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure (et / Loir, Deux and Sèvres Vienne and have joined 20 departments were already at orange alert, from eighteen and a half day on Wednesday at two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, joined the group for the night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow falls, affecting north of Gironde and Charente, but also slight snow in Isla de France.
Expect some snow cover for between 2 and 5 cm, punctually of between 7 and 10 centimetres, in the departments concerned and of between 1 and 3 cm, or even 5 centimetres, in the Paris region.
Charente is affected departments, and Charente Maritime, Côtes d Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and regions of Lower Normandy, Isla Lemosín and France.
Snowfall are strong enough to cause problems with circulation and certain economic activities affect, warning Météo France.
In the Côtes d Armor, has been denied access to several departmental road heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including axes Guingamp-Lannion Loudéac Saint Brieuc and Democrats.
According to the gendarmes, the movement in Britain is complicated secondary network, which will not be recommending that, except in the case of need, and it has banned the movement of certain vehicles EST during the day.
During last Thursday, school transport has been prohibited in Picardy.
Was not anticipated any specific measure on Wednesday evening, to curtail the movement of heavy vehicles.
Prefectural "urged all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and to adjust their driving to the situation ."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked the airlines Thursday to withdraw up to 25 per cent of its flights at Paris airport Roissy and Orly in 10 per cent as a result of the predicted snowfall.
DGAC recommends to air passengers are advised to contact their airline.
In Britain's Gatwick airport, south of London and of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are being closed until Thursday morning.
Subway of Grand Paris: Financial first drafts
Since the debate on revamping the transportation at the Island of France has reached its peak, fell the billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we are talking of the 23 billion to the subway of Grand Paris must construct Société du Grand Paris.
GSP to launch this, the Government has announced a fund allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical level, the amount that would allow then to the SGP borrow money in the markets to fund a part of a double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first place.
Amendment of the Finance Act of 2010, which was reviewed in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, includes the expected device to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: The creation of a special tax and rising equipment tax offices in the Isle de France.
The first, according to Article 15 read the text of the bill, is "in the best interest of the public body that Société du Grand Paris ."
Addition, is in the numbers: "the proceeds of the levy is $117 billion per year ."
The second is a change in tax offices one which already exists "to modernize, improve their product and put the increase for the Société du Grand Paris ."
How much you'll get with this approach?
Who knows.
In the text gave no figures.
4 billion, but it is far from it.
"It is clear that the fiscal resources are in addition to the €4 billion of the funds that will mobilize to the State and to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progressed," can read in the explanatory statement.
The GSP is not surprised with this system.
"From the moment they are created income (the two taxes ndlr), can meet for three years and then to receive $4 billion more later, as we explained."
"I will be in the budget, and will be on the basis of need."
The GSP empecerá to receive estimated $4 billion to the budget in 2013 to 2014.
This device, which does not include pledged $4 billion in credit, could lead to a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Skillful hacker revenge and spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand apparently uncovered a scandal, a scandal that only seems to outrage at the hypocrisy that governs relations between the state, citizens and the press.
At the same time, announced sweeping changes on an international level and expects a future dominated by the downturn.
But to go step by step.
The first prong of WikiLeaks is an affirmation of the fact that each individual file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which he belongs) consists exclusively of clippings.
"'extraordinary revelations concerning American sexual mores of Berlusconi only reflect what has been over the past few months writing in any newspaper, except those belonging to Berlusconi and the ominous Khadafi ridiculizador profile carries a lot of time giving ideas to the cabaret artists for his sketches.
The standard whereby the records secret should only comprise news public knowledge is essential to the drive of the secret services - and not just in this new century.
If visiting a bookstore on esoteric literature, as each piece will be repeated (on the grail, the mystery - Château de Rennes and kicked, the Templars Rosacruz or is) exactly what was written in the earlier works.
This is due not only to the fact that the authors do not occult unpublished research they want to do (or not know where to seek updates from little), but because of those who are devoted to the unaccountability not just rely on what you already know, which reconfirmed what we have learned.
This is the mechanism on the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The informant is idler, idler is like (or lust) is low, the head of the secret services - if not it could be, I do not know, the editor of Libération, which only sees what some can recognise.
Berlusconi the top secret information on which the United States Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was in Newsweek published the same as the previous week.
Then why the revelations have caused such a fuss in these files?
On the one hand, just telling us what any person under cultivation now knows, namely that US embassies, at least since World War II and since heads of state can be called on the phone, or take the plane to meet for dinner, and its diplomatic role had lost, apart from a few years of limited representation, have become hubs of espionage.
Any viewer who sees movies of research you know, just as we do not know by aparentamos hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact publicly say it infringes the duty and gives hypocrisy a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a secret can consult the Hacker any more secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a major impact on the credibility of the Department of State.
Hence, the scandal affect both victims and the "executioner."
But go to the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly Brother at the time, could be seen to full power as a Big Brother he controls every gesture of their subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been a reality since who could control every movement, thanks to phone, every transaction conducted, visited the hotel, a highway and taken the man turned into a complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when it turns out, as is happening now, or even the secrets criptas of power cannot escape the clutches of a Hacker, the unidirectional and control becomes becomes circular.
Controls the power to every citizen, every citizen, but at least the Hacker, who was elected as the avenger of the people) can learn all the secrets of power.
How can power cut that no longer can or even retain their own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, secrecy is a true vacuum (secret a secret and a vacuum would never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel's secret is actually a void without secrecy, which comes from the public sphere, but revealing, as WikiLeaks, as secrets secret were loopholes mean Hillary Clinton blunted any power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but it does, and a lot to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of such an injury caused by a power so strong?
It is clear that, in the future, the United States will no longer be able to put on the network no classified information, and that it would be published at a poster on the street.
But it is also clear that, with modern technology, it could not be expected to keep the talks confidential by telephone.
Nothing is easier to discover whether and when a head of state has visited in an aircraft and has been in contact with one of his peers.
How able to maintain in the future to be private and confidential relations?
I know that, for the time being, my forecast is something out of science fiction, and therefore novelesca, but I guess that government agents to move discreetly on proceedings with uncontrollable movements, carrying messages of remembrance have been learnt, or as much, some hiding data written on the heels of their shoes.
Such information then is stored in a single copy, in crates locked: At the end of the day, trying to spy the Watergate that WikiLeaks was less successful.
In the past I have written that the technology currently is moving as a crab, it is said, turned back.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has become to raise with a telegraph cables (the telephone).
Video tapes (analog) had allowed researchers to study the cinema a film been step by step, move forward and backwards, to uncover the secrets to all assembly, while now that the CD (digital) just to make progress or regress chapter by chapter, it is said, to huge proportions.
With high speed trains, that we can go to Milan to Rome to three hours, and in the plane, to travel that entails, we need the three and a half hours.
Hence is nothing out of the ordinary that policy and communication techniques lead us once again to the car horse.
A final comment.
The past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly tramaba embassies.
At present, there are embassies calling the confidential information to the press.
Climate -- the bungling of France on their funding pledges
One year following the Copenhagen Agreement, it was time to consider whether it has complied with the promises of funding quickly unlocked (called "fast start and early) made by developed countries.
Were revealed and the bungling French.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed nations pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged to provide 7.2 billion euros in three years and France €1.26 billion (ie, $420 million for the year).
COP16 during the opening of the the EU has put on the table their best to convince their partners of his commitment to the "fast start funding it is real: A report detailing measures of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, distribution of leaflets...
Meaningful and transparent result of the operation, he was appreciated for what it really is: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries do the same and to the same accuracy level.
Announced that it has released the EU €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it in the right direction towards fulfilling its pledge of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that they make a complementary effort, without encumbering to official development aid.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach an agreement on what it means to "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some member states, including France, have blocked the suit.
Nowadays, each which selects the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference to the year 2009 - remains with international financing and would add $150 million over three years in funding fast start.
Other countries elected were similar references for the year, or the level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France sees the financing "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous year and the total level of official development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of aid to developing countries, it could remain stable or even decline) while respecting his commitment to funding "new and additional,..."
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there are no rules and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, who believe that every euro given amounts to one euro has been donated.
Clearly, it is hard to justify: The effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified in certain investments (often who are profitable, and projects related to emissions reduction technologies that are more effective, it is misleading to present one euro that is going to recover and is equivalent to one euro to be... It donates much, only to be counted for their commitment to the cost of borrowing for the country, which the loan (that is to say, the equivalent of a rate of interest).
But France is not useful as logic: "respected " its commitment of 420 million euros by a percent of loans (91.5 389.90 million euros) and a 8.5% of donations ($36.1 billion euros); consult the EU document to see with their own eyes.
Is the only country in the European Union that used so frequently the loan.
Germany uses it by 46 per cent, while in Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among other things, to abide by their commitments, with an 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union makes a euro to meet its commitment, France only provides 10 cents and said that efforts must be comparable.
One neat trick!!
In summary, in funding fast start, France conducted a dual use: On the one hand, in relation to the action at the time, and, in relation to the real financial drain.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, can give the impression that they have to spend 420 billion "new and additional," as he had promised.
Handling of the Ministry of Finance, is because it appears that he has occupied of the Bercy arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were all the other member states to continue donating when they can simply pay it?) and in the negotiations, as developing countries are not stupid...
Chapter of early funding is peanuts, relatively short period of time, in relation to the climate negotiations.
But it could be a bit more in the vast machinery is the UNFCCC.
I hope that is not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of funding.
First France could announce a change in the method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect their commitments and the same way that other countries of the European Union.
But, notably, France could be advanced that discussions on wagers at stake in relation to the funding in the long term (a key chapter currently being debated) will not get rid of the issue's "additionality," or method to compute their loans.
France could change their position in order to be as progressive in connection with this matter as it is to others.
Thus, we can only hope the new Environment Minister, Mrs and Kosciusko Morizet to Cancun next week.
Announcement surprised the fast start for France and its vision of the "additional " and uses of the loans would help improve the standard of international confidence needed to move forward on negotiations.
Warnings on pesticides eaten by the children.
10 years to have a child one day consumed in different chemicals 81, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement by the rights and respect of the future generations).
Partnership, who warned that the results "did not have a meaningful statistical value in light of the limited numbers of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problems raised," purchased at supermarket Oise and Paris between July and September which typically consume food with a child of about 10 years, and one snack into four meals a day.
These meals taken as a model, that uphold the official recommendations (five portions of fruits and vegetables, three dairy and about 1.5 litres of water a day, as well as sweets, were studied in laboratories searching for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
Stock of the bowl is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogenic substances classified as carcinogens or five insurance, as well as 37 substances, which could act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to the study of various institutions like the International Center for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, is not exceeded the legal limits for each of the individual chemicals, our survey shows clearly that consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and EP / or are cause for concern," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered as carcinogenic insurance, as well as nearly a dozen rubbish that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The product, imported from Brazil, which had been scheduled as the bar to snack contains trace amounts of six chemicals, a fungicide included banned in France.
The same should apply to the green beans from Kenya, which is included in the meal, where the survey has identified traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
Addition, the steak, and even canned tuna or a loaf of bread they were chewing gum aderezados with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, tests uncovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the diner, the slice of salmon was more "nutritious" detected chemical residues with 34 or even analysis of the bowl of plastic used to heat food in the microwave is not entirely clean.
The final risk generated by these "cocktails of contaminants" to the consumer "probably undervalued," said the study.
Europe Ecology Alliance - Les Verts (EE / LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the seriousness of the situation" to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halting "the rise in diseases linked to civilisation ."
In July, a study in the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) had indicated the presence of residues of pesticides that have been identified in the 365 different fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of whom 76 on cereals.
