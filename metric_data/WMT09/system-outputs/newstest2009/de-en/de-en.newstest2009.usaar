The Prague Stock Exchange falls against closing time into the minus. 
To the sharp waste on the morning the Prague Stock Exchange could correct the losses. 
The transactions with the shares of reached nearly half the normal requirements. 
The Prague Stock Exchange picked up now the burglary of the Monday, when it sank around further six percentage points, at the beginning of the Tuesday businesses. 
This time the reason for the collapse was urgent Wall Street. 
Also in Czech Republic the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American representative house which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector is proved so. 
Case of the shares in Asia 
The stocks experienced a dramatic case on Tuesday at the stock markets in Asia although the indexes could balance a part of the losses in the course of the day. 
The index of inclination Seng stock exchange in Hong Kong lost in the course of the business day almost four points, could wettmachen, however, later a part of the losses, thus the drop was reduced on around 2.5 percent. 
The index inclination Seng China of Enterprises that observes the movement of the Chinese stocks at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, sank around 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai the markets were locked. 
The stocks at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five per cent, reduced, however then the losses on 4.3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan sank according to the local index 3.6 percent. 
"this timing for the rescue operation in the United States is unsure and becomes the financial markets worldwide influence", so the chief of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong determines his monetary policy itself, therefore independent of the Chinese central bank, although it belongs to China. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong move on the same level as those in the United States. 
The American legislators should return onto the negotiating table according to words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as quickly as possibly and adopt the draft for the support of the financial system. 
Otherwise it threatens that also other countries would be affected from the slump. 
A bloodbath American shares 
The US House of Representatives refused on Monday the plan for a relief of the financial system which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion K) should be spent for. 
The legislators ignored so the request of president George Bush to support the plan. 
According to Bush's view the plan would control the fundamental causes for the financial crisis and help thus with stabilizing the entire economy. 
The American shares experienced on Monday a bloodbath, and the most important share indexes recorded the biggest slump in more than 20 years ago. 
The Dow Jones index sank around nearly seven per cent, it had last in 1987 recorded a similar slump. 
The index had already before the vote sunk, however, there were hardly signs for the draft not coming through in the House of Representatives the index experienced a free fall. 
Congress does concession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks 
The supreme representative of the American Congress and the government of president George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement about financial aid for the American financial system. 
That is supposed to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in conversations about the discharge of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the American financial system in an extent of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns). 
However, this does not mean no victory. 
The congress representatives must negotiate indeed still some details of the agreement before they may publish the final version of the law and vote on that. 
The plan to support the financial system is discussed on Monday in the US Congress. 
On Sunday the chairman of the committee on said this to Barney Frank of the Reuters agency news for banking and financial services. 
In the Senate the plan could be voted on according to different information probably at the earliest on Wednesday. 
According to economists a communication should be the first significant psychological factor over the plan being adopted for a revival of the financial markets. 
After that it is attributed, however, one "disenchantment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as one could help the markets also in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"we have achieved a significant step forward. 
We clarified our different views to how a parcel for to stabilise the market is supposed to look "the Democrat said to Nancy Pelosi opposite the agency certain. 
According to their words it could result still on Sunday in a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislature met the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in the night for Sunday in order to give its final form to the government fund. 
This plans an Abkauf of unmerchandisable Hypothekenaktiva of the financial undertakings which fling the financial undertakings into heavy losses and endanger stability of the entire system. 
"we to stand on the fringe of a definitive agreement about a plan that will function and that must be also effective on the market. 
one must continue the recovery plan still further, however, I think we are at the destination "so Paulson. 
A signal for Asia businesses 
The global financial crisis suppresses also clearly in the share markets which sink strongly. 
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid the legislators are called in for reaching still before Sunday in Congress to a final agreement. 
In this way one wants to calm indeed the investors in front of shops on the Asian financial markets who lie in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could influence the business on Monday. 
Up to now, however, it is not yet very clear when both chambers of the American congress will vote on the law, also there is problem over whether nevertheless the negotiations in a last minute way could not fail because of a problem yet. 
The legislators hope for its being adopted in the next few days. 
The law but, will undergo some changes. 
The total amount determined to To help for the system is supposed to be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars are supposed to be set as quickly as possibly readily as president George Bush required. 
The congress can block, however, the filling of the remaining money if he has the impression that the programme does not fulfill his function and indeed at further 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush evaluates progress positively in negotiations 
The president has a veto indeed with this decision, however the Congress can outvote his veto. 
In spite of these changes the basic idea of the programme that was based on attaining budgets for the Abkauf of bad mortgage bonds that value fell kept on, however, existing because hundreds are not Americans anymore in the situation to pay back their mortgages. 
"we everything have elaborated. 
The House of Representatives should be in the situation to vote on the law on Sunday the senate then at the Monday ", so the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
In a satisfied way with the progress the American President Bush showed himself. 
His speaker Tony Fratto declared, Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "he estimates the bothering on both sides, to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy". 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The chairperson of the banking committee of the senate Christopher Dodd the chief negotiators, made announce the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a time pattern for the financing of the plan. 
The new law is supposed to restrict also the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the societies, which are participated in the program and employs a committee that is supposed to be of the supervision in charge about the fund. 
the Treasury is supposed to route this. 
"we have worked very hard at that and a big step forward in direction of an agreement achieves, that one functioned and important for the market and for all Americans is", so Paulson. 
The plan reckons also an aid for houseowners who have problems with the repayment its mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new installments with mortgages which she buys up at which the aim consists in lowering the monthly costs for the debtors and making to keep their homes for them possible. 
Marek: psychological help 
The suggested plan is a good idea after the chief economist of Patria under David Marek, however, the implementation becomes very difficult. 
"and therefore indeed, because one does not know through what mechanism and around what price the problematic assets are bought up. 
That will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide up the losses between under each other ", Marek said this week the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan now or at the beginning of next week is adopted is not according to Mareks opinion decisive. 
"a lot of more important it is, that the Congress agree on that, the plan to support and that they adopt it as quickly as possibly. 
The psychological importance of the agreement on its resulting in an adoption is the most important thing in this moment ", Marek stressed. 
Duel on a knife-edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you during your choice 
While nearly every mobile phone is can play MP3 - files yet not MP3 player can phone. 
Therefore that it is better to be bought only a telephone it looks of course like this. 
For all that there are sufficiently reasons for why one should adopt an independent Player. 
The election completely hangs from the type of use and the demands the future owner. 
Surely one scarcely buys oneself for at home a fabulous expensive phonograph, in order to listen to the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on that. 
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is not also any objective reason for that. 
If you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelf, however, you dream probably at least about one like that. 
That also with the music is like this on journeys, therefore with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. 
Also here there are price and quality categories. 
For one it is not maybe acceptable to spend eight thousand kronor for a Player, in the same way a Pink - Floyd - fan will presumably scarcely verkraften, however headphones on for twenty crowns the market. 
Two extremes between which there is for every sufficient room. 
The selection is widely diversified. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is decisive. 
Some good Music Player can play music much more than only, however that, what mobile phones can, they do not get not even in outline. 
No modern equipment is to be used as universally as the telephone is. 
Next to the primary functions, the making a call and that ledges, it can display music and videos, to record both it has a better once, once a worse camera and can navigate maybe also. 
And if one includes still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grill and not to photograph no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones brings also disadvantages with themselves. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequently you will have to re-load it, however. 
And that of music is one of the largest everything. 
Only a few phones can music longer when ten - to play twelve hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect are to music player (specifically the simplest) clearly stronger. 
Therefore you should reckon near cheap mobile phones their not being able to play music longer as a few hours. 
If you phone then now and then still, you buy a loader more with pleasure still for the safety for office - that is valid also for more expensive equipment. 
At MP3 players you will not have this problem, to hold also that one less good at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with a time To Load from. 
Another problem exists then if one wants to re-record the music onto on mobile phone. 
Unfortunately only a small part of the equipment has a USB - end, in addition every mobile phone without special software can not be connected directly to a PC. 
Of course one can re-record the music directly onto a storage medium, nevertheless only few reading equipment card becomes without reduction with the tiny memory cards ready, that are used in mobile phones. 
At players you do not need no special software apart from exceptions (iPod). 
You need to feed the device with music only above USB - port from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and Player create even a music library, arranged according to the name of the performers, the title of the album, the pointed or for example the assessment by users. 
Some devices show only the tree network of the symbolic address table, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Player are easier to help oneself mobile phones can more 
You should ask the selection of a specific appliance in particular about the service life of the accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the model of the sound and of course also the operating convenience. 
If particularly backdrop is music for you and if you hear it every day only briefly for example in the trams, an arbitrary Handy which plays MP3 - files suffices then. 
What real almost every mobile phone can. 
You do not have to control either particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a Player can process. 
MP3 create all of them, and most music which you get will be just in this format. 
The format appertains to the most spread, and in addition the majority equipment can play also music in the WMA - format. 
AAC is less usual (to use (a format, that Apple and his iPods). 
Better mobile phones facilitate also the purchase of music in an online way. 
One needs to call the corresponding pages of a Providers (or any other provider) only about mobile Internet, and already one can gain a song or album. 
This service can be already at and for itself a beating argument for why one should adopt a Musikhandy. 
Unfortunately this supply of providers is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast broadcast hits. 
The prices are not the lowest either. 
Generally, however, one assumes just this kind of the sale of music (it is over GSM, Internet or radio-controlled Internet) in future dominating the music industry. 
Most bear the mobile phone with themselves. 
if you have inclination to listen to something, you grasp the mobile phone in the pocket while to forget is suiting to the Player at home. 
It depends, however, on whether you ever bear headphones or at least a radio-controlled hands-free equipment with yourself. 
Otherwise, you can access to the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phone has, however only the least MP3 players. 
The presumably greatest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest taste normally less than three thousand kronor. 
for three - and you already get four thousand kronor a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are. 
The best and technically advanced telephones with a for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player lies in turn in the slight serving. 
The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest (see selection) - everyone can help itself Player real. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity during the serving with that formerly normal cassette recorder or for example the phonograph is obvious. 
It no collision in the form of an erroneously done mobile Internets and one threatens then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
the device should one grasp now 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) have normally a slot for exchangeable storage medium (Model M2, microSD and similar things. 
Even if you buy a proper card two thousand kronor suffice. 
However, respect. 
Only cards with a maximum capacity are normally supported in the basis models by 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8 - GB memory cards. 
If you own have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap mp3 player, you catch Emgeton then after cowons, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, or iriver. 
According to capacity (maximally. 2 GB) you must put then not more than 1100 crowns onto the table. 
You belong to more demanding listeners, you take more with pleasure specialized Handys - Walkman (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These machines have independent control knobs for MP3, and the operating convenience comes so onto that of an individual MP3-Players here. 
Sony Ericsson, whose Handys have the same user api from the series Walkman as the separately sold MP3-Player, is widest here. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life (usually 15 hours, a maximum up to 35 hours) MP3 player of the above manufacturers achieve to you. 
The first virtual service providers comes already this year to Czech Republic. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic matured right, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as they are offered also by their partners in Western Europe. 
In spite of that something is missing here - a virtual service providers, that forces the classical to lower prices. 
Maybe this anymore long one will be able to be maintained on itself. 
That the Czech car phone providers to the most expensive in Europe work anyway, we already often reported about that on Mobil.cz. 
This confirmed after all also the telecommunications authority TÚ which on that it made attentive that of the price is here higher for a SMS than in the rest of the European Union. 
According to the last steps of the European commission in the field regulation of the Roaminggebühren it comes to a paradoxical situation so probably too - for some customers of the Czech instance SMS will be cheaper from the foreign country than at home. 
how does it come that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, it the competition that in fact does a challenge is missing. 
Maybe it rings paradoxically, nevertheless in the Czech Republic there are three land mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
On the other hand the car phone providers swear about there being a lot of competition on the Czech market extremely with pleasure. 
To the often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority () Pavel Dvoák pflichtet, that had expressed in the past often, that there is not any place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It makes probable that a classic providers with a own network does not have many opportunities more particularly (after all he would also hardly yet probably find frequencies). 
There is, however still a possibility - a virtual service providers. 
Just the entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a clear mark-down with themselves which then the classic instance had to react to. 
In this case there were still similar votes before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile onto the market in United Kingdom as in Czech Republic. 
It, however, it proved that there is place for such providers and that these can be in fact successful. 
After all one does not need to search long for examples. 
To have this in In February we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland. 
Only in just a half year this providers succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and climbing up so to the five - tallest provider of the country. 
The financial group of Penta which has U:fon among other things in Czech Republic supports Mobilking in this case. 
fon has. The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in this case in one being able to concentrate on a much more specific target. 
In order to be able to function effectively virtual service providers need indeed a lot of less customers as a classic suppliers. 
You do not need indeed not a relatively high cost for the building, the company and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world the virtual service providers usually distinguish themselves so as Low-Cost companies out - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, what, however, often of one little is accompanied extensive portfolio of services. 
So Tesco Mobile offers for example SMS more cheaply in Great Britain at least around half than its competitors do. 
How, however the example points from Mobilking in Poland can be also a move, quite good to back on a target audience not klischeehafte. 
these providers consults men in an indeed particular way. 
"Echte fellows choose Mobilking - the provider, which they like and that they trust ability", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual prey. 
Heavy to say whether a similar concept could grip as in terminals also in the Czech Republic get a foothold. 
Also the press officers of Vodafone Miroslav doubts about that epický: "this Czech market is for a market segment which most virtual providers base on, relatively small. 
In addition it is relatively satisfied from the viewpoint of the services. " 
In the Czech Republic chance - free, the car phone providers mean 
It is, however, almost secure that this will not be Mobilking if a virtual instance conquers the Czech Republic. 
"we to talk indeed about an expansion this successful project, nevertheless in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopefully. 
It rather becomes a market entry of Mobilking in other countries our region kommen ", so says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studniková, press officers of the financial group of Penta. 
Indirectly she confirmed so that the current instance are to this idea particularly not inclined in the Czech Republic. 
On the contrary, they attempt to do everything for not a potential competitor arising. 
Your interest at a start of a virtual car phone provider shows already since some time the group to GTS Novera that would like to do a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area company customers. 
"we a great interest in that have, our customers not only Fixed Network -, but to offer also car phone telecommunication services. 
And each formerly, all the better. 
About this opportunity we repeated with all Czech costs negotiates. 
With some of them we "could" achieve "already negotiation progress", according to the press officers of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Maybe now better times come. 
It follows from No official information that maybe the first virtual service providers is to be expected until the end of the year. 
Up to now, however, this of a insurmountable wall of silence is surrounded. 
"in this moment we go out not, that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market shows great specifics opposite other markets. 
Up to now has us still no subject with a complex and serious project in this area address ", means in his declaration for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srse from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
also other providers refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The press officers of t - mobile Martina Kemrová matches in rare with the statement from O2: "up to now we have still not found any viable and both ways useful project which one would keep on being able to build on. 
And she adds: "in the network from t mobile hardly a virtual service providers will emerge until the end of the year. 
In this moment we would have to have been there already a specific offer in order to be able to think so for a short period of time. " 
Vodafone rather focuses its attention on the fulfillment of the demands of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav epický means for this purpose: "for negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the field division of costs and infrastructure. 
Just to consider this we from the viewpoint of the customers as the best. 
The key strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for a rapid mobile Internet. 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The actions of the instance is to be understood easily, a further provider would be called more competition, this would lead to prices to be sunk also to a reduction in the profits and through that. 
Why therefore one should facilitate the entering market for a such competitors? 
also the long one proves Back And Forth that the supplier can pull at pull together if it is a question of something around the origin of U:fon. 
fon. the Probably strongest pressure in direction went at this time, as U: fon onto the market came, from society when. 
also publicly accessible information from the prove that. 
Now, however, itself just has U: fon as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual service providers. 
Martina Kemrová commented on that: "this competitive environment of the mobile telephone market was in addition still strengthened recently by the market entry of a fourth car phone provider. 
Considering the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and especially its services. " 
Faced with this approach the instance the absolute indifference of the Czech regulators amazes, however. 
It is not only a question dabei in order to intervene the attitude of the TÚ that does not have the competence unfortunately in Czech - unlike Great Britain and further highly developed states - into the economic competition. 
This has exclusively the office to the protection of the economical competition (ÚOHS). 
This, however, got its very typical attitude for this whole issue. 
"this market entry of a virtual car phone provider would be then possible, after it resulted in a contract conclusion between a instance and a virtual service providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
Up to now no such treaty was not closed, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional operators ", so in his answer to our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department external relations of the ÚOHS. 
From representatives of the supplier such a formulation would not surprise. 
From an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and to see nobody misuses his position on the market to it among other things this is more than dubious. 
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual service providers in a very normal way work, it is to be observed that their market contributed to a price reduction with mobile telephone services." 
Probably, however, belong the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not for the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Real shocking at this case the almost already moving unison of the three instance that results from their reactions is. 
The question whether it is a question only of a coincidence in fact lies on the hand. 
Just the same as the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations secure only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition is. 
"this authority did not discover in this matter any signs that indicate an action directed towards the competition, and thus she does not have also any reason to intervene in the matter in any way. 
No one of the supplier has a dominant market position, thus he does not have either the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
also the regulator probably lacks the necessary instruments for an aperture of the mobile telephone market to virtual service providers for telecommunication ", Chalupa mentioned in its statement. 
The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many points in dispute. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the TÚ, to which telecommunications is a single market from the viewpoint of the economic competition. 
On such a market no one of the Czech instance holds then of course a dominating position. 
Some legal experts but, offer a different vision - for the market entry of a virtual supplier always the approval of the network operator with is necessary. 
And the instance has this monopoly - logically - for its network. 
That one means that it takes a dominating position in a particular segment of necessity. 
Even if one, however, does not accompany with this argument, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three instance go ahead strikingly similarly. 
In this case complaints of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they find a very similar obstacles in the case of negotiations with all providers. 
The Abwälzung of the blame on the is then a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS distanziert of the whole matter in the telecommunication services. 
This was to be observed already in a number similar cases. 
Unfortunately did not succeed in putting through the enlargement of the powers of the into the novelette of the telecommunications law recently said goodbye onto the field of economic competition in the telecommunication although a number of experts had expected to improve the situation of that. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only far too well, however, probably they have other interests. 
It works already if nobody hinschaut 
The functioning of any of pseudovirtual providers from whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks now remains unseen first once. 
There are companies which issue own schedules of prices for mobile telecommunications services which, however, are only in part public. 
Usually it is a question indeed of companies which act in the field multilevel - marketing. 
their own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and other ones. 
The lists these companies succeeded usually only to chosen ones. 
The joke of the matter consists in the company acting as a classical company customer who makes onto SIM cards an appointment with a large amount opposite the operator. 
As important customer he receives specific quotations (and other offers) then. 
The problem consists in the conditions of all Czech instance forbidding a similar resale. 
there "should" be "cases that you describe, then it can be a question of an injury of the contractual conditions" which "we will occupy ourselves" with "then, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant society", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem. 
Something like that is quite unlikely to itself not to get about with the leaders of the instance, however. 
In particular in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be a question of thousands of customers. 
No operator opposes, however an such approach. 
From the activity of these firms flow them profits indeed not to be neglected, simultaneously they are not influenced - unlike the real virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. 
Onto potential problems Miroslav makes epický attentive: "this law facilitates such kinds of speculation, for all that the services of these companies only of a very small percentage of customers are used. 
These must in addition accept that the SIM-Karte does not work onto your name in their telephone, they can not have therefore that genuinely as the normal customers of the instance. 
Already only that, however, the TÚ would have to occur at least strangely. 
In addition a further question opens up for the ÚOHS. 
The car phone providers shut the eyes to an such approach, why they jib at a virtual providers? 
It is to be added that the ÚOHS for to the discovery of such activities has right strong powers and if it does not want, does not have to zufriedengeben with the declaration of the providers they would not know anything of that and their business conditions would forbid this. 
When Czech Republic is not more expensive 
As in the text already repeatedly was stressed, the market entry of virtual service providers brought a sharp price drop with the different services with themselves. 
Where in all countries virtual service providers virtually arose in this case, attempted the traditional operators, whose to prevent emergence virtually more or less. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market in a too smaller way, and/or too very satisfied, problems with the quality of services and so forth. 
In the highly developed countries but, the regulatory bodies intervened just in these times, that by no means the interests of the instance, but to preserve that of their customers attempted. 
It is through formal measures or nonformal pressure, they achieved, that the first virtual operator arose, and this followed wider. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulatory bodies throw the whole case to themselves as a hot potato. 
Departing from our experience we can not rid ourselves from the impression that problem is more than favorable in the powers in these cases. 
Nevertheless we do not fling the gun into the granule. 
If the background information are right and soon a virtual service providers emerges the Czech mobile market will maybe soon move itself again. 
If a supplier approves the origin of a virtual car phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive if it is a question of refusing other interested parties (to discriminate). 
And the Czechs will not phone then more expensively at last than the rest of Europe will. 
The new Czech National anthem has four new versions. 
Select the best 
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Anthem. 
On Sunday prime minister Mirek Topolánek set the new photos of the national anthem where on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony my country is. 
The anthem was recorded again by the orchestra of the national theater under the leadership from Jií Blohlávek. 
Four versions are available - with masculine or feminine solo song, in chorus version and in an instrumental version. 
Kateina Knínková and Adam Plachetka took over the song composure. 
The persons responsible of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiás and Jaroslav Krek. 
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen now to all four versions. 
For Blohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems. 
Already formerly he had said to the Czech Radio he selected for the solo - variants singers with that young representative vote who are prominent and popular. 
"From the Beginning I attempted at both and then also with the chorus, one clear diction to stop so that one understands the text well so that a line arises", according to the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem celebrates next year her 175 Anniversary. 
Anniversary. The song Kde domov mj rang out for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the state theatre in the initially Czech piece of Fidlovaka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from Frantisek Škroup. 
It became popular, and the people accepted it spontaneously. 
The first stanza of the song became a organic part of the national anthem then after the origin of Czechoslovakia in 1918. 
One of the seven national symbols remained it also after the birth the independent Czech republic.

Next to the libraries one can be able to play the electronic coupons also at self-service automats onto the Opencard, that in some vestibule underground are attached. 
how do these machines look? 
You are red, remind of ticket-cancelling machines, the passengers noticed it maybe already in the underground stations Roztyly, Budjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"currently there are in the city five of them, until the end of the year it is supposed to be, however, eighty", Opatrný adds. 
An automat controls the coupon instead of the driver 
The service of the automats which will function from tomorrow is simple. 
One must import only the chip card, and the before acquired coupon shows off by itself. 
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the environment. 
Therefore in the Vorstadtzügen and on the bus routes with the numbers 300 to 499, with which particularly the inhabitants from communities of the region succeeded central bohemia into the capital. 
"in the trains, that traffic integrated to the Prague appertain, the train companions have reading devices, with which to check it the period of validity of the coupons to time and zone ability", Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid explains the ticket control. This organisation puts together the timetables for the Prague transport services. 
The Vorstadtbusse have reading equipment card at the cash office in the drivers. 
During in boarding The badge does not have to be shown only with the driver, but the Opencard is to be fed at a marked place at the side of the kitty. 
In this way the driver controls the validity of the played coupons. 
a passenger "wants" to check "the validity of the played coupons, nothing is simpler than to ask the driver for this information", so Drápal. 
A passenger that does not go with Vorstadtbussen and does not know when the validity of the coupons ends anymore can go in turn to the automatic, where the coupons to be played onto the card. 
Here the information on the validity its documents are indicated on the display of the appliance. 
The Sudeten required a referendum of the United States 
The Sudetendeutschen ones had requested in 1945 the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes onto the United States. 
This follows from a letter which rests in the collections of the South - Bohemian scientific library. 
If we can not be component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least so under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With a such desire some groups are supposed to have turned in 1945 to the US president from Sudetendeutschen ones. 
This follows among other things from a letter which was maintained in a private archives and which today is kept in the collections of the South - Bohemian scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, it is not supposed to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that was charmed by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - onto Czechoslovakia. 
"we the situation have understood correct and want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies German territory in fact, but when liberator", it is called in a letter, that with the Worten "Menschen, that the fate of the Sudeten hug at the liegt" sign is. 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetendeutschen ones presume - in knowledge of the Czech national character -, the author of the letter ask the American president for their expecting brutality, thoughtlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, to take over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever the protection domination. 
"we can believe not that you award this area to a state other for us without regard for the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants the minorities suppresses and to remove attempted and not contributed in that at all anything for to the victory of the allies has", is to read in the letter. 
The reason for why the author can not sign is supposedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech suppressors". 
If the of the president entertains doubts about the mind of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if it initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau over whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the protection rule of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter likes to ring in today's knowledge of the post-war a little naively, it draws, however a good picture in opinion of some time witnesses with regard to the former expectations of the Sudetendeutschen ones. 
even if at least the bohemian German had to foresee that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only few of them admitted such a possibility to themselves anyway. 
Some waited, that the United States and Great Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Again other believed, they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who comes from Budweis confirms that one. 
It was used as a Budweiser German near the Navy in the Baltic Sea in the war. 
When it came into British captivity at the end of the war and one brought it into a a prisoner of war camp after getting - stone, dozens of further Bohemian Germans came to it, he is supposed to teach them Czech. 
"You believed" if they came back the Czech thing "would" come "to them too" fit ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia reckoned in his view one marketing it from the republic on the basis of the. 
You do not think - then pays! 
An emotion - loaded campaign consults drivers 
Most expensive action for the safety on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so the emotion - loaded media campaign which wants to start the transport ministry on Wednesday could be characterized. 
The authority of minister Ales ebíek promises of talking out drivers of dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns becomes on televison, in the broadcast, in the movie theater, in on the Internet, but also on fly frames run. 
It is supposed to talk out the drivers of too fast operating parameters and alcohol at the steering wheel. 
And reminding her also of fastening the belt for ride starting. 
The campaign wants to talk particularly to especially young drivers motorcyclists, to pedestrians and last but not least to also professional motorists into certain. 
And what is shown in the spots? 
Particularly histories of people who appeal to emotion. 
That shows also this "bloodier" slogan of the whole campaign: 
You do not think - then pays! 
The words "thought not" stehen in capital letters on a sign label. 
and in a pool of blood stands then the word "paid". 
This is supposed to mean that one can pay a moment mistake with the own lives. 
the viewers become the spots to 2010 "impact test". 
The ministry could be inspired from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one in a very normal way can see images with dramatic photographs from accident victims. 
It expects of the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech streets sinking so. 
The spots were put together of the agency euro of RSCG. 
A carrot and stick for the motorist 
"the motto carrot and stick is valid for the driver. 
Carrot means that they save time if for example they go with red. 
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must onto the risks remembered became ", so the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Koán. 
And therefore information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary the psychologist thinks. 
Boards which make the drivers attentive onto a threat are already less effective in his view. 
"Imagine one a static board on, that warns against of an risk, this probably soon with the environment will pass, and they do not become the drivers anymore perceive", Koán means. 
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace 
The chairperson of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all areas that 1967 were filled therefore also the Jordanland, east Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if one can close peace with Palestine and Syria in the replacement for that. 
It accentuated this in an interview which was printed by the daily paper Jediot Achronot on Monday. 
"we must reach for an with the Palestinians, which means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (filled) fields otherwise quite all", Olmert said opposite the newspaper. 
"we keep a certain percentage these areas, nevertheless we will have to hand over a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because not to give no peace it without this becomes", he added. 
He added that a possible return will contain also east Jerusalem. 
"that, that wants safety in Jerusalem and does not want traction engines or bulldozers to roll above his legs particularly will renounce as it happened to one of my best friends, a part of Jerusalem must", noticed Olmert in allusion to two attacks in city in July in the case of which several people were killed and dozens of hurt to people. 
According to words of the prime minister it will be necessary, one "Sonder solution for the Tempelbern and holy and historical places" to find, that lie on the territory of the old town. 
"that, that wants to receive the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city erectly, will have to integrate 270.000 Arabs. 
That does not become functioning ", he kept on confirming. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke out for an outlet of Israeli from the Golan Heights what according to he believes an indispensable condition for the end of a peace agreement with Syria is. 
This would require, however also some effort on part of Damascus. 
"My proposition does not say, with Syria only and to close peace from the Golan heights only on the basis of a withdrawal", confirmed Olmert. 
"this Syrians know only far too good, that they must renounce in order to get back the Golan heights. 
You will have to renounce your current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) movement Hizbollah; they will have to renounce the continuous relief that they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) group Hamas, to the terrorist network Al-Khaida and to the Dschihad (holy war) in Iraq ", the prime minister concretized. 
Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlegal in on the bus? 
She does not know the law, in a long-distance journey bus the Umherlaufen is not allowed 
In Connection with the tragic accident of a bus the society student agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua puts the question, whether stewards and travellers during the journey on the bus hin - and may run. 
"Want we strict and to keep to the law formally, the activity of a steward stands like this contrary to the law over the traffic", so the spokesman for the following Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in the case of which last week a twenty-two year old stewardess died was probably caused by the driver of the lorries who crossed the way to the bus. 
The young woman was in this moment to, on the least safe place in the car, next to the driver although she had have two other seats available. 
A bus can have, however, an accident also in the moment or slow down an accident sharply, in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays, whether the bus is equipped also with standing-rooms according to the vehicle letter. 
If this is not planned in the bus, the travellers must sit. 
The long-distance journey penance of student Agency have no standing-rooms; what the director of the company, Radim Janura, opposite Aktuáln.cz confirmed. 
"this we have discussed with the ministry, and this did not agree first the movement from passengers. 
Later one has this taken back, and we are taken for a consensus according to which the travellers may go onto the toilet during the journey if they have your seat "it informed of his position. 
The law does not know any steward 
"There is not any unambiguous legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role. 
Also no right regulation which forbids it to the carrier gives, however, to produce services. 
The law on the road knows only the concept vehicle companion; it does not define its rights and obligations, however, "the speaker of the department Hanzelka adds unambiguously. 
The director of the Department automobiles of the traffic department Josef Pokorný on the other hand means, that the law subsequently covers this issue. 
"it comes on that whether the bus has also standing-rooms in the product. 
That is then everything ", it stresses. 
Buses subdivide into urban buses where there are standing-rooms and the maximum speed is restricted, local transport buses with standing-rooms and a higher allowed rate and long-distance journey penance without standing-rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats that are equipped with seat belts. 
As in the airplane, the professional says 
The BESIP - specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hoín does not see not a fundamental problem in the movement from stewards on board a bus. 
"With some fluid operating parameters many threats do not threaten, the situation is comparable with the service on board a plane. 
Also here is not secure, when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can push the head. " 
"If a bus brakes, however, sharply, also the laws of physics are valid of course then. 
Just the same as in the city bus or in a tram. 
The Beförderer must "clarify" the safety of the stewards through internal rules, he says and means also that these problems are completely not solved from the viewpoint of the law. 
Janura is ready to delete the services 
Student Agency offers as only bus company services of stewards. 
The company employs around 200 people in this role. 
The director does not regard their profession as risk - pregnant also after the accident. 
"as soon as I, however, the impression that the profession of the steward is risk - pregnant gets I will delete it. 
The travellers can receive coffee and newspapers during in boarding. 
That would become also costs lowering ", he thinks. 
As interest in the security the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin establishes the absence of stewards in his buses. His society practices, however, only one fraction of lines in comparison with a student Agency. 
"We do not have any stewardesses, we defend ourselves against that already from the beginning. 
Sooner or later this with some fatal ends accident ", it had expressed before not completely a year for Týden.cz. 
That was an unbelievable tragedy 
During the accident of a public service bus to Naples a young stewardess from the area Pilsen who had worked two years for the society had verunglückt. 
The Slovenian lorries was probable without flashing from the state that angled and the journey had blocked to the bus. 
The driver of the bus attempted to avoid through a totally manoeuvres, collided, however, with the lorries with the right could. 
Janura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards. 
"These places can not be reserved in the case of long-distance calls, they are blocked." 
firm wants to sue Lorry drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court, she expects a financial compensation, however, also on the part of the guilty party. 
A change? 
Not in view 
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation which a investment team maritime administration already works on over a year. 
"This, however, is not yet taken to any specific conclusion. 
Buses do absolutely not stand either on the agenda, rather the scoring system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones in the event of that one ride ", so specialist Hoín. 
"this traffic department considers the activity of the stewards not than something, that to endanger the safety of the travellers considerably can", so Hanzelka which the control of the security of the buses is near in the competence of the police and the industrial safety authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt 
Great words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive board onto the staff of the house. 
"The central capital market house of the savings bank Finanzgruppe" can arise through a combining of units of the Düsseldorfer bank with the Frankfurter, it is said in the writing become known on Monday. 
The first would bring one "Competence block" with sustainable little in a such business one. 
And anyway a such link can be the decisive impulse to further grouping in the state bank sector. 
So it reads itself if an executive board wants to demonstrate in a difficult time act. 
Because the hit WestLB stands still under tremendous pressure. 
To find a future solution not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Institution for financial service supervision who explained only recently the nordrhein-westfälischen central government the time is urgent. 
Of one as always gearteten combination between the deca-bank, the savings bank customers because of their investment funds know, and the first is, however the speech already for some time - also on Frankfurt side. 
Indeed deca-bank chief Franz Waas made be known with the presentation of the semidates at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the cerium main highway with a state bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see does not make sense. 
Nevertheless the administration council of the Deka which ever half is carried by the state banks and the savings bank associations charged the executive board to lead talks with the first about common business activities. 
In this case it could be a question of the capital market business or parts from that. 
The talks have certainly, so it is called at the financial center, just first begun. 
It is not talked about the deca-bank which numbers among the most important employers with their 3,000 staff at in the city Frankfurt for the first time if it is a question of consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it long looked a moment so, as if Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba can fuse with the state bank the deca-bank. 
Nothing became from this three Federal Government, however. 
Hardly the plans had not become public, the Hessische Central Government spoke out against a participation of the Helaba at that. 
The two other houses did not find then to each other. 
The Rheinland-Pfalz state bank went instead of this onto the Baden-Württemberg state bank in Stuttgart. 
Nevertheless there were again and again thought games about a combination of the deca-bank with state banks. 
Last Günther Merl, executive board chairperson of the Helaba, had spoken out, however, against map exercises about a meeting with his house. 
Independently of that it seems to mature the recognition, however, that a Zusammenrücken of the various houses of the public sector does needed. 
After the regional elections is now in Bavaria past, when first a combination of the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg state bank could come closer. 
For the Helaba that is absolutely not a good information. 
if the pressure to further mergers should increase the partners go out after and after it for that. 
In the south she would be only junior partner, although they has stood the financial crisis up to now by far better as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A meeting with the west LB in turn the savings bank and endorsement association Hessen-Thüringen that is participated in the Helaba with 85 percent at the beginning of the year shot a barrier. 
The north LB would stay if need be. 
Such geostrategic are, however only one side. 
On the other one it is the question of the question as the different business models of the individual houses match. 
In June Merl expressed, the decisive question with the business model the future ability of the state banks is supposed to be guaranteed was not answered by the German savings bank and Endorsement Association up to now. 
At the end the west LB could stand also a dismantling that, however, is not wanted there of course. 
So it is talked then also in the letter of the nonlocal executive board of that, it becomes in any case one "all-in solution" for the house targeted. 
How that with the meeting of individual units with the can be brought under a hat will still be proved. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as "an Italian weekend" 
For Elena it is the first, for Luca the third or fourth time. 
Elena is But this time as his girlfriend with in this case and so everything is different, he says. 
Behind them, near the five litre keg of the brand emperor, a massively built bearded stands and proves to the about 200 october festival travellers how deep tones his throat cut can produce. 
Elena gives Luca only a given smack then kissing on the mouth. 
From Bologna they came to Verona. 
Of here, the bus car park next to the railway station Puorta Nuova, four buses start at this evening at 23.45 o'clock, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," arrival probable 6.00 a.m.. 
Three buses are reserved particularly to mainly the Italians, in a bus travel excluding Brazilians. 
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, celebrated they already in the night have. 
And so aloud, Marco Guarda says that is not anything for Italians. 
The buses belong to Marco which bears a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with broad silver bars – though. 
Since five years ago they go for the October celebration, three swing are it this year. 
At night there, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 p.m. back. 
To stay the night would mean only unnecessary expenses, Marco says. 
The ride, the welcome drink with emperor - beer, brewedly truly the Bavarian purity commandment, costs 75 Euro including the health insurance and the German-speaking travel management - Marco visited a language courses in Frankfurt. 
And already the buses roll into the night, on which Autostrada Richtung "Brennero". 
There is not any beer, not yet. 
It becomes fast calmly in the bus, the travellers sleep. 
good thing so, they will still need their forces. 
People aim in Brixen and in wood churches, where many other buses insert a break once again with Italian markings at the motorway 8 shortly before Munich. 
As Marcos group finally systematic around half seven o'clock in the early in the car park near the Theresienwiese arrives, outcrop there already the 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other ones collect themselves, Marco holds a last address, declaredly the attack plan. 
Firstly: Putting on the yellow Käppchen. 
On that "October celebration" stands to the left, in fracture, next to that the web address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: "if the doors to the beer whose open, it means to walk!", Marco calls in the morning. 
"operation!" operation and the places in the rear part of the tent fill. 
"not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps onto the same benches, in the room distribute! 
Marco roars The measure, costs 8,25 euros. 
And tip not forgotten. 
"this security people to show that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave the seats in, they are away "! 
Thirdly: "This evening point half eleven again here arrive"! 
"Understood? 
And already gone 'it to the Wiesn. On the way one ties Yellow sever to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party as way brands. 
One wants to be armed for the withdrawal. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, as known "to Italian weekend". 
There are not Accurate data on figures; it is talked about 50 000, that onto the way across the Alps do and to invade the beer tents, 10% of all visitors are supposed to be arrived at this weekend separately from Italy. 
The Munich police are reinforced through seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red cross which leads a international statistics in which the Italians coat the first place with about 200 medical supplies before Britons (about 60 operations) and (about 80). 
The court brew whose is especially liked with Italians. 
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed first in that one lasted week. 
How good, that the politicians the word "relative" use and also still inserted, that the German banking sector of the troubled developments is not spared to. 
Because that one kicked in at the weekend now. 
The inhabitant of Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted down in the Dax receives a billions of credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield oneself from the turbulence at the markets. 
A with the situation familiar person, said Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate must pay only on the part which it also uses interest. 
The money comes both of private and public banks. 
Losses are background with the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself extremely for a short period of time according to a newspaper report for long period of time projects for which it lent money - what meanwhile because of the suspicion at the markets more is not possible. 
In the first half of 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk to 95 per cent on 2,37 million euro, also the equity had given easily from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. 
The running profits and net revenue deriving from financial transactions had fallen opposite the period last year onto zero, the proceeds sunk from ascription to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolution from accrued liabilities in the credit business around more than 70 per cent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher profits from payments of subordinate settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the payment of interests according to the tax and from the business errand for Associated Companies, the profit minus with about 16 percent had made drop out still moderat. 
The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial borrowing capabilities verspekuliert, that then in the Aareal Bank ausgegliedert were. 
Because one earned too little in the classical state financing, the Depfa had intensified then in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint efforts of private investors and the state engages (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
Onto the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out now writing-off that will have an "essential physical effect" on the typical of the group be called it quite indefinitely. 
The fact is that the dividend was deleted. 
Already for 2007 it had been abbreviated around two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is since the Depfa incorporation an important State - and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
It is stronger than other institutes of the refinance at the interbank market dependent, since she does not have any customer deposits. 
With the breakdown of the American investment bank of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending versiegt among banks again to a large extent since the banks hoard their solvency. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually short-term funds to refinancing for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Kreditportfolios of the Depfa. 
After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group is covered with the credit onto the foreseeable future and that enterprise "of the influence of the currently to a large extent inoperative international ones money market" screen. 
From other sources it is to be heard that thanks to the money the refinance is safeguarded until end of 2009. 
The HRE executive board chairperson Georg Funke declared, on the other hand that the Hypo Real Estate Group more will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
Bundesbank and the Federal Institution for financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Gruppe is now safeguarded. 
That is entitled to for shareholders and creditors of the bank hope. 
But faced with the dynamism and Unwägbarkeiten of the crisis there is not is no certainty. 
It is not even unconceivable that the funding does not have to be used in full extent. 
But also the opposite is not to be split off. 
After at on Late Sunday evening according to the hearing the bank still stood before the bankruptcy also at least temporary rescue is able not to calm the feelings. 
The share price starts by 75% on 3,30 euro. 
On the other hand quite well the lending transactions hold themselves. 
The priority debts do not last in a hardly in motion way show, the courses of the Nachrang-Anleihen drop more clearly. 
Particularly the loans of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and understandably the more than 2009 exceeding terms are affected. 
If hypo-real - Estate - loans seem a speculative annex alternative formerly whose stipulating must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system so after the clear sharpening of the banking crisis and the institute itself which with the incorporation of the Depfa the crisis had gotten to itself first into the house. 
For so long the central banks, governments and less hit commercial bank for to support the system still ready are, for so long a proud eradication of pensions can be gone out of. 
Or however it what somebody currently hardly yet dares to hope comes - that the financial crisis is overcome in the next 15 months. 
However faced with the announcements somersaulting with the partial nationalisation only an entitled hope currently became from the probability verging on security. 
That might prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they are supposed to separate from their commitment particularly for long-term believers. 
Short-term investors can use a draw line after all for that a loss presentation for the future settlement tax payments onto course profits of later years form. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento - box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first school day at the Tachibana Highschool the girl start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange bonfire it tells about Japan. 
"this first school day in Japan. 
I was annoyed. 
Already before the way to school I had fear. 
I live on the fringe of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, for the luck I did not get lost. 
The teaching beginning does not seem as severe definedly at the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils arrive from 8 p.m., to twenty in front of nine a short meeting round with the teachers begins, this' home room '. 
However before the education began, I was at the series, to introduce me. 
In this case I am not at all for this purpose the model which speaks with pleasure before people who before a class of 40 pupils yet. 
Because I did not have yet any school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my visitor mother, for this purpose blouse, blue knee-length socks and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I positioned myself therefore before the bench and attempted to express everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana.' - I am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday. 
In the moment I was very glad, that I had begun already before good two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class whispered all, giggled and gewunken and continuously I have the word "Kawaii" belong. 
I knew that already from my Mangas. 
It appertains to the survival - important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' sweet, sweeten '. 
Then I darted quickly onto my place. 
The girl next to me grinned quite broad, she found an honour it, that the exchanges between pupils should be next to it. 
The rest of the moment was quite calm, however, when the gong sounded, I was assailed downright. 
All talked durcheinander and giggled and asked me punctures into the gut - in this case it is really heavy to understand Japanese English. 
In the break all their Bentos unpacked then. 
My official mother had made me also such a lunch box - that is once something different than the dull German tracing breads. 
I had rice with herbs and spices, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
Mostly I do not have not got clue, which I eat here in Japan exactly. 
The things look strange and taste completely novel. 
Firmly it is that everything is really delicious. 
'Oh well, up to the saltily pickled plums maybe, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not lunch at Japanese schools only one - times. 
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a young a self prepared Bento that prepares it especially artistic then - in the hope to become acquainted with the boy near the Pausensnack nearer. 
From that I read in my Manga - cartoons. 
I am once tense, whether I can also observe that here. 
'why then it is Japan?', my friends asked to me when I told to them that I want to go into Tokyo to school for a year. 
I always said then: 
"Because it fascinates me now." 
Finally I already for years most with pleasure read Mangas. 
And so that I understand the cartoons and the culture in that better to learn a bit Japanese, I began also sometime. 
For me it was therefore completely clear that I had to travel sometime here. 
Because I also have weak spot for tradition, customs and practices. 
And onto those ones one puts is great value. 
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I felt not lost here also yet even if Tokyo is the biggest city which I ever saw. " 
Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees in the case of danger is said that, that she feels also fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: To have also a lot animals feelings. 
Only how could one check whether they feel the same thing if they behave similarly as we? 
in the internet journal "Edge" became published since several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
MIRROR ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to those ones question "what you hold for true, to be able to prove without it? 
I believe that animals have feelings and other awareness states without otherwise I or somebody being able to prove this up to now where we can not even prove that other people have awareness. 
However, in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to other species, however, and touch questions of the opinion or generally more of consciousness, we enter unwegsames ground because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat in danger takes, she does the same thing as many other animals: She surrenders in a dead way, flees or attacks. 
People behave similarly, to close from which some scientists onto a comparable subjective experience. 
I do not believe in that, however. 
Two aspects of the brain structural make it difficult to apply our subjective experience to that from animals. 
On the one hand the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and at the Ausfuehrungs - / control functions). 
This broad region is much more highly developed with the human being than with the remaining primates and seems with other creatures to be missing entirely. 
To plan at least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex under that the knowledge, who we are, and the ability and to decide, reason to believe exists therefore, that the human being distinguishes even from the other primates. 
A further dramatic character might lie in the linguistic nature of the people: Since a so big part of his experience is combined with language, it is said often the awareness depends on that. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
However, even if conscience did not depend on language, this would influence it certainly so that animal consciousness as it likes to be also to get it would be distinguished from most of our Bewusstseins-zustaende probably very much. 
Therefore it is heavy to investigate how awareness likes to look at other animals. 
When it, as something Intern and Subjective, neither do not measure yet, because of the specific hardware, analyze by means of our own experience makes, so his research into puts us before major problems. 
Most of my comments refer to the contents of the conscious experience, nevertheless there is next to that another further aspect of the consciousness which might be scientifically more simply accessible. 
One could examine the processes of awareness of animals without regard for their content, and happen exactly that with studies about the short-term memory of primacy, in particular at the example of the visualization. 
However with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlatives of consciousness than onto the causal mechanism: Both like to be identical or neither. 
Interestingly enough this approach accentuates also the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the materialization of the visualization. 
what turns out now for the feelings? 
I would drive it back on an emotional system as that of the fear being activated in a brain, conscious of his own activity. 
What we as "fear" describe, the mental state in which we are if main memory proves the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) is therefore. 
Feelings are so seen tied to the areas of the Cortex that distinguish primates and in particular the people closely. 
fine varying degrees of the surrenders to Combined with the linguistic nature because we can differentiate situations with the aid of the words and the grammar and categorize states in order to ascribe it also to other ones next to us ourselves. 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio thinks for example that feelings follow from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, who concentrates on the brain stem more, however. 
Since this network did not change in the course of human evolution very much, it can be participated in kind - comprehensive feelings absolutely. 
In that in theory I can not contradict that, it holds, however, for unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear probably feels so also in two cases: how, however, can one check whether rats and people feel the same thing if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees in the case of danger whether also she feels fear? 
In my eyes bare similar behaviour can not prove yet any experience equality. 
Indeed the neurale arrangement keeps on helping: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, cockroaches on the other hand not even a brain. 
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings? 
And even if one could prove that for the people: How did one want to prove it at rats? 
I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), feelings have. 
But I would not know how I should prove that. 
And because their feelings are presumably distinguished from ours basically (since the human consciousness is based on specific circuits and on language), I investigate more with pleasure the emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of rats. 
Anyway progress beckons here on the neuralen tier provided that one measures the same thing with rats and people. 
How I do not investigate language and awareness at rats, so neither feelings, I know nevertheless not, whether they exist. 
One likes to hold that for shortsighted, but I come more with pleasure ahead than to walk continuously against a wall. 
I am now more practical emotional ist. 
Üfa - president Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine 
The deputy prime minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would be put soon under the direct responsibility by president and prime minister. 
"this government sees the decision of the Üfa in Bordeaux as a confidence evidence into the Ukraine and its ability, that euro together with Poland to organize", Wasjunik said. 
"That is not, however not a amnesty for our country. 
The work just began first and doing still a lot gives in both countries. " 
In the time pattern for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports the two hosts limp afterwards. 
Possibly even the number of the EM - stadiums is reduced to six by eight. 
"We can not waste no time. 
We must "work" now with top speed ", the Ukrainian association - president Grigorij Surkis said. 
"this UEFA will keep to us unchangeably in mind. 
An even more radical step was decided on in Poland. 
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended according to numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission had come together on request from sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It good married state "this serious danger that the PZPN is not capable according to the rules to action", Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said. 
"we Üfa president Michel Platini in a letter have insured, that the preparations for Euro 2012 will not suffer from that. 
Several first had been condemned to the compulsory decline alone in the last season because of manipulation, finally even the league start had to be postponed for a short period of time. 
Indignant Dennis Quaid hits back 
She wanted a new film promoten, talked in the interview about private - and with the ex has now: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete their Passed Dennis Quaid as adulterers. 
That one foams - and hits back. 
Late rose war near the ex married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce the two hollywood players deliver now an unpleasant quarrel with each other - in all public. 
Meg Ryan had expressed itself in an interview with the US journal InStyle last week for the first time to the reasons for the failing of the marriage: "Dennis was to me for a long time unfaithful, and that was very painful. 
The extent of fraud brought it only after the divorce into experience. 
Reason for the soul performing a striptease was Ryans press work for their new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told. 
Dennis Quaids reaction to his Outing as an untrue husband turned out clearly: it is "Ungeheuerlich", the 54 - year long one of the "New York Daily News" said, that "Meg for the repeated time ruminates the history of our relationship and seals". 
It is furthermore "regrettable", that the common 16 - year old son Jack "is remembered renewed" public onto the pain and the Revolution, which a divorce for each child mean. " 
During Ryan since the divorce alone lives, Quaid is again married and father of twins became recently. 
And so close to his Einlassungen with the dig: "my life goes on anyway. 
I consider myself happy that I have a wonderful family which at best it go for. " 
Prices for airline tickets and hotels sink 
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stay were cheaper in Europe than in the previous year. 
In Germany flights became according to a recent study even up to 50 percent cheaper. 
Flights and in hotels became again more favorable - that is the result of a study of the travel and finance service provider American Express. 
The company analyzed his posting dates from the first half of 2008 and found a sharp slump after a rise of in prices in the first quarter of in the second quarter. 
After the prices increased to the hotel trade for years, the overnight stay already verbilligt themselves in many places. 
Of January to March the prices still changed from 48 examined European cities in 41 average 6.9 per cent compared to 2007. 
Of April to June the prices but were already, however, about 3,6 percent lower than in the previous year. 
the trend was clearest in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year before. 
American Express sees the weak dollar has fallen as a cause for that, that too one "abnehmenden like travel has more American tourist" gefuehrt. 
Also financial markets are affected as Frankfurt or London more strongly from the drop of the hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city the hotel prices with a rise of 26,3 percent hold even the record in Europe. 
Also with the air the trend still pointed in the first quarter up: 
Because of the kerosene increase in price travellers had to pay 7.1 per cent more in economy class average an than 2007, fuel - intense long-distance flights even became up to 29,2 percent more expensive. 
Of April to June the prices sank for airline tickets the economy class around average 12.5 per cent in the arrangement to the preceding quarter, in which Business - and the price changes, however, were by far smaller to First-Class, however. 
Into Germany the prices started still more strongly than in other European countries: 
Of January to March the prices had increased around 11,9 percent, in the second quarter they sank around 23,6 percent. 
On German domestic flights the price even halved themselves according to of the study. 
On the one hand Reason for the fall in prices is the decreasing economic growth the company declares. 
The demand in many rungs of the trip market crumbles. 
On the other hand there is an increased competition pressure through the Open-Skies-Abkommen which liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of the strained situation is the cancellation of unprofitabler routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of the airlines that would have announced bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe these were 24 airlines. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a door and simple methods the Hamburger SV becomes table leader. 
At that one Borussia it succeeds Luhukay furthermore not, to find a functioning Eleven. 
From Kristoffer Klein increase crash landing for national players Marko Marin. 
The Gladbacher came first late ins Spiel and failed with a lifter onto the set bar. 
His embassy was exactly formulated, it went convincingly to him over the lips. 
He knew schlichtweg that he was right. 
"we the second need Tor", Hermann Rieger hissed into the cabin gear of the hamburger arena. 
Much was not rid in the catacombs, the half-time tracing was ended and most were again on their seats. 
Rieger was almost three decades Physiotherapeut of the HSV, he enjoys a higher renown than manch passed actor. 
And his request found also be heard like this at responsible place. 
Assistenztrainer Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted the cross our fingers in agreement. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg manager Martin Jol. 
its orders will have said similar: 
Here with fool two! 
The conversion was missing. "There everything was not to be looked at today beautifully", Marcell Jansen admitted later. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more loosely. 
That 1:0 have to owe (1:0) the hamburger to the header hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the circumstance, that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak hamburger whose. 
"it a dirty was Sieg", Martin Jol summarized. 
The Hamburger SV becomes on this Monday 121 years old. 
The spectators celebrated in the Saturday afternoon itself, the blue sky over the arena and the flash table on the videowall which expelled their club as Klassenprimus already once. 
It will become a birthday without any real party. 
"We know to classify that", Marcell Jansen said. 
He foresees that the tabular Zwischenzeugnis stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the Dominanz of his HSV. 
The team with your late pledged entrances - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as the Jansen abgeworbenen from were Bavaria - finds itself slow indeed, it is not, however, able to shine yet. 
"We need more Flair and more dribbles", Jol required.

Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon guarantees near research for doom: The rate of space probes influences dark tissue during so called swing - by - maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general General Theory of Relativity Albert Einsteins could not be very correct. 
Almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the space. 
Because of soon freezing fuel management the cold death threatens it now. 
Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon guarantees for years for confusion - the swing by anomaly. 
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in the case of which they receive additional momentum in the gravity field of a celestial body such as the Earth. 
Through that the probes can save much fuel. 
The European - American research study Cassini-Huygens used these physical trick just the same as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What amazes the researchers already for years, however, in this case: the as do not behave 100-prozentig so as one would expect it according to the old - venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather it results in irregularities to the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Up to now the physicists could not explain this effect. 
You christened it swing - by - anomaly. 
Some experts fear that even the general theory of relativity could not be very correct possibly to Albert Einsteins, who describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of the area. 
The American physicist Stephen Eagles of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes still firmly in Einstein not wandering, and attempts to explain the swing - by - anomaly with the aid of the so-called dark matter that astronomers defined in the universe. 
"Dark matter" that "could also completely be near of the Earth could be" responsible for the anomaly ", he writes. 
The space researchers do not know about the existence of dark matter before since around some ten years ago. 
An attraction that effect on other celestial bodies can be observed goes out of it obviously. 
She herself is on the other hand completely invisible, that is, it does not send and does not reflect no electromagnetic radiation, in particular is also no visible light. 
After the calculations of scientists the dark matter defines after all well a Fünftel of the entire mass of the universe. 
Tourists kidnapped into Egypt are free 
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers the tourists verschleppten into Egypt are supposed to be again free as the Italian foreign minister confirmed. 
The kidnappers from Sudan had required several millions of euros of ransom. 
With a shooting before the release six captors are supposed to have been killed. 
In the south five German were kidnapped. 
Ransom - negotiations are already supposed to run. 
Again and again German get into targeting of kidnappers. 
World online describes the most important cases. 
The European tourists verschleppten in the Sahara are apparently free. 
the Egyptian state television service -, the Arabian TV - sender Al-Arabija and Italian media told this matchingly. 
The Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of the Italian television broadcast station Sky TG 24: "our fellow citizens and the other hostages were freed. 
We just check theirs Gesundheitszustand ", Frattini said. 
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and out of danger, the Egyptian state television told. 
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are supposed to be already on the way to Cairo. 
Unclearly the background of a shooting keep on remaining before the release of hostages: Accordingly the kidnappers were ready for to end the kidnapping according to according an Egyptian security officers before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers surprisingly. 
"this problem was solved. 
You were with a ransom agreed ", the officials said. 
It were "only still for that gone, the hostages to receive took", when sudden "this surprise" kam. 
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers to death on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them. 
The captors had required a ransom of Germany at the level of six million euros; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The daily paper "El Masri El Jom" report under citing a German mediator, the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety. 
According to the report the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom. 
The men should be held for so long firmly, until the kidnappers would have a safe escape route. 
The German embassy in Cairo refused an opinion on the report. 
Misuse of the stepfather "led to the suicide" 
The abuse lasting for years through their stepfather resulted in a woman killing herself was told a court. 
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a sentence of six years, after it had stood eight cases of sexual abuse. 
The court in exists Truro found out, that it enthralled his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle regularly als sie between five and seven years when was. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feels me responsibly for her death. 
The court found out that Ms Randle killed herself in their house in Mutley, Plymouth, on the 1st April 2007 in the age of 34. 
When it lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had enthralled her and joined their eyes before he carried out sexual acts, while their mother was being away in order to work in a pub. 
Trerise and his wife made themselves be separated in the 1980ern and he moved back to Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth. 
The court found out, however, that Ms Randle, that a large part their time in an honorary capacity for the National trust worked, of by the abuse was pursued, that had been added to her twice in the week. 
Public prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends would have said that Ms Randle, the one eager Surferin and cyclist had been, since in 2006 "emotionally dead" was and would have given "up" their life 
In April 2007 their correct father Terrance Randle found it dead in their flat in Plymouth. 
It is accepted, that she killed itself when itself by means of a plastic bags has smothered. 
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter which ended so: "I maintained to enthrall her and to bandage their eyes. 
"I it has sexually not forced. 
I feel responsible for her death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen said Trerise too: "her are one extreme strange fetishist and for their victims it must have been frightening in particular since it was first to seven. 
This unfortunate story ends with the suicide of the victim. 
The fact that the matter is very unlikely to be before court ended if she had not done this is worse even. " 
He added: "I for the knowledge what impact takes, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, their action about the years to your daughter had. 
She would have been otherwise a promising, successful and happy young woman unambiguously. " 
Officials, responsible for lost data, is accused 
The BBC found out, that the cabinet official that had lost strictly confidential documents in June in a train will become according to this "Public safety law" accuse. 
by the was delegated by the ministry when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train after Waterloo. 
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were given to the police. 
It is the weakest charges within the law and there is not no indication of criminal intent. 
BBC Verteidigungskorrespondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall. 
He said: "You would have thought, that so that in an intern way with in the Ministry of Defence and cabinet would be explained." 
The employee that name can not be called is accused according to paragraph observation 8.1 of the law, the stipulation that deals with the safe storage of information. 
The Royal prosecutor recommended that the officials is supposed to be accused of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Gemeinsamen Geheimdienstkommitee through the Metropolitan Police. 
The documents which he misplaced contained classified evaluations about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces. 
He was informed of the decision at on on monday morning and was brought from his house onto a secret kept the ground. 
House building societies see B & B costs into the eye 
The Bradford and Bingley Bank cost of more than 80 million pounds into the house could suit to British housing owned companies after the rescue. 
The government provided 14 billion pounds in order to protect the insertions of Bradford & Bingleys 2,6 million customers. 
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all enterprises which get money from investors including the 59 property companies 
The president of the union of the housing societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said, it were "intolerable", that the societies and their members would have to pay. 
That 14 billion loans will be paid back to finally if loans are wiped out to Bradford & Bingleys. 
But the in the meantime accumulated interests are charged each year that one 700 finance enterprise, to accept the payments. 
The program to for the compensation of financial services confirmed opposite the BBC that the 59 housing societies are contained in this figure. 
It is bitter, that those institutions, which behaved prudently. to be called now in order to take over some of the cost of those institutions that less were prudent by far. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It said it that every company would have to pay in relation to the insertions which it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay 18% of the costs together about. 
The Treasury reckons that the interest will amount to 450 million pounds for the loan in the year 2009. 
That is, that the societies must get 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, the president of the union of the house building societies, informed the BBC that he believes that this is unfair. 
It is bitter, that those institutions, which behaved prudently during the property recovery now to be appealed to for taking some of the cost from the institutions that less were prudent by far. 
According to the BSA not a society has failed since the existing of the records in the year 1945. 
"We will observe all aspects of this thing over the next few weeks in order to see what alternatives there are in order to protect housing societies and their members from potentially major costs." 
The interests that become due in 2009 cover the seven months of end of September to these year's until end of March. 
In the year 2010 interest become due for a full year and that could be almost twice so much. 
Since property companies are organizations on both sides without companions, become its members for the cost either through higher fees or must pay lower interest rates on savings accounts. 
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive 
The people on Jersey see themselves confronted with having to pay more for their milk. 
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the central market price of his milk around further five pence per litre from Monday. 
It the second price increase is this year, after one two pence of increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting company were carried out. 
The retailers are supposed to decide themselves whether they would like to pass on the increase in prices to their customers. 
Before the price increase in February the central market price of Jersey milk was last in 2002 changed. 
Bail is refused A former prime minister of Bangladesh 
A court in Bangladesh rejected a cautionary request of the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if it returns into the country. 
Their defenders said, that the court refused bail concerning of charges 50 million Taka ($729,700) to have extorted from a businessman while she was being prime minister. 
The case is one of several floating accusations because of corruption against them. 
Sheik Hasinas long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month on bail. 
Sheikh Hasina is supposed to return in the next few weeks to Bangladesh, but their party the Awami alliance, required that the military - supported transitional government should give her first full freedom. 
To say the correspondents that it is not although prison suspension was given to her in order to go abroad for medical treatment within the framework of their release clear whether it will be able to remain wider on free foot if it returns to Bangladesh. 
Her lawyers serve, that they now onto that one Uppermost court of justice against the decision of the top court will appeal. 
"this upper court sheik Hasinas cautionary request has rejected, because it says, that it does not give no bail must get, since it is already on prison suspension abroad, around abroad treated became", their attorney Rafique-ul Huq said. 
We will announce a legal action against the top court. " 
Her lawyers object, that she needs bail around from abroad in the country to return in order to prepare oneself for the elections in December. 
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after the 17th October, an Awami-Bündnis-Parteivorsitzender said on Sunday. 
She was arrested last year after the army - supplementary transitional government had taken over the power, had been released, however, from prison from in June in order to go abroad for medical treatments. 
both sheik Hasina, as also Khaleda Zia, all charges deny against themselves. 
Apprehensions around the in Afghanistan 
In the recent in Afghanistan nearly 200 000 children were not vaccinated due to the power which is brought with the Taliban in touch, such as the United Nations. 
The United Nations carried out last week a vaccinating - program in six provinces. 
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons. 
According to a spokesman for the UN this was the case in spite of the promise of the Taliban, that thousands of not to attack employee carrying out the vaccination and/or to hinder employee carrying out the inoculations. 
BskyB loses complaint in the case ITV 
BskyB reduced his complaint against the decision of the competition commission its share at the competing sender ITV, lost. 
The competition court of appeal verordnet BskyB, his participation in ITV of 17.9% on less than 7.5 to reduce%. 
Before the commission had said the part BskyBs distorts the competition and makes an unlouder influence on the sender ITV for him possible. 
BskyB gained his part in 2006, when it NTL, renamed now in Virgin media, successful at the purchase of ITV has hindered. 
In April 2007 the competition authority told the purchase of the part at ITV through BskyB prepares doubts about the independence of the ITV, which persuaded the competition commission to starting an investigation. 
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom spoke out against the purchase. 
BskyB argued, to reduce the pressure his part at ITV, is an unreasonable and exaggerated measure in particular because BskyB had announced to want to give up his voting rights. 
New study in the US American public prosecutor affair 
The U.S. attorney general charged a special observer to deal with the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006. 
The cause was a report of the general auditor of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized. 
The report practiced critical at the officials of the White House, legislators and the former attorney general Alberto Gonzalez. 
The investigation was driven from the fears, the lawyers were dropped off for political reasons. 
The Spezialermittlerin Nora Dannehy is supposed to clear now whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lay to the investigator in order to hinder the justice system. 
Serious reproaches including criminal actions were completely not examined or clarified, the general auditor Glenn Fine said in his report. 
The appointment of a special observer with the authorization to force the witnesses to the statement was one of his main recommendations. 
The conflict began as the Justice Department in the December 2006 nine US public prosecutors of their offices relieved. 
To this time the department argued, the public prosecutors would be released due to weak works. 
However, it was arrested later, that the released public prosecutors not worse than a lot of their Kollegenbe judges were, many observers were led to considering the redundancies were as political in a motivated way become. 
Some of these public prosecutors were included in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen while other ones had been refusing to examine the allegations about electoral fraud of the Democrats. 
US American public prosecutors are charged to examine for the government and to pursue judicial cases. 
You can release at any time, must not be dropped off, however, for political reasons. 
The former head of the Justice Ministry Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez got because of the redundancies under attack and has his in at the end office lays down. 
A series of officials of the Ministry of Justice also quit. 
The report of the general auditor spoke in particular to in particular the role crucially from Gonzalez when it would bear the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, "would have given up" its leading and would have shown himself "unusually in the process" desinteressiert " 
Other officials, under that also the former major advisers of the president Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.

"Coldplay" mention the nominations for the prize this year at, after it came into four categories into the shortlist. 
The chief talking - actuator the journal "Q warehouses" Paul Rees said, there would be some songs, which exceed such matters as time and pointed and "Bat Out Of Hell" were certainly one of them. 
The song, that by Jim Steinman was written, a strong voice that was supplied by Meat Loaf required. 
It begins with an instrumental part, which nearly two minutes lasts. 
The song appeared in Great Britain as single in 1979 in the sale and reached place 15 in the charts. 
Yet has Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" approximately spent nine years in the charts and once sold to worldwide more than 40 million. 
Meat Loaf, whose true name Marvin Lee Aday is, suffered in recent years from serious health problems. One under that was an operation in the year 2003 because of irregular heartbeat, after it had collapsed on the scene. 
In 2007 he had to call off concerts due to an acute larynx inflammation. 
Later it became known that he had a cyst at his vocal cord. 
Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possible soon to sell 
From what New York City united thousands of highways, avenues, side streets and other by-pass roads famously, and from what other are only comfortable. 
Nevertheless it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing Local heavy to say where there is Extra Place, simple, because most have never heard about that. 
These tiny Street is in the East Village and runs from the first to Street Richtung north between Bowery and to Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
It is 30 feet broad and 120 feet long and rather looks like a dusty alleyway than to a passage route in an acting way used. 
There are not also no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard street plan. 
Nevertheless this street has its admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently constructed luxurious buildings on the first Street. 
copy place wants to pave again in order to take a clean passage to the shops and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings. 
the longstanding neighbourhood belongs to the other admirers, that one simply says it is fascinated from the short alleyway because she is one of the remains of the past of the block. 
Nevertheless the local administrative department which is responsible for protection and establishment of the accommodation and is responsible for the street does not have any interest in receiving it. 
During a session of the committee for land use of the parish council this month representatives projected of the City Council and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction. 
Nevertheless the committee prefers, that the road stays in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan that is supposed to be presented in next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the local authorities in the town council 3. 
very little room stayed in owned by the city and we would like, that Extra Place "keeps on" belonging "to the city, she said. 
"It Angebote could give what could be finished by Avalon as one repairs the street and practices the street, however, we also want the public access to keep on being guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay, who the company would like to let out space to, announced some months ago that pave small streets again and seats that are among other things thought for a café arrange. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was turned into the first time in public during the meeting in this month. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road indeed, it does absolutely not want to have her, however. 
"The preoccupation of the Avalon Bay is it this decayed lane renovate and to turn into a public meeting point", she said and added that the city itself had suggested the sale. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department of crop protection thought it was the desire of the city actual to sell the streets and accentuated, rather to develop it the property than to manage the task of the department is. 
Compared with his colored neighborhood The Bowery extra place retained something of its historical impression. 
Some believe that the road agreed with their names in the year 1802, as a big farm which belonged to Philip Minthorne between his numerous children people split up and a close strip land was not demanded by any. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk skirt monument that was closed in 2006 opened itself to the Extra Place and the street is certain most the most confessed by Ramones as a scenery for the photograph on the Cover of the album "Rocket to Russia". 
The location was splendid, Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones which had made the photograph was in November 1976, said. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rogue and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and rope. 
Unite inhabitants, including the Blogger that write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, refused the idea of the sale from Extra Place, with the argument, that this public plot, as modest as it is, keeps on being supposed to stay public. 
Other considered Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be let in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, which the Blog by the name of "Jeremiahs" practices "disappearing New York" (untertitelt with "The book of complaints: A bitter nostalgic look onto the city becoming extinct"), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place that had appeared in the journal "The New Yorker" in the years in 1952. 
The author Brendan Gill, wrote then: "extra Place is a small narrow dead-end street, which remains even during the day dark and characterized by rusty metal door of warehouses, shut windows and week - old newspapers flying onto rainwater gutters past is". 
With few exceptions the road looked just as recently at an evening. 
A rat walked through the rear part of the street, not far from the door that formerly led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today. 
Graffiti was to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle did not lie on the ground far from a fresh bundle of newspapers thrown out. 
Nevertheless Some passers-by said they would have thought about special place rare suggested, that the road could be polished up a little. 
Fields, added, that in his opinion, to underestimate some people the charm of the street in their current state. 
He said, the best years of my life, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting. 
Debate about bilingual education: education in English-speaking world, surroundings 
In this edition of the "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual training. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in specific area of expertise education sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a co-author is of the book "not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class a school selection need". 
To speak to the hispanischen voters is a complicated task. 
Bar rack Obama propositions on the issue education are a typical example of that. 
Obama campaign mentions, that "to finish the probability with afro - American and hispanischen pupils successfully the school, lower is, than with white pupils - what tunes". 
In order to close this service distance, Obama education action plan recommends a bilingual in particular among other ones in the training for those ones who learn English first. 
Nevertheless the question exists at Obama darin whether his use contradicting his interest for the bilingual training that puts which focuses on onto instruction in other languages than English reducing the distance in the sportsmen. 
let's take "Sixth Street Prep" a primary school, as an example in eastern Los Angeles. 
Is The majority of pupils hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than one third parties of the pupils from whom many are not before recently in the country learn English. 
Nevertheless 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class passed the public examination into 2008 amazing ones in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprisingly 93 per cent of children were valued as good from the fourth school year in the English examination. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those ones that are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its focus, onto permanent control of the knowledge and an attitude which does not tolerate no exceptions, on inspection and practice. 
Furthermore the school practises the approach to which the training proceeds in a English-speaking surroundings. Exactly that the point which Obama is supposed to pay attention to, according to the headmistress Linda Mikels is. 
This approach puts importance onto the almost exclusive use of the English language in the compartment instruction. 
Woman of Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual training, said to me the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the schoolroom before and would not recognize could it anymore. 
"It functions", she said, "it functions for us". 
Obama would become a school how this "Sixth Street Prep" as model for other schools with great proportion at Latin American and other English learning pupils take? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easy, however, the formation - political positions within his of own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen already long support the idea of bilingual training) and his own unstinting support for the bilingual training do answer to predictions uncertainly above Obama. 
While he is agreeing to the point, that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert the issue recently in his saying that people should stop to make oneself for worries about the legislation aiming at "only English". 
Instead of this, he said: "her are supposed to guarantee, that their child Spanish can". 
If Obama wants to close the service distance in fact, he is supposed to consider carefully education systems that function instead of despising it and trivialisieren. 
The the price of oil sinks due to renewed fears around the economy 
The price of oil is on Monday because of fears, that even the American plan rescue could not suffice for the financial markets the economy again to liven up, strongly fallen. 
The crude oil forward transactions at the New Yorker commercial markets are fallen in the morning session around 7 per cent on $99.80 per barrel. 
since last Monday the price around more than $20 sank. 
In the last two weeks ago the goods markets are both from the financial turbulence Wall Street and than also of strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico shaken. 
After the prices had reached their climax of $145.29 in July per barrel, they are awake in this month $90 per barrel fallen almost, around then again, to climb, as a result of the enormous uncertainty into that one financial markets. 
On Monday investors showed themselves already again worriedly although congress representatives had announced they would have agreed at the weekend over on a rescue plan which the largest should be in the history. 
This news was overshadowed of new concerns, that the financial crisis is not by far yet finished. 
In the moment last chapter of the growing crisis, should, according to a government communication on Monday that Citigroup buy up the banking transactions of the Wachovia Corporation. 
Meanwhile Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalisiert the European financial company Fortis in part. 
After analysts with Barclays Capital, did not succeed in spite of the strained negotiations that occurred at the weekend and led to a rescue plan seemingly in stimulating the atmosphere on the markets. 
Since the economic situation keeps on worsening, is to be expected, that the demand for goods will sink, among other things after oil, wider. 
analysts The Deutsche Bank wrote investors in a note the forecasting for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates became extremely uncertain. 
We believe, they write that the goods markets will be also affected. 
"From the perspective of the goods markets we are worried most the most about that, whether the US expands American virus worldwide, in particular to China." 
The analysts of the bank corrected their expectations for the oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year down, and lowered their forecasts by 20% for the and gas prices for the year 2009. 
Team record through series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything after it in the last ones achteinhalb years more often than everyone other in the jet shirt accumulated. 
Then he saw on Sunday the second quarter in which the jets changed an unsuccessful game into a triumph train. 
"I have never yet seen something like that", Ellis said. 
After one slovenly game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals that corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began. 
When however Quarterback Brett Favres passport with Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown marked arrived, that the perfect prelude to an afternoon at that their developing cooperation a giant leap forward did. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two Touchdowns, the one time as an outside defender slipped and that other once 10 seconds in front of the end of the half. 
"I has me not especially tire", Coles about the passports says that to Coles went. 
"he a superplayer is. 
Our vote tuned regardless what the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles were playing call tracing the defence took Quarterback Kurt Warner from each other. 
Outside defender Darrelle Revis caught a verunglückten throw and changed it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Spare man Erik Smith came onto a different passport and caught it. 
Linebacker David Bowens guaranteed then for a loss of warner. 
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the maddest. 
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game than the jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely changed one 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 leadership. 
Those ones were the most points the jets ever in a quarter had achieved. 
when he was asked for describing the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter", answered? " 
Onto the answer to both, because the jets approved 21 points in the third quarter without achieving an only, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third. 
A lot of points were achieved quickly. " 
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia pointed again, why some hold him for the best distance runner of all time after it broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first Menschen to get the route from 42,2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2 03 59 previous result which it had achieved last year in Berlin improved Gebrselassie to his from 2:04:26 around 27 seconds. 
Gebrselassie, 35, set up in this way his 26th world record in his multifaceted career, in which it reaches at least a world cup title on every route of a kilometre until the marathon or made a world record. 
Last month Gebrselassie let out the olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear that it was afterwards maybe exaggerated that the air pollution could verschlimmern his asthma problems. 
Instead of this he enrolled itself for the race in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. 
Since railway stars as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya on long routes, is the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years fell around more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo obtained Costa there from Brazil in the year 1998 in Berlin with the result 2 06 05. 
05 has won. According to his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press informed, he would have had cramps two weeks ago in his Wade and it could not train therefore a week. 
Obviously is refreshed it after break and rustedly not come back. 
"I am so happier", he said to reporters. 
"Everything ran perfectly. 
I resumed the training a week ago and had some objections today still, nevertheless at the end what of everything super. " 
It was criticized for that - in particular in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from east Africa - that he orchestrates his running - races excessively, a lot of world - best Marathonstars general avoids, too very much onto the running - chiefs quits, when whether that would be a railroad race, and puts world records about the race. 
But this criticism hardly damages the size of Gebrselassies as distance runners. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Accompanied had reached the heart of the line in 1:02:04. 
04 reached. Two elite stars from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi kept on provoking Gebrselassie, after the speed makers had decreased. 
Something more than three miles before the finish did Gebrselassie his last start in order to separate from Kwambai that when second in 2:05:36 has arrived and so that his best time improved around almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi became third parties in 2:07:48. 
With women Irina Mikitenko closed initial from Kazakhstan and now Deutsche a remarkable year, when they with 2: 19 the seventh - fastest result of all time has shown. 
The world record of 2 15 25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
In Last spring Marathon had won that London surprisingly the 36 years old Mikitenko in 2:24:14. 
14 won. She missed the games in Beijing, because of problems, that were described as a back injury. However, it recovered in order to win in Berlin and to improve their best time in her third marathon five minutes. 
She planned their course skillfully when she made a quartet be pulled out of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first, but it overtook a quartet after 30 kilometres. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became Second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop was arriving from Kenya as third parties in 2:25:01. 
01 arrived. The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city in the very particular kind of 
a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro - American culture come is, a few miles remote of the twinkling, loud and gigantic driving, hidden between the outgrowths of leisure parks within a radius of Orlando. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is more as simply not to be described as Hurston did it in 1935: "this city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown skins 300 good swimmers do, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Come festival in Eatonville around the most famous authoress of the Harlem Renaissance commemorate. 
And nevertheless is and the city that describes it stays - and that they did to a tourist place of excursions, when she incorporated it into the Florida tour guide, that to the times of economic recession was produced of the federal writer project's - in a lot respect a place of very specific variety. 
Eatonville is so independently, solidly and privately as in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused to share their true idea with the white man in Florida this "so little white about us, that he does not know what escapes it. 
Even nowadays, in a year in that a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to one open conversation about race circumstances calls, it keeps on being many here, to be observed by mavericks. 
"we are considered very on that as our history told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. 
It must be right. " 
a long time was defined as a Paradox of triumph and the fight to Eatonville. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty line is twice as high as the national average. 
On the one hand it a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example is that one - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, that has their roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising, that people here both proud than are also on the guard. 
And so correctly the concerns began around Eatonville 'it image actually with Zora, as here all Hurston name. 
She introduced their home town in books that came of heart and was written in either to the world so as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five heels in the Florida guide changed the city that suits to the route 77 very near a road that through the oft - forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. 
Insolently as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston Leser to the shop of Eatonvilles led first mayor, Joe Clarke, and turned then to more private matters. 
"off the road to the left", she wrote ", were the brown - painted modern school, with its leafy gardens and playgrounds which Howard Miller always sees to although he can hardly read and write, knows. 
She mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Drinks of any kind sells and was-auch-immer to time areas fits." 
Only in just a few hundred words Hurston brought therefore Eatonville with self-government in combination, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was not a tour guide ganz sicher. 
In Fact this was not a portrait which was valued by all of them. 
"Zora the things described so, wie sie waren", so the 90 - year old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston immortalized, when them the men the songs about which sang their beauty that was fuller sexual innuendo summoned. 
She added: "Some people did not like this." 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly after the family had moved according to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus of Rome Franklin 77, remembered, that if Hurston came into the city roaredly, they this mostly without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers in a city the even today something onto their venerable clothing style imagines. 
According to Mr Franklin the majority of inhabitants were fascinated, wohingegen many it despised. 
"this people were always glad Zora to sight", Mr Franklin said. 
but "sie stayed never too longest", he added while it was swinging in his chair, on a to the back sited terrace that looks at the Sabelia See in which Hurston was christened according to all probability. 
When Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and its books out of print. 
Together with the bulk of the world it seemed to have forgotten to Eatonville. 
Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she became in fort Pierce, Florida, where it lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there was not no great ceremony, no public readings in the big style. 
"I thinks not, that they was published your contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood credit", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography above Hurston the 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a fünfspurige motorway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had pushed already the motorway 4 through the western outskirts of a town. 
The proposal was made when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history. 
Mandatory integration, among other things, had put an end the relatively idyllic isolation to the community. 
In the fifties the fight brought hatred against racial mixing into the community. 
"In this time a bunch of white boys came often and they flung oranges and stuff onto those ones off sitting people", Mr Franklin said. 
"it even once a woman gave the in this case was killed. 
You flung a watermelon from the car. " 
In 1955 Orlando Sentinel questioned Hurston in a writing onto that the demand of the Uppermost Court of Justice to force integration when they described his decision in the case Brown against the school council as "offensive instead of my race respecting". 
Residents say nowadays, that although the lifting of racial segregation was in a way positive, they the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance its young people weakened. 
"Black children were accustomed it, to be embraced - I remember that - one embraced his teacher at on the morning and one embraced his teacher at the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managerial directress of the non-profit group to the protection of the Eatonville Gemeinschaft. 
That could be received for so long erectly, she added until teachers and pupils did not come from the same place anymore. 
"One did not embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teacher - I mine there is a cultural divide available", Ms Nathiri said ". 
However, the civil rights contributed to place being created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists, that disregarded prejudices, so as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "as can refuse somebody the joy of my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker onto the path turned herself into Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of their fame. 
An a lot praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found five years later in the bookshelves, and made it renewed to a part of the American literature canon. 
The distance route project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter again once in the light of the stood. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw her as a Retterin. 
The community began festival in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston in order to show what the district with the construction of the motorway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and each January many return for the celebration. 
A few years later the district averted itself from his road construction plans. 
"this plans of a fünfspurigen distance route livened up the city, sped up the whole thing with top speed, woke genuine Citizen proud", Ms Nathiri said. 
Ms Boyd a little more simply squeezed it out: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the distance route project contributed to a modification of the selfpicture of the city. 
More and more Zugereiste came, so as Rachelle Munson, an attorney that goes into the church since 1993 here, and local began to estimate the past new. 
Eatonville was incorporated in 1998 into the national historic register. 
A new one-storeyed library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the again paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville still is a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city center of Orlandos it can feel sometimes as a rear lane in the summer rains, as small as then than it was founded only by 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(It is nowadays black to 90%.) 
External ones in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are handled often still with caution. 
For most interviews a approval in the run-up to is necessary and certain things - so as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of oldest church which was painted from a white and represents black men during the work in the fields - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Ms Jones, a courageous, teacher, selfconscious that their shielded community is misunderstood, with a penchant for Dunkelrot, fear still. 
And nevertheless, at the same time to which the Hurston-Festival became bigger, also an increased degree at internal pride was born. 
Particularly young people tend to seeing Eatonville like this as Hurston saw your whole race: wonderful, with all its problems, neither worse even better and just as proud, creative and industrious, fool around and mixes as any other race and nation group in America. 
It is the genuine love for this city that one in the voice of gentlemen Franklins nephew can hear, the 18 - year old Edwin Harvey that plans to return to the college according to Eatonville that could use some help according to it in order to work in the City Council or near the police. 
And even the juniors, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven year old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"this most people, that only think here gone on become:" Ach, this city is not anything in comparison with all the other ", Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after the church. 
"but if in fact one stops and its history long considers a moment, it is a very beautiful city. 
Here with us in New York one speaks Finanzlatein liquidly. 
At First Sight nothing changed itself. 
If tourists kept themselves away from the newsstands and the tremendous screens in the Times Square in Manhattan, they would not notice at all that they are right in a debacle. 
You would never believe that above their heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter which have the monopoly in New York have the worst horror working day daily since the markets of 1929. 
The suppliers shift still the metallenen ones with loud rattles Tea - Weigh along sidewalks and tablets carry that one with muffin for the breakfast meetings load are. 
Latin Americans shuffle still around between studio apartments, how human pack animals load with around the 50 ironed T-shirts that hang at a yoke - similar pole lying on their shoulders. 
Office workers wait still at themselves on the sidewalks being chimney states onto their Frühstücksbagel and a yellow taxi is to be gotten still impossibly on a day between 16 and 19 at. 
It did not feel at all as a crisis until I concluded Thursday in the afternoon due to all the talk of world to open a new savings account. 
although I had decided on putting Stammfiliale my in duty within a given time on the calm late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase were about 20 people queued. 
To answer not at the money is around money or to pay in, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order check books, tourists to the road to the department store Macy 'it ask and where new customer open accounts. 
Most in front of me, so I learned later from rigid, to my "personal bank employees with license", for the same reason as I queue stood. 
unlike me, however, they had lifted off already their saved from smaller banks, at places from where they swung, according to as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and states Iceland. 
You had answered money of so called Thrifts (a little of a building society resembling), cooperative banks and those local savings banks' that have only in a state ’ s subsidiaries and say that they treat their customers such as family. 
In Last year 15 of those banks are quietly and softly Pleite gone. 
In the last ones paar days Washington Mutual, a bank with plants at the level of $327 billion, in bankruptcy trustee went over and when New Yorkers drove last Friday home over the weekend, Wachovia, a further bank that has economizers to the value of $440 billions, in search of a saving customer, was. 
In the fear of a further collapse, the office and loading employees brought that in front of me outcropped their cash to a bank the than safe haven is looked at, a bank that for most rescue buying at Wall Street responsible is.

Muslemische graves discredited during much law in Austria 
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing of the Austrian right Liberal party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, to dispute member of the Belgian ones Pertei Vlaams importance, participate on Thursday, the 17th January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp, around which organization "Cities against Islamization" to represent. 
You take signs from traffic signa in the style on that one a mosque is shown, crossed out with a red line. 
The police accuse right wing of the grave violation on a muslimischen cemetery in Austria, at the same weekend at which far right parties record considerable profits during the parliamentary elections of the country. 
In the night from Friday this morning became more than 90 graves on the cemetery in Traun near Linz in one, according to police, organized action heavily damaged. 
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as David Stern onto some of the graves, however, criminal officials hold this for an attempt to disguise the motive of the extremists driven from the hatred onto Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear whether the incident stands in any way in connection with the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said it are "most deeply shakes" about the information of the grave violation, which occurred than the religious month of the muslimischen Ramadans closes in to the end. 
At the same time a Round Conscience Investigation waits in Austria after the country slid to the right in's yesterday parliamentary elections. 
The FPOE and the alliance for the Future, that the are almost 30% of the vote agreed with both parties directed far to the right, employed anti-immigrants law in their election campaign for a strict and some of their mottos were criticized by opponents as xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairperson of the FPOE who gained 18% of the vote supported a prohibition of head scarves and Burkas and did even his aversion to food which one brings generally with Islam in. 
During his last meeting in Vienna it spoke of one "European brotherhood" to the prevention of the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want to forbid the building of mosques and minarets with the argument, that this political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe are. 
Opinion polls and analyses that were carried out immediately after the election and that say that the extreme right of the politically powerful block in the country are, indicate that this new evolution on young voters that worries do around their future in the European Union is based.

` I receives the Masters behind the, in order to observe its character ', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no ruche, no costumes for the appearance. 
To get the nature of the tall flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and dedicate themselves to the interpretation around a loose appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I pop in private lives, into these moments that are strange for the public, I know when I can find typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or expressing - thickness of the hands that are worried because they will not step on the entrance for the personality. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' represent the German photographer Günter Bauer change - rich Theatralik of some stagings on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist dar. From this side it was still little known to the artists. 
With this proposal the photographer creates a special Ikonografie of the flamenco representation on different levels. 
The exhibition that appertains to the program of the month of the photograph of the flamenco ', reflect the international importance of flamenco that becomes increasingly greater from the day to day against', the artists declares and illustrates, that 'Flamenco-people' every arbitrary human being can be, however if one has a look at the photographs, the observer will notice notices so that it is not no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are in the situation to provide happiness on the stage passion, sadness, and to touch the public in this way. 
In order to be able to observe the personality of the artists, one does not have to make no photographs on the stage. 
Your personality and their character is in their hearts. 
What me was interested, to create 'a personal atmosphere that would make to observe the characters of the tallest flamenco masters with the camera for me possible'. 
Farmer, inspires from by the festival ` Cante de read Minas' it turned itself in the year 1997 onto a long journey, around singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital cameras to photograph. 
Thanks to the picture sorting work of the camera and the existing material, pictures that remind of classical photograph arose. 
The application of different stylistic resources destroys the classical basis of the picture by which the modernity and the idea how the Bauer understands flamenco are given the image: 'music with traditional roots, which changes and every day ueberrascht'. 
Those ones are not only of the dance, the song or the bridging game at themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character who encourages the public with its art. 
The search for the essential one, after one certain Something, which one in the form of the hearing, the existence's visible becomes, is and the fixed destination of this work that is presented to the El Fotómata in the next time in the gallery was. 
Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, confessed to personalities El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and other appertain to the close selection of almost 70 artists in flamenco among them, the were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will appear soon as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition. 
Bauer ’ s passion for the portraits provided with it, to pick up this idea two years ago once again and when 'Portrait of the veterans of the sport' to realize ('SportARTproject'). 
although the concepts of the project ` Flamenco-people 'different are, so the photographer adds ` it likes to me very, it is to photograph the people, to become acquainted with it and to move me into their life state, for a brief moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genus. 
You meet or meet people, personalities that you do not know sometimes at all, or they let to you for a few minutes alone in order to be able to make a photograph. 
Foreseen from these circumstances, as a photographer I attempt always my ideas to realize. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title ` Flamenco-people 'is in the gallery of the El Fotómata switched off, that in the street with the name la calle de la Mata is and runs parallel to the streets la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition up to the 16th October. 
Vargas Llosa confesses, that the Roma, which he just writes ` one daring 'is.

It was introduced by Félix Romeo and stated that he had a public in front of themselves which noticed that time was not given to the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humour sufficiently in order to be able to go through everything once again: how his appeal to the literature arose, that from ` extraordinary knight errantry ', from ` joy at the reading' and from ` more want to experience, than 'before that' follows; how he writes and ` discipline preserves', to complement 'mangle at inspiration' around ` this, his intense work with documentaries, many corrections and revisions that it does; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeal and which ` memory bilder 'it is, that form the basis for his stories. 
The hispanoamerikanische new writer granted, that it 'no way and manner' add, to measure at which one and from where one can know whether books change the life ', but I refuses me to believe in that, that the literature pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience is', said Vargas Llosa, who claims, that sie 'securities cause' and 'this people still more auseinander bringt', therefore I asked the writer 'the lightness not left' and 'this responsibility' for his appointment 'take over'.

` Sangre de mayo ': hero paper of Garci 
Inspires of 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci sets in 'Sangre de mayo' this overworked version of the famous revolt of Spaniards against the French dar. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million euros of investment for the knack works. 
In this way the Cineast attempted ` one lot of personalities and social analysis' Carci declared today to represent 'what he always admired at the factories of the famous new writer during the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the characters. 
` Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than zweieinhalb hours, is shown presented this Friday in cinemas and later at the sender Telemadrid as a four hour long miniseries. 
José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature of, insures, that to be thanks to this knack work ` Childhood dream 'into compliance with went. He has to owe this to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him to shoot a commemorating - film for the second century festival into Madrid on 2nd November three years ago of the autonomous community Madrid. Particularly, because the history on the basis of ` Episodios Nacionales' is based, that one accepted the task. 
The total contribution of 15 million that was set by the autonomous Madrid community for knack works offers Garci as it added that ` unique possibility 'with the aid of decorations and corresponding linings the image of the ` confused Spain, which selected the wrong chief for the fight,' because the people through the fight for the independence and under the domination of the Ferdinands of VII in arrears brachten. 
However, the Cineast feels sorry, that one with the funding how at ` Alatriste 'or ` Los fantasmas de Goya (twice so high when at ` Sangre de mayo') 'could not calculate, therefore some scenes could not be shot from the filmscript with Horacio Valcárcel, who almost his entire career cooperated to Garci with. 
For this reason, Garci has, that also film director in 'Volver a empezar' were, participated through his usual working method: he joined in the actors onto the stage, with which one must rehearse first before one starts turning and appeared for those ones that had not done any Casting he 'demuetigend' and 'exists' respect providing ', one part the profession's of the film director in giving aid in the theatre and in the movie theater in order to know what happens in the cinema industry in which one works. 
Many actors, onto which it in 'Sangre de mayo' struck, must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar - candidate in four nominations (from which he won one), thinks and assured that a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie does not represent to any of the three candidates that represent this year Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood. neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally neither the selected one Film 'Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci does not expect any distinctions. 
` at the beginning of you believe, that you work for the possibility of producing descendants, later you notice that it is only for the growth, and now you are in a satisfied way when one produced still have a film 'declared according to Garci more than 30 years career. 
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia 
A flamenco dancer from Seville admires a dancer, that also from Seville stamm. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin was her father (Georgina Valencia Valenzüla), it is born in the quarter of Triana and when it was three years old, your family moved to London. 
You were a dancer and expert for oriental dances. 
It had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was Buddhist, vegetarian and sat down for the abolition of the corset that restricted the free female movement. 
The life of this woman who left behind their mark during the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
` I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which appeared impossible to me. ' 
'we not to attempt to tell about their lives, to preserve' sonder their esprit, 'accept the flamenco dancer. 
Your dance basics helped me a lot into flamenco. 
'this Dance of the butterfly ’ s wings' kam me for example as Guajira before, or 'this dance the snake' as tango. 
Their dance was sensuous and it was said to me that my dance lies also in this aesthetic area ', she says. 
The orchestration reckons two exceptional work together: with Miguel Poveda, who once again will sing for Isabel at one of its ideas, as it also in ` La pürta abierta 'has done; and with flamenco champions of women Matilde Coral who wanted to work by way of exception together with one of their ex-pupils. 
'Matilde Tórtola a very mature personality, plays. 
I am happy because it was agreed to participate in my work, and I feel dear. ' 
The orchestration reckons musical composition and the Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, it ` übernimmt the role of the companion of the artists that were divas who he falls with in love again and again. ' 
In this plant one tells also in a certain way about by the life this woman, that in so far sited places as India, the United States or Russia and in addition in whole known to Europe became, although it usually lived in London. 
'I they wanted to call back in mind, because I think she is one of the women that have an enormous influence on a certain era and those one factories today none to appreciate more and them therefore still less white', Bayón claims. 
The idea finds today at 20: 30 in the theater Lope de Vega instead of. 
The publication of the book 'Diario de un pöta recién casado' include also the Triennium one 
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un pöta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen 'it Church (New York), at a place where, where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia got married, to celebrate a corresponding atmosphere, around planned activities on behalf of the andalusischen council for culture to carry out, around that offers' Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón '(2006-2008). The goal is the memory at the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the nobel prize for literature and the anniversary of death of the two of them. 
So ` this Triennium of Zenobia 'becomes' and 'closed' Juan Ramón 'with the new edition this work, with the international congress that occurs in New York with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition ` Juan Ramón Jiménez: ` Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and, after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now New York reached and during of the International Congress is presented. 
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un pöta recién casado' erhalten, that were handed over by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The objective is to make better known the person and the factory of the andalusischen world poet. 
The United States can introduce themselves badly without Paul Newman 
` sometimes God creates perfect figures. 
Paul Newman was one of them. ' 
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, that with it in 'Sensation reporter' cooperate, and of the idea of the US American movie theater being there then, which calm in the prick became, from whole America to Newman with his inspiring idea came and it followed. 
Look now, what it cost her to lend him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that it was very sick. 
In spite of that was a major blow for all of them. 
'what one sometimes feels, much more than an expression is, and now I have a tall friend', Robert Redford said crying ', my life and the largest Drolligkeiten of his life were my own country. 
No one was afraid neither not to make oneself ridiculous still to exaggerate. 
When 'father' of the movie theater's and the country it is died in a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the market collapse in which the suppressed selfvalue feeling of the US Americans on the desperate search for reasons in order to get back dignity is. 
If in this hard time without virtue only few people who one can admire stay, one does absolutely not have to be to Luis Cernuda like this in order to love Paul Newman. 
For all of them he embodied as it were a platonic ideal of beauty and the truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses both also profits: of the donation that devoted to the fight against the drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage to die at overdose up to the own brand of house - done and organic products. 
That all is a present for the country, in which it cost it a lot of trouble, to overcome a deadly food culture. 
A broad wave of surprise beats hugely over Hollywood without taking regardless onto nationalities and nationality. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that only a human being did not die but the entire. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscarpreisträger, said that the work with Newman was not more or less than the top his career. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia dared to designate Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
'us the largest of us all has leaving', confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of few, that attempt to dare today to live as Paul Newman lived: high demands on the rectitude receive a responsible private life, to lead far from the cameras away. 
That is not always simple or not even possible in the contemporary media jungle. 
But there is somebody who attempts it, and Paul Newman was an example of that. 
It could be separated a time and was after that married to Joanne Woodward, to whom it was loyal 50 years although certainly there were many opportunities not to be it. 
'Wozu I should eat a hamburger on the road if I have Filet at home?', he joked often himself. 
In the sky it will be proudly that on the earth his daughters have the same view as his supporters on that which is not absolutely usual in America. 
` of all big roles that he played onto none it was as proud as onto those ones of the loyal spouses, the loving father's, the attentive grandpa's and that of the philanthropist ', they say. 
For the Olympic Games the streets are deficient in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failing for 2012, nevertheless it can be in maybe 2016. 
But I ask to myself: ` are we for that prepares'? 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets I say that it is not right! 
It was designated as a perfect street, and according to in my opinion, she was the worst street with all for that and at that there was. 
That is natural a lot of rubbish if one paid attention to the assessment and I could check it something like that would not have come through unambiguously. 
But, let's go through from the outset onto everything. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket - getting that allows you when first go. 
It does not seem to me either to be bad, however if they make you already go ahead, they should give you also everything then (including crisp, in order to avoid the jams on the road). 
Therefore nevertheless not. 
Here they make you get just the ticket (the first nonsense to consist in going there only therefore) and (to a never-ending queues) there the surprise is! There was only the satirical T-shirt like in the size 'it' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) 
where do we live actually? 
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts of less substance? 
Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in comparison with the days on the street. 
already had a queue of at least 15 minutes is, foreseen of one having to go very early in order to get the chip, and, in addition, one must forget the schoolbag. 
The queuing lasted more than 35 minutes what is unintelligible in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected. 
Finally, as it was also to be expected, the streets caught at and we had not made our moving - bags lie before that even if it had succeeded once, but to fetch it back would be already more difficult. 
In addition looked it, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so that it resulted in the temptation, to organize a popular uprising and to raid the cottage. 
I believe, some 500 people become tomorrow certainly pneumonia have united and as I to become because of this crisp that I got not even to appear punctual during the classification, I can think already that the outcome was stamped wrongly. 
Natural, if one asked me for a perfect Road, I would never remember this road. 
So I believe, we will dream still long about a city that is good for the Olympic Games prepared 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
on this' Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes of WITH, Microsoft presented the progress of the new picture labelling system and the human being communication, to order a being of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence that, however, is capable, it unites to finish primitive work, as such a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft that is a distance designer in order to move on the campus of the company). The system pays attention to what hears it during the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and face identification system, can this' Rezeptionistin 'recognition, how many people are in the area, who they are and who they remind, as they were dressed can listen and the words their entertainment understand. 
It can classify also present into the groups after the talks. 
In the presentation video bemerkt 'this Rezeptionistin' one third person, however she understands that this person to the group that leads conversation with it is not corresponding, and that also no farm workers is. 
She asks about whether the person wants to visit anyone here and answers that she will soon listen. 
All without the blue Screenshot 
impressing 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things which it can be concentrated on, for example onto the next version of their operating system of Windows. 
This week one talked very superficially about the change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many bound programs. 
Steve Ballmer found, that if the computer were endowed with the most necessary instead of filling it with the commercial waste so they would function five times more quickly. Human being, stem, that will be only for the Few ones. 
Everything is just a statement if one considers that Microsoft in Windows versions one or other function and 'Extras' add. 
The shift is worthwhile 
The Microsoft has right, the operating system loses importance by degrees, exactly as the software. 
When Google chromium appeared in the network, that was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Sent many referred to the browser not being an operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will be always necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. 
The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his her husband if it is a question of informing his mother-in-law of something. 
That is right. 
The system will never disappear, however one must at his' death ', not as an absolute, but as relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give each time less attention to the operating system, for that more the web browser. 
The computer exports only started, around the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium and every day we spend more time at the surfing, than in the environment this' window '. 
what does the half serve for in the computers of existing applications? 
Little is more 
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista must. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, complicated little. 
The interest of Microsoft exists more in integrating his on-line services that then can become, finally, the alternative to Google. 
In the reality they need that, without doubt. I bring a small example of that. 
I did the photograph of this place in talking - moon in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
on the soft drink machine is a shield attaches: 'your search. Ours future'. A request prints, to use own tool for online search. 
In 2006 an independent study came at the end of, that the 66% of the employees at Microsoft, Google for the research on the network was useful. 
After all, last week was also confirmed, that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 is guessed in the delay. 
It does not become initially, but at the end of 2009 appear, rather even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks to bring the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously on the mark. 
Every day the telephone changes itself in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in ` Blood are slipping moon 'from Edward Zwick, just the same as Al Pacino in ` this godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola. Simultaneously it appertains to lining of a well built priest. 
if we start counting the innumerable star appearances, so we can back onto the image of a very strong man, to access with a peaked beard that had lifted heavyweights in a travelling circus. 
Basically, that is a typically masculine T-shirt of cotton, sleeveless and cut. 
The English-speaking ones name it ` tank '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses, however all other brands. 
Firstly, because of his wonderful name, although they is in the close circle 'Marcel' genannt. The legend tells, that the name origin is joined with sport and of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf, come. 
` La Marcel 'towers above all because of its excellent cotton, because of his distinguishing unisex reduction and a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail at the neckline is characterized by. 
and respect, the Belgian company does not concentrate only on the production of ` tanks'. 
You have also college Sweatshirts, boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, trousers of cotton, T-shirts with stripes, Babies Mini shorts

The best Premium of the fashion 
Probably there was not any more suitable place on the world than Paris, in order to present a Premium of the fashion and there were probably no considerably excellent fashion designers and Bonvivanten as Valentino. 
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition ` electroluminescent display Bóton mango Fashion Adwards' for to promote and international increase of young fashion talents. 
This is marked with cash prize at the level of 300 000 Euro. 
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw yesterday their drawings in the shop window of the mango branch on boulevard Haussmann Nummer 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement. 
After all, that is the second-largest business of the company in Europe and was opened recently. A selling space of 1 335 metres offers ².

1001 council against stress 
There is in not 1000, but one possibility more, in order to forget chaotic to us fast daily lives. 
And if it is also few, they are all gathered in a book in which it stands as one comes to defuse. The book comes into the bookshops on 30th September. 
The alarm is a punishment if it rings at 7 a.m. in the morning, but the idea appears even worse, again in the hectic rhythm, that the current life requires to come only. 
The office is called the tension and the computers, that lead to the back. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is not one and not to oppose two methods, around the daily exhaustion and the problems how one switches off from the world. 
The figure increases, however, no more and not less than to 1001 at. 
Next to Yoga - positions, the classical massage or Spa - processing, Susannah Marriott represents in the book the whole list of the possibilities that are adapted onto the taste and the time every individual. 
The work against the stress is called ` 1001 opportunities to relax 'and so the rest that the book provides comes into the bookshops of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
who thinks that it is impossible to achieve the rest in the fields as work with help of personal contacts so this manual refutes such a believing. 
In addition the methods are offered, as one stays in contact with nature or suggested the 100% natural prescriptions that lead to defuse. 
To restore, when the adrenaline does not climb up anymore in your veins, around balance of the body and the stress became a problem, so the moment came to sit down onto the sofa, to switch off the brain and to focus on the read. 
Talking in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I mean not those ones who wake up and tell something which happened on the day in front of that to us in this case, but the children who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, most at best you will have been scared, but in the reality that does not have any importance. 
That is a positive sleep disturbance which is mentioned the speech in the sleep. 
It is quite spread, particularly with among children and young people. 
Certainly, it was told to more than one by you that you spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can occur sometimes (once in the life, for example, how during the high fever), or regular (every day, a time per week, once a month), on the next day the child can not remember anything. 
There is not any only reason which causes this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena are searched in the sleep, as nightmares, panic-stricken fear at night, Enuresis noctura (Bed - Wet at night), searched are in the sleep, however there is not any reason for that. 
How we mentioned it already formerly, it can lie at very high fiber, stress situations or excessive demands. 
In Any Case, that is a little bit investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks calmly in individual words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (Shouts, wines long debates). 
In the cases if the comment is very intense it is recommended to observe the child that causes fear and is achieved in this way and to make be advised with a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem. 
We said that it is a positive disruption, therefore it is not handled, it is united with another sleep trouble, which can be handled (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What one can do is, one series of simple preventative measures would go on: 
Attempt not to excite the child before the sleeping. 
Therefore, calm game for the child select and stressige channels that terribly and a little are too wild avoid. 
With the nervous children who expansions are recommended to extension methods in order to help them to get a certain amount inner calm can be used. 
That helps the child with sleeping calmly. 
If the talk occurs in the sleep once, attempts to preserve the rest. 
Thinks, that it is harmless for the child and on the next day will not be able to remember anything that happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not wake it on. 
That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, sleeps it, therefore it rests. 
Think of that if it is proved according to a few phenomena verängstigt, so it is recommended to make oneself be advised or to find out what is the reason the baby has for the fear. 
if they understand what does not say it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure, in order to carry out an interrogation and to figure out more information. 
So you will not be able to achieve anything in this way, because if the baby sleeps, is unconscious it and can not think about that. 
In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says that, therefore they are cautious with the interpretation of the information and that ends that draws her from that. 
Maybe, do not say it to the child, that to hear you that at night and to know his secrets. 
Not even as joke. 
That causes a lot of fear. 
Therefore, does not do you no concerns, it is not anything bad, that is a moment that lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhäusern. final 
To a long haul is to Illhäusern on the pitch at last again on course for success. 
Without much effort erspielten the yellow blacks numerous delude opportunities and managed to move one of them, and to gain so the game. 
To show the speed of this meeting in the case of which the attacker had bothered their skills was not very high. 
After a first attack of the public captain Kauffmann whose distance shot passed on the corner the game should dominate Illhäusern with ease, and first Fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high-pass filter, and Romain with a shot with the foot top, succeeded by turns in provoking the defence of Denmark. 
The opponents team blocked in the area medium and let through only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive with at first two delude opportunities erkämpften by Riahi and temporal, and to accept now after that with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais that stood exactly correctly around a ball that had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt again. 
Nevertheless the illhäusische scorer should long not be able to enjoy his luck and to be sent onto the bank through which his team-mates had to play numerical inferiorly about 12 minutes later. 
Denmark, however, did not know this use and did not counter an illhäusischen Eleven with any great problems that only a little withdrew, around their defence to 'blocking', except for in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed according to a big mess very near at the standard.

Obama, winner to points in the first TV duel 
Onto the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday a further one followed John McCain or Barack Obama in order to find out who emerged as a winner out of that. 
How expected the QGs for to the election announced both the republicans' and the democrats' their own victory in this TV duel that should be pursued by a third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen estimates, that John McCains performance, although absolutely considerable, not ` brilliant 'enough was in order to make for him possible still to stop his drop in the parliamentary questions five weeks before the presidential elections. 
The Gallup - institute by which on Saturday an opinion poll which lies in front according to Obama by five points (49% to 44% for McCain) was published thinks that the democrat does the better figure unambiguously. 
at the still irresolute voters, that is the ones which it depends on now, Obama with 39% emerged as a winner out of the polls while according to a CBS inquiry 25% of them McCain are seeing as winner. 
Obama should his margin on Thursday with the good performance, that of its competitors Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin, is expected, to be able to confirm 
` it a mistake would be, to underestimate it. 
You have good instincts', this weekend Bill Clinton warned, however. 
The seventy Year Old McCain did not stop moving his indisputable experience into the fore on the field of foreign policy and in this case very clear the ` naivety 'of his opponent with regard to these questions underline, that formed the center of this first TV duel. 
'Senator Obama seems to understand not, that.', it accentuated several to times. 
` I believes not, that senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge in order to become president 'he in addition insured. 
A target, that since yesterday into that one republican electoral advertisements is preached. 
Obama itself stressed that it represents the future. 
He was expressed shortly and exactly without making oneself be brought from the version. 
It moved his ability into the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the picture that has the world of the United States. 
` McCain still 'always not', Obama 'has understood' on the other hand already ', this weekend put a democratic electoral advertisement against not having understood the full extent of the crisis in the Republicans was reproached that on that ` American from the street' burdens. 
` during the 90 minutes of the debate John McCain had to say a lot of things about me, however nothing about you ', Obama denounced yesterday before 20.000 people that had met on the occasion of an electoral meeting in Nord-Carolina in flowing rain. 
He did not mention not even the words ` middle class' or ` worker '.' this financial crisis provides Obama that those ones hold for most suitable to save the economy even still on the fringe of the abyss to Americans a clear advantage. 
` this coming week could represent a decisive turning point, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the administration Clinton, that one compared ` best economical instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate the current one is crises' this final judgment of a eight years bad economic policies, that moved by George Bush and of senator McCain supported is'. 
after it had stressed once again that it would even presumably create it the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the volatility at the rampart to lower Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out on the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable vigor, together with the introduction of a health insurance scheme, for it having top priority there. 
McCain on the other hand wanted to establish a plant to 2030 from 45 nuclear power stations.

` credit you notice, that in Minsk an election occurred '? 
Youthful and opposition ell demonstrated Sunday Evening on the key place of Belarus capital in order to refuse the results of the parliamentary elections already in advance. 
A few hundred people met Sunday Evening since closure of polling stations on the market place of Minsk in order to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections. 
Although still no result had been announced many young people had come in order to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ` this dictator is supposed 'to resign'. 
Some admit that they did not choose first at all: 'what that is useful, if nevertheless they do always with my voice, what they woolen', a young person says. 
You do not believe that the regime which showed the foreign observers itself in the best light in order to resume the negotiations with the European Union is ready for carrying out a democratic change. 
The sanctions, under that the Not give of visas for 40 leading Byelorussian personalities and the aufeis off-its-feet of certain capabilities, could be disconnected if these elections were assessed by the observers as a clean. 
According to the opposition they were not it. 
` we were impossible of the commissions' and our observers were not allowed 'to participate' in the count ', pitied Juri Potemkin, press officers of the Union Democratic, one heterogeneous merger of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the presidential elections 2006 and chiefs of the pros Europe movement, stresses, because it is important who counts out who vote and with us that is the executive. 
if members of the opposition move in parliament then because they were appointed and not elected. 
But it went to the parliament can mean air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals. 
The opposition is it therefore guiltily to interfere in the political game because ` this dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy that got into debt strongly opposite Russia gets into a crisis and we do not reform to ourselves, we run danger to become a protectorate Russia. 
Now, we want 'to be' independent '. 
The opposition fears that the Organisation does not recognize the election as valid for Security and cooperation in Europe which pursued the voting process. 
It stresses that the turnout figures appear too highly, and that the expansion of the voice delivery in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) smoothed the way for any kind of manipulation. 
'credit you notice, that an election occurred?, the chief of the social democrats asks to Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners, that in August this of year were released. 
Nobody was in the polling stations. 
and there will be a maximum five members to of the opposition in parliament, and indeed those ones that correspond to the views of the government at the ehesten one. 
The quiet of the night sinks again over the October place. 
On televison president Lukachenko and members of the central election commission congratulate themselves on their success. 
Meeting - Of from the blood, that again secure became 
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary their creation yesterday, and their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to be pleased, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And particularly she retrieved the confidence of the public which had been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980th and 1990th years heavily. 
As one knows, the national blood reserves managed from the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980th years with the HIV and hepatitis C virus. 
Faced with this tragedy and the discontent public the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 an investigation public, seen through the judge Horace Krever that to the goal it had to bring light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to prevent to elaborate directives, around a renewed disaster of this type of. 
while judge Krever was still hesitating with giving his report several provinces set then a committee onto the legs that aim was to develop a new system to the administration of blood in Canada it. 
In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this task. 
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order to supply the other provinces and the two territories. 
` 1998 when Hema-Quebec started their work hardly any 38% of people had confidence into the blood preserve system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Through the enormous efforts around the safety of the blood to improve and through the work on this field during the following years, we have the confidence of the recover ', they says, before it stresses proudly, that at the beginning of 2008 in the meantime almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. 
Dr. Décary keeps, however, in the consciousness, that ` confidence something extremely brittle is'. 
Since their foundation on 28th September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. 
At this time we lived through the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman that holds the leadership since the creation in 1998 tells. 
'and we had not the slightest idea, whether the disease could be transferred via the blood. 
Therefore we referred to one of the key directives of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which one uses exclusion measures if one does not know this that leads to death unavoidably and if an illness that is expressed through a degeneration of the brain continues only slowly as it is the case obviously during the Creutzfeldt Jakob illness. 
Therefore one did not accept in April 1999 any blood of persons who had detained themselves longer since 1980 than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, few years ago it was proved without any doubt that this disease will transfer via the blood. 
So this event showed us that the principle of the caution that we used absolutely has a purpose. 
In 1999 a much more precise technique for the recognition of HIV appeared on the market: To prove the Nukleinsäure tests (NST) that facilitate it directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case at the up to now used tests. 
The NST made it possible to reduce the incubation period that between the time when, to which the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, occurs, the specialist declares. 
This time could be reduced to a period by little as a week. 
The risk became like this that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, considerably reduced. 
These improvements facilitated it, the risk, to assign AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in considerable extent. 
Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs danger, with HIV infected blood keep. 
` in other words that is called, that one would have to distribute 12 million blood conserves before somebody was infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 and 500 blood every year, it would last more than 24 years before a case occurs with the HIV about a blood conserve transferred. 
I believe, that one can feel well in this case nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes a blood transfusion around the health reconstruct ', the direction head of Hema-Quebec means. 
` our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products to receive. 
One never knows how germs can reach into the system. 
Only in last year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island Reunion, which will transfer, just the same as the west Nile virus, through insects on the blood. 
We must 'control' constant ', Dr. Décary goes on before it stresses that Hema-Quebec must in addition provide a secure supply next to sufficient supply. 
` this demand climbs, because the population ages. 
Since the treatments for cancer is more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood cells or blood platelets. 
The of the population affects also the blood donor net, to which on average only 3% the to the blood donations appertain appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. 
In this case can every healthy person, 18 years or older is and the eligibility criteria fulfills, to donate every 56 days to blood six times in the year. 
On average 14% of the persons that provide their blood, do not accept, because for example fell with AIDS or malaria ill, and who traveled to a country are spread in which malaria is, becomes for a year of the blood donations impossible. 
` with these 3% we create it, to receive an inventory that satisfies the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of stockpiles is very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donor network if they can become older and not donate no blood more. 
It is heavy to hold it and to bring it to becoming regular donors to convince the people of donating blood particularly, however. 
The life is nowadays so hectic that one finds the time rarely an hour at the to transfer blood donations', Francine Décary feels sorry. 
With an annual budget of 297 million $Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood, but also human tissues, under that Knochentransplantate, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively in the case of hard fire injuries. 
These tissues are examined, worked and frozen before they become at Hema-Quebec zwischengelagert that manages also the single public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
There is rich blood at stem cells in the umbilical cord that formerly was considered as biomedical waste, which can be used for that, difficult illnesses, as for example leukemia, to handle. 
` before some weeks we the occlusion of our one thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we celebrated to intend to lose annually more than a thousand. 
'we should begin presumably at the beginning of next year so that, it for transplantation available put', Dr. Décary keeps on declaring, that this programme the umbilical cord blood - abnahme than very liked describes. 
'a lot of mothers are convinced by that, no access to that to credit', denn Hema-Quebec lack the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - impact in the semi-final

He received stormy applause. 
Charest backs on the north 
The prime minister does not exclude to introduce still before end of the year elections. 
As soon as the General Assembly was to of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday into Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) attempts to be elected in the contemporary partial choice, after jean renewal coupon. 
'this process of our last great border in the North displacement': This is the long-term destination that Jean Charest presented to Quebecs yesterday with visual means with the general assembly of the Liberal Party in Levis at what it completely followed the guidelines. 
During his lecture a type picture factory was projected behind it. 
On three giant screens spectacular pictures of hydropower stations, mines, turned from Quebec in ` Google Maps' maps, and so forth, considers. 
great as during the Legislature. 
Opposite the press the prime minister refused after all to exclude that his agenda is very full that it will keep off the elections this autumn even if he made be announced. 
this' Plan north 'is the fourth element one' vision ', which the prime minister supposedly has for Quebec, indeed that of one' new economic area ', the one agreement with France regarding, an accord between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario designates. 
Although it was mentioned recently frequently in the speeches of the prime minister, the aperture of the North was - the northern field on the 49sten degree of latitude - still not been ever subject of a presentation. 
The prime minister restricted himself to that, however, declare, why the north 'one jewel with enormous potential' were, named, however, not a date, no investment figures or exact priorities for the next projects. 
At most some views on which could be worked on more: Favored by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure particularly at the water vigor, at the forest, but especially at the mining industry sector. 
According to the list gentlemen Charests the north has ` coin, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even brillants'. 
This ` field twice as large as France '` is in our proximity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our proximity, it is in us' it stressed, as in order to show clearly that he seeks to realize a national founder dream. 
Quebec increased very much through his connection with the North, it stressed: the street to the gold into Abitibi the technology of Quebec, the James bay. 
'it appertains us, it is ours future', he added to consider after his having inserted a theatrical break around the huge card behind itself. 
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, closes a part that Quebec always demanded from Labrador, the prime minister declared opposite the press. 
` this a traditional attitude that all governments pursued is. 
There is a borderline at which there is not no agreement since a very long time if the opportunity is offered I become this attitude behalf on of the government again einnehmen ', he declared. 
In addition, ` with the climate change we must reconsider 'our vision of the North again, he declared and spoke over the north-west arcade that will be passable due to the ice varnishes the whole year. 
Against this new geopolitical context the prime minister thinks that almost it is a duty to fill the area. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous people and the Inuits? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very cautiously, and that they would profit by this project particularly the young. 
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (more formerly pekistischer representatives of Ungava) initiated already discussions near approximately 30 communities. 
A ministerial committee guided by Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) takes an important role started the work. 
The prime minister does not exclude a great house, 'not absolute one peak', however an opportunity, "to create" at this' one a common vision becomes'. 
The development of the North will go by the way ahead in agreement with the principles of sustainable development. 
the plan north becomes ` besprochen, 'to be' controlled and environment - protecting ', he promised. 
Jean Charest described this' vision ', as if she were a continuation of those of the Liberal prime minister that was before it in office. 
` as the liberals, which were before us in office, we thought, around the challenges in new Growth - and to change Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was after all one of the again and again raised topics of the weekend which was revealed to of the party leadership on Friday with a great cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the through Jean Lesage. 
One of the accepted decisions plans to rename the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm. 
` of Godbout that has to create Hydro-Quebec to determine the future to Bourassa that did the James bay, our party always knew, over Lesage that achieved the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water current ', declared Jean Charest. 
Opposite the press he took Bezug onto another, this time conservative project, and indeed on the program 'Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
With Respect to the project hydroelectric dams Eastmain1a-Ruper, markedly Mr Charest, that the operation is planned for 2012. 
'this stays among us, however I plan, in this case to his', he entrusted his Margaret Beckett with what caused storms of applause at those. 
The prime minister that said in April that it would give 2008, and certainly also 2009, no elections, the possibility to keep off an election this autumn, which is possible to him here from by law, did not exclude in fact yet. 
It stresses that his agenda, however, is full particularly because of a mission of the community council in China and a peak between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly on weekend provided the liberal a party leader with a platform from nationalistischen plans, particularly from ` this constitution concerning destinations' that were accepted without further: The PLQ completely requires particularly the recognition the ` special feature of Quebec 'in the Constitution. 
She would also like, that Quebec appoints members of the council of the Canadian Broadcasting and telecommunications, and that these have a veto concerning the decisions made in Quebec. 
On the part of the opposition the guidelines of the plan were picked up North with scepticism. 
The chief of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, brought out the politics for the evolution of the Nord-du-Quebec which the government Landry 2001 introduced again. 
According to it the liberal government refrained from using these when it came onto to power in 2003. 
If she had done it ', wae ren we today already a lot weiter', woman of Marois judged to Françoise Mercure at the page of their candidate in jean renewal coupon (where the election occurs today). 
The ADQ spoke out for supporting north adopt a plan through the government. 
` but what we want, it is that this' does not 'become' only a great idea, the party leader Sébastien Proulx declared in representation for Mario Dumont, who today comes back from the vacation. 
The letter - A dishonored country 
Mr Vic Töws, EX - 'justice' - Minister (which irony) it was in the cabinet Harper, that last summer was taken to say above Louise Arbour the liberty it is one 'Disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman, not to end ones wanting fight for the justice has led and earned all our admiration to cover so with outrage so much testifies about the people the prime minister, as above Stephen Parker itself. 
We have to do it here with a government, that than only from all the affected countries their compatriot caught in concentration camps Guantanamo not home has gotten. 
A government which not even considers that Omar Khadr was still a young man when the things which he is reproached for happened. 
The single government, that in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and makes a child soldiers vegetate under inhumane conditions. 
To assess the only one who lowers itself to a justice parody around the fault of the defendants. 
We call ourselves into remember, that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers plead for getting Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada. 
Exactly this government shuts also the eyes in front of torture: It interests her little that a young adult will have broken after so many years the ordeal certainly forever psychologically. 
We are not yet conscious of that to ourselves, but we experience just an insidious curtailment of our rights here our freedom and ours' democracies', this word that supports to Harper here continuously as a flag for itself, and that rings from his mouth so meaninglessly. 
The time in which there is not no morality more came therefore: One may maltreat a Canadian citizens randomly, torment a Canadian citizen and lock up a Canadian citizen, completely according to discretion of a head of the government that is supported only by the minority until today (he completely likes to belong after the 14th October to minority...). 
Many voters believe to find their salvation near a party which preaches about virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government renounced of what defined the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Töws, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere different. 
Free view - The orwellsche speech of Barrick Gold 
Le Devoir published in its edition of the 17th September a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold. 
This confirms, and hunts in this case a Orwellian, that the largest gold extraction society of the world strove for a libel destitute publishing house more than six million against three authors and one small, with the destination, to start 'transparent debate' one ` public. 
if it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they judge not the truth, particularly not in the case of slander complaints, but the law. 
As expects, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr Garver. 
Because for Barrick Gold it is to lead the kind, best to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent an opinion countered theirs with public debate one. 
Very same as the process goes out that authors and the editor of the book considerable sums that are paid to of the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible pockets will have to distribute noir Canada in order to prepare their defence and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers. 
The tactic in these unequal fight is by the way often to ruin the defenders in order to force an agreed regulation that makes the other side mouth - dead and in addition deters everyone that risks it renewed with the question to deal. 
If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their vision of things before the of public opinion. 
In the contrast to what in many that one is to countries in which Barrick Gold works gang und gäbe debates are usually delivered in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through stick blows. 
It would have sufficed therefore, when the gold mine their books and files disclosed and would have opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent checking - teams that could have brought light into this issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to in support of the authors aside from noir Canada with a hand. 
Mr Garver could declare maybe, as it simultaneously about one ` public 'Debate can ask and to disregard but the views very this in this case? 
Apparently this word contains in the world of the vice-presidents only the on a large-scale paid attorneys, and not the community all Canadians; a very beautifully restricted viewpoint of the term. 
In a democracy even the detractors have to speak the right. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not wants to understand - it is that the public that supports the authors and editors of noir Canada does this particularly therefore because she refuses the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is ready for listening to Barrick and judging, however, on the basis of a civilized replacement of arguments, and not in a framework, which many perceive as silence complaint (in the course this' public debate 'has Barrick Gold just a request addressed to the authors from noir Canada, in which it demands from them, not to use this term more.). 
Foreseen from the surrealen speech from Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung that are fundamental for any democratic society. 
She completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss about facts and interpretations which form the basis of the intellectual work. 
To investigate issues, when it is impossible in a country like Canada, and to discuss, which the rich do this world do not like, who otherwise can do that then? 
If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public and open debate, it could lead these in her following the scientific norms which were used by the authors of noir Canada. 
It has a right to answer. 
To get the on-campus environment to which we belong, white for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows clearly that she does not have no desire for a transparent debate, unlike what she sets. 
This is a loss for the university world, just the same as for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints. 
Rescue operation for the Wall Street - democrats and republicans get on 
The administration Bush and the leading congress representatives, Republicans and democrats equally, came yesterday at last to an agreement about the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan above 700 billion United States dollars which is supposed to stop the financial crisis which already since months shakes Wall Street must still be accepted from the two congress chambers. 
methods Continue using their existing ’ are: A better control of the members of the practical application of the plan new mechanisms, in order to safeguard the redemption of the used public money, new orders, in order to dam the number of the houses impounded due to debt arrears, as well as the right to control the salaries that are paid to the executives of the companies. 
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the chamber of deputies Nancy Pelosi, and in the negotiations representative the republican, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, midnight the good news, unites according to minutes after a two-day these marathon negotiations. 
'we great progress towards an agreement have done, that to be market - effective becomes', the representative of the administration declared Bush, Henry Paulson. 
` it everything happened, to protect 'around the real economy and the American nation in front of the crisis of course at Wall Street, the Democrat declared. 
'this the basic point is: If we do not do that, becomes that trauma, the chaos and the balances in the daily lives of Americans enormous his', the republican Judd Gregg declared. 
The negotiations had sped up during the last two hours, for fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failing onto the mood of investors. 
The period of time which had been agreed was the market opening this morning. 
The two American premiership candidates that participated in the negotiations first late rather showed themselves than proponents of the agreement without failing, however, to be expressed their dissatisfaction about that one must hit they in these extreme way. 
The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain decrees for agreement, particularly such that is supposed to make to keep their homes for the owners possible it, and such that the salaries of the executives of the enterprises saved by state concern. 
` if one asks the taxpayer for that, to take extraordinary measures due to of the irresponsibility certain people, is not that anything which one could congratulate oneself on. 
However these measures are necessary ', he declared on the American television channels. 
When it was asked on another channel, whether he will vote for the suggested plan, his republican opponent John McCain answered: ` I would know with pleasure first the details, however I hopes it. 
` this guiding principles that I read [to show], that this is a matter, that we all will have to digest, and with that one we are able to get on. 
The option, not to do anything at all, is very simply not acceptable ', he said. 
The 700 billion the action plan is achieved on that, with the money 'taxpayers 
It comes 14 months after a crisis, activated by the bursting of an immovable bulrush, that at first for the collapse the risk - rich mortgage credit (subunison) led, before they stretched loans' more spread onto other forms (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of the financial clout and into the ruin of the banks and financial institutions ended. 
A group of Republican member was it, that made the first attempt to reach agreement fail last week. 
Since the democrats accepted, that certain ` poisonous' To be supposed to be safeguarded assets of societies in trouble only from the government and to be bought for Aktiva of the societies, one believes the dead-end street escape. 
In order to round off the visual angles for all in Congress, one added also a decree that says that it can raise new taxes then if the government with this program should do losses within five years in order to get back so their used capital. 
The new plan plans the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion that further 100 billion can join if the president looks it for necessary. 
The extra 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by Congress. 
In return for his aid receives Washington parts at the supplementary enterprises that are to him worth in the case of win dividends, and that it can sell again if the storm has moved by. 
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the seizure procedures concerning the apartments which are tied to the mortgage loans affected from this plan, and in addition to set periods of time for the redemption and the compensations which are paid to the executives of the affected enterprises. 
The developers of the plan would have it with pleasure, that the chamber of deputies already votes on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts is not secure that your plan will get green light yet. 
In fact more votes arose yesterday against this intention, both on the part of the Republicans as well the Democrats. 
` whole obvious Washington understands us not ', the republican Scott Garett, member of the financial commission of the chamber, declared to his constituents. 
` yes, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not the one that consists in that the taxpayers the foot bill to bitten '. 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, conductor of a group in Congress, this' this Kaukus the sceptic 'genannt becomes, represents the situation differently, comes, however, to the same conclusion. 
` four a hundred excellent economy professors, under that three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us in order to communicate too: We ask the congress for not making oneself be put under pressure, and considering carefully what path is to be taken ', it declared yesterday. 
At the Same Time we got in Europe the evidence that it is a question of a worldwide crisis once again. 
With an emergency board the three Beneluxländer announced Fortis the partial nationalisation to of the banking group should imply for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion United States dollars). 
The intervening of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that she that is in deep trouble would refrain from buying up their Konkurrentin since she lost 2 billion euros (2,9 billion United States dollars) in the crisis by high-risk property loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and belongs to the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers. 
'That is not a lost money, the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos declared yesterday. 
For To compensate we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly now what the savers and households estimate since uncertain times announce themselves. 
During that time the British government was to nationalize another bank brought from the financial crisis in dire straits on the other side of the just in this case. 
According to the English press the government would take over all running credits near the Bradford and Bringley bank, of that more than 41 billion (75,5 billion United States dollars) from borrowing capabilities. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy up the branches and the customer accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be according to Northern Rock the second bank to have to nationalize the British government since the beginning this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged icon 
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, nobody would say, its weakness. 
had the American actor with the charming smile freed from the narzisstischen mirror? 
Really and no. 
His delicacy, his sensitivity and an obvious talent held it presumably in the same way far from a predominance which brings the really terrible monster to on the world. 
But which big continuous runner! 
The Paul Newman late on Friday in the age of 83 years at the results of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American movie theater that one it golden years. 
It was less monumental than Brando, that it resembled and for that one it was for a long time one kind of rival across the which has moved screen, more careful in his play, in this case secure also more brittlely, but just as an apostle of freedom and the exploding of dramaturgischer conventions. 
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children. 
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jews and an ungarischstämmigen mother. 
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise from its European roots. 
Without excessive egos utmost sign. 
Because a whole country that was in love in the Self-made-man reflected in it again into the fighter that was hurt in the Pacific war in the shoot-out the beginning of the fifties of play art in Yale studied and "visited" then the Actor 'it studio in New York, before it success the theatre, on televison and soon also in the movie theater had. 
Also the driver that became in 1979 during the 24 - hour - race of Mans Zweiter, and in addition a gender symbol was now this man that fought for the civil rights although it lived in a showing - relationship together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958. 
With it disappear also the unknown facets of this mysterious, holding back, engaged and opposite the Glamour of the show business of over-sensitive star whose puzzle one will completely never solve. 
A decent man, in the true sense of the word. 
The death Paul Newman's moved the cinema connoisseurs into frenzy this weekend while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were being played. 
More than half a century of American film industry in constant change pulls with it by. 
There the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) into the memory, and the young man that rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into The cat on the hot sheet steel roof that was made a film in 1958 of Tennessee of Williams pushes himself again. 
A memory being much shorter back (1990) is called in an awake way, that onto his sensitive gentleman bridge that is disturbed in his high age of a wedding that did not keep all its promises. 
There was So many other Paul Newman's in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful dirt) of Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, after whose death was resumed and that Newman made correctly known in 1956. 
This agreeable crook in the outstanding The Sting (The chief attraction) who was honored with the Oscar in 1973 for the best film. 
As an embittered and vindictive billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
Through this face by the Times, he was that. 
Still it. 
In his course of life eras unite. 
The youth knows it, as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team, particularly from the cult film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977). 
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers to Coen. 
With a last role 2003 as a godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes the circle closed. 
Unlike several movie theater legends, that early enough from the film world have withdrawn, Newman should stay long in the saddle, and betray in this case Hollywood, his ability, his ceremonial expenditure and his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand taverniers saw it, not without humour, as a living challenge onto that 'Underplaying', than he judged his far too expression - strong services. 
The preserve was not always easy for the fine Paul Newman, that the roles zuflogen for a long time only so. 
He played, however, rare Sunnyboys as a maverick: Neurotic, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate with whose perfect representation it reflected his slipping and its response. 
Newman unmasked unknown sides his real making sensitivity as a director. 
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian citizen Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, drew a subtle mrs effigy of full of melancholy. 
He that lost his son Scott through an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to this in 1984 a work of delicacy and sadness. 
During the flood of honors that poured yesterday over Newman his narrow friend and former arm companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely taken: ` his presence improved my life and this country. ' 
Generosity and high spirits were essential qualities of the late actor. 
Foreseen from his legendary career also a tall advocate of the civil rights, the environmental control and the independent movie theater, enters now opponent of the leeway Hollywoods, there. 
We held it presumably often with the foot in bowls full vinaigrette, in Saucen, pastry or other foodstuffs stand see, and this for quite tasteless in spite of our finding it merry at the beginning still. 
Nevertheless The profits from its turnover flowed into his foundation for children in need. 
Instead of taking a rest on his myth, Newman committed itself to the shots were fired. 
It left a letter with these words to his five daughters: ` always and to completely to at the end your father was incredibly thankful for his good start. 
It was an honour to be allowed to be here. 
And for us it was an honour to be allowed to pursue the life of a so intelligent and generous American actor. 
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the broadest sense. 
What became produces into the accounting factory of acceptance of a bid & amp; 
Co.? On 8th October surcharge and his accomplices begin the negotiations in criminal proceedings against jános. 
In particular the participation in the organized criminality is reproached the defendants, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - among other things document forgery. 
According to public prosecutor's office the means lukrierten from the bidding were used for their own purposes while the produced services were often being reserved with forged bills. 
State money and grants from the self-government - in total HOOF 65 million - should in part into the cash boxes of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, to have flowed in part into the private funds individual. 
As the investigation announced fictitious invoices were presented while referring the announcement money, and the clubs are not supposed to have fulfilled its obligations either. 
According to indictment a large part of the bills is supposed to have been forged. 
The accounting blocks were bought at on the market by Józsefváros, one made the to change the seals in Kiskunhalas be made. 
The decision on onto what companies the bills are supposed to be exhibited was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton onto which István Lados was sent to contract by János. 
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should make pensions and restaurants ausfindig. 
It demanded bills over the Konsumationen, around later on these proposals being based bills for the youth and sport department the social and employment, as well as to be able to exhibit the autonomy of Budapest. 
These bills are supposed to have been manipulated mainly of István Lados and his accomplices András ri at what latter according to our information for the Constitution of the relevant reports responsible is supposed to have been. 
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" were a beer bar. 
how it is to understand two of acceptance of a bid and Co in 2003 from exhibited bills, if the catering company is supposed to have served the neunzigköpfige group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now the head of the business declares, however, a such large group would not have fit at the same time into the local. 
Another bill, exhibited in the summer 2002 onto the donation Jobb Joevért, later known than Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért, showed also serious form and contents mistakes. 
In a retirement in Badacsonytomaj which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people simultaneously 130 guests are supposed to have stayed according to bill. 
The fantasy of the accounting counterfeiters apparently in the same way no boundaries were set, than it around the Pigal Kft. went, a gastronomy company, in whose accountancy documents of the customers Jobb Joevért and Hoppá not to appear according to Public Prosecution Service at all first. 
As Geschäftsführer informed Gyz Farkas of the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was a question of forged documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor's office during a consultation. 
"we company name and was the tax number wrongly on the stamp angebracht". 
And wider: Apart from irregularities also the fact that the operation is supposed to have accommodated a hundred people was wrong after they have in total eleven rooms which offer so many people place impossibly. 
Also Meals was mentioned on the bill, more is not the restaurant in operation in this case since some time. 
The busy accounting counterfeiters checked also verabsäumt, that the Budapester travel agency taken into the visor by them excluding travel abroad offers, and so they gave hungarian trips what of the accounting practices of the company also contradicted on the cash payment bill. 
how in the course of the investigation became known, they in addition mentioned also the VAT on the bills, although travel agency services that refer to a country outside of the EU are value added tax free. 
The level of VAT was in total on four of the hotel Révfueloep Kft. bills exhibited onto the donation Jobb Joevért wrong, there the company instead of 25 only 15 per cent VAT. settles, in addition mechanical bills are exhibited by the staff exclusively, the forged documents were, however, hand - written. 
Another error, that was this "Rechnungslegern" unterlaufen, that one was, that they had indicated in one Fall "shipment" as produced service although this is not offered by the company specialized on investment consultation the prosecutor informed. 
Further irregularities - wrong bill format, wrong die - were to be owed to, that at Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont exhibited bills as counterfeiting could be unmasked. 
In the same way in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sport camp Kunfehértó, which managers declared to never have exhibited the bills. 
Another "mistake" is to the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. circumvented from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just indeed in solution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is supposed to have eaten there - consequently the mass manager declared not to have exhibited the bills himself. 
Consciously forged 
The other group of the Rechnungsleger are persons who were absolutely conscious that they would have to lay fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the donation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért donation, in a level of about HOOF 4 million. exhibited. 
According to indictment the business manager became the Collab Kft. persuaded to the exhibition the fictitious invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyoerfi. 
The currently also in liquidation contained Biogate Kft. should also with acceptance of a bid and company. having cooperated: in 2003 should the GmbH the donation Jobb Joevért Alapítvány, as well as the associations of Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny Egyesület with forged bills in the total value of HOOF of 5 million. have supplied, that referred to not produced services. 
There were, however, just as little money transfers since the bills were canceled immediately to their exhibition, which the concerned persons forgot in your documents, however, to note down. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger contains persons who are brought immediately with the defendants associated. 
Iván Kubatov is to one of them, the mailman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, there, however, not discoverable fuel and vehicle market company. 
This company should in the period of October until December 2005 several bills about the sale of EDV components in the total value of HOOF of approximately 18 million. have exhibited. 
According to investigative body should the Cash Investment Kft contained since the 14th September 2005 in liquidation. having acted as a customer of these accounts from Kiskunhalas. 
Manager of that company was a Romanian to whom the company documents should be delivered also by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov stood during the investigation, bills on behalf of the GmbH. onto the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to have issued at Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent itself. 
The Skilled Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos - investment Bt. are supposed to have been based by Romanian Bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs explicit wish there. 
In truth, however, none of these companies was acting, which was due according to accused to lack of contracts. 
Nevertheless he could profit by the company: At the request of his accomplice, the attorney Zsolt Szente that was charged the preparation of the company foundation documents he issued on behalf of the Skilled bills onto the associations brought with contract in, as about at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
In total should Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HOOF of 14,2 Mio. on behalf of the firms Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, to have exhibited Jos investment and Linaxtrade onto the organisations. 
The prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have collected each 10% of the financial sum as well as the VAT. 
Kubatov should even the company Szi-Beri Bt. to have misused for the exhibition imaginary bills - in this case the accounts were enclosed with the applications by Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szoevetség a Rot Magyarországért to have in January 2006 their applications with the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") given. 
Both ever received 500.000 forints, these amounts however, were useful, however, zweckentfremdet. 
In order to hush this up, they have the TMA five ostensible bills of the Works Team Kft. 
presented. These bills were guaranteed after all by Árpád Kemecsei during the raid on the offices in the instruction department. 
At the negotiations a confession is reckoned now by some defendants about the procedure of the counterfeit banknotes as they were already before the public prosecutor's office put aside. 
A sensation could be, if the main defendants János contract to a full confession decides. 
His previous data were less indeed detailed, and although he had promised already repeatedly to tell comprehensively above all, still stands his confession. 
The question whether this lies in its interests remains therefore open the socialists a pact with it concerning the reparation of the majority of the arisen damage of HOOF of 50 million. have closed, and whether it is ready to Zuschlag to take over the responsibility in return. 
It is, however, absolutely possible, that acceptance of a bid now this "Beleidigten" play, after his requests had bumped on ease the imprisonment and house arrest on fallen on deaf ears. 
during other criminals that caused far greater damage with economic crime and did not compensate far greater damage, on free foot, or to stand at least under house arrest, remains to surcharge this possibility refuses. 
The psychology of the outdoing - or why we are ready to pay more 
In the case of auctions the customers tend to issuing more and überbewerten the Feilgebotene thus. 
Neurologists and economic researchers of the university of New York succeeded now in discovering the neurologic - economic basics of this familiar and seemingly irrational behaviour. 
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people do not want to give themselves beatenly in a competition, as such an auction on, and are therefore ready to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers attempted to find out the neurologic scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers should play National while the other one was participating in on action - in both cases the acting brain regions of the probands were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With two play the participants could extract money, however, an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain rind, with losers of the auction in the case of which the outdoing of the rival plays an important role was measured. 
Next to many other functions this brain region is for this "selfreward" of the nervous system responsible. 
The researchers thought therefore the price could be explained through the avoidance of a Überreaktion of the Striatums. 
In order to support their thesis, the economists did investigations to follow the money in the research group besides. 
In This Case three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions. 
The inspection was informed of the true value of the product, after that they did their operations. 
15 dollar reward were in addition promised to another group, for the case, that they emerge as winners out of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars in front of the auction which were also lost in the case of a lost game. 
The difference between two groups consisted therefore only in that, that the accentuation at one on the winning lay, during at the other one on the losing. 
Expressed by neurologists as an evidence for those ones hypothesis however the members of the group playing "against the losing" to higher operations were ready, as those in the Control - and/or. the "profit" group. 
"These results can not be derived from any previous economic theory. 
These justified indeed up to now the behavior observed in the case of auctions only with the joy about the winning, and/or risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was solved thanks to the picture - giving neurologic procedures, so that we now have a third statement ready credit "- Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic unit of the University of New York, meant. 
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to be consulted? 
Worldwide around a half billion people suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading death causes. 
The number of the infected ones is estimated in these parts at a hundred thousand, however, only seven thousand are treated, what at that it is due to their being infected that the patients do often not know. 
Hepatitis is the set for liver disease caused through different viruses, infectious. 
The symptoms are often similar - bowel liver and jaundice are frequent, however, the pathogens and the diseases distinguish from each other. 
According to virus the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: with hepatitis A and E through the digestion row (for example through contaminated food or water), with hepatitis B, C and D the viruses through blood and other body liquids can will transfer (as about sperm or, secretion juncture or spittle). 
An inoculation is recommended to travellers anyway against the viruses A and B, against the virus C there is not no vaccine. 
The symptoms with hepatitis A are proved for instance two - three weeks according to consumption of back contaminated food and are accompanied in general from uneasy opinion, weakness, stomach and nausea. 
After that the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can two - for three weeks last. 
Worldwide approximately 1 million dies. people at the illnesses caused from hepatitis B, far more difficult as cancer of the liver and hepatic cirrhosis. 
Main reason for that is that according to it is estimated only every tenth infected is in medikamentöser processing. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: in an untreated way it can lead to hepatic cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. 
Most infected do not know answer even about their illness since the pathogen destroys the liver insidiously - in many cases the first symptoms are proved after 20-30 years. 
Therefore punctual bending forward, as such regular inspections, is vital. 
There are three groups in which the disease occurs more frequently: those who subjected themselves to a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed ones. 
Currently the number of the ones Sick at chronic hepatitis C becomes worldwide on 200 million. estimated. 
Since the disease is already provable at a routine laboratory research, it is advisable to consult the family doctor with the first signs of unknown origin. 
In time recognized The disease is curable, the virus by which the chance of infection is averted and the development prevented from cancer can be eradicated. 
The 30 September is the world day of hepatitis, in 2004 for the first time worldwide organized by patient representations. 
It is aim of the action to strengthen the consciousness for this chronic bowel liver caused by viruses, their creation and the importance of early detection. 
Do believers have less pain? 
To occupy as latest research, that the religious believe as a kind "analgesic" work, that of Catholic martyrs is supposed to have facilitated already the death. 
Scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, the British one announced to what extent the believe in God influences the pain view of the people leaf "telegraph". 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation ever 12 Believers and atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the Mother God. 
As the results showed the believers could eliminate most of the pain. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan Technologie it could even be proved that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was the first in an research project which next to scientists also philosophers and theologians of different sections of the University participate in. 
During the experiment a sparkling device that gave the electric shocks was tied the probands to the left hand. 
The participants were asked for concentrating on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo there Vincis "ladies with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped, that the sight would cause the virgin Mary among the believers a kind of religious trance, while they were selecting picture to Vincis there, because it was hardly distinguished from the same as the other paintings and because it was felt as calming. 
The trials spent ever half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this time a total 20 electric shocks in four stages while they were should notice either the religious one, or the other paintings. 
The Catholics told, they would have themselves with at the sight of the Mother God "out of danger" felt, as if sie "worried" wae ren, and they hätten "rest and peace" felt. 
During the considering of the religious painting they reported about 12% less pain, than if they had Leonardos factory before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with pictures other, working strongly also with the atheists, one would have to find the photograph bare. 
"We would have to find a picture which activates very positive feelings as such a mother or a father", according to the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"this Practise of faith our personality should change, and it does also in many felling", so Wright. 
According to these excellent results only still the question what effect a Madonna - picture of Leonardos or another comparable painter onto the pain regulation of believers would have remains. 
would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results? 
You are, what you inform about you 
On the occasion of its tenth birthday Google to fair can claim: it is to be found in the pockets of the people just the same, as above their minds in the sky: She knows where the people transferred their holiday, to what doctors they go, and what moves it. 
And in this way always not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the business manager of Google. 
In the direction of sceptics who are troubled by Orwellschen it presents many he makes be adjusted: These would understand the essential thing of the Web 2.0 just. 
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt thought it is the main objective of Google to gather still more personal data about the users and to come so to the original purpose nearer to the company recently after what sie "all information of this world ordering" wolle. 
Schmidt declared, Google is after ten years of world - changing work still only at the beginning of the information - compiling. 
Asked for the Status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wanted Google would be in the situation "questions as" Which I "am supposed" to do "tomorrow"? or "which job" suits me in fact "? answer, however software programmes are not yet since they would not know enough about the users in the situation for this purpose. 
Not all internet users realize that in the course of their internet search the search keys would be registered as well as also the internet protocol addresses from which searched, and the gone pages. 
For example the one two years ago introduce "Personalized Search" allow the visitors his own search process store and to fall back to that later so that the right can be generated later much more precisely and also those ones are based on the same logic so genannten "Recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services due to of the previous preferences. 
The users wonder, however, what happens in the case of a data abuse - "when one checks what I do" - some show themselves worriedly the Google data monopoly's. 
In most cases it is, however, rather the power represented by the company, potential, the fear exciting works, and less the fault feeling or the fear of penalization, the quest for freedom or the rebelling against the power, that bumps onto rejected with many internet users. 
It is, however, a proven fact that the search keys are not only stored, but they are passed on also to third parties in the reason case, and in these cases of law there is not no protection for the personal rights of the internet - user. 
A perfect example for that was recently the action taken against Pädophilie in Brazil, in the course of which Google the Brazilian government presented information which were gathered from the community site by the name of "Orkut" and made also a identification for the Pädophilien possible. 
Users, worried about personal rights, could revive, however, still in May, when Google pulled together with the massive datamining experiment EFF successfully against the FBI before to court: accordingly Google also in future with no point of the constitution can be forced to handing over information to the FBI onto secret question. 
(However the federal government obtained successfully the delivery of 50.000 website addresses and 1.000 search keys under reference to the protection of minors law passed before years ago, however, the list of individual users, and/or their weaving and search key list onto two months was withheld from her retroactively.) 
Googles image remains therefore controversial: Those who hand over their personal data reluctantly because they fear the loss their private and right to privacy through the use of the Google - services castigate the enterprise with the indignation being deserved by the companies representing themselves conservatively. 
Meanwhile sees the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and inspired computer fans, activists and users eint, the next generation this "cool entrepreneur" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows Marktführer even if both fight for the same goal. 
A possible reason for that is that Google does not demand any identification codes from his users unlike Microsoft, and provides its services freely so that an open, continuously updated source code and Programm-Package to seem to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler, as the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand to look through the Geeks the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship, that in particular in the last years thanks to that Begriff "Web 2. 0" in the heart has moved. 
at the "Web 2. 0" gone it indeed around nothing other, than around collaboration, speak, the user leave behind traces on purpose and use available channels of communication the, and even if proportions the are individually different, main thing remains the same one, to show oneself in public indeed. 
An average of young people can manage be profile simultaneous on several community portals - of Facebook above Xanga, can these by means of other services, as about Twitter, or music services as last.fm can join with each other, and finally FriendFeed or Blip.fm bind this into a Nachverfolgungssystem all as about. In addition they can lead Blogs which represent the newest photographic galleries to be on Flickr or Picasa geostet automatically. 
And a number other exemplary cases proves: While considering the party photographs of last night the girlfriend finds out soon with whom their unfaithful friend enjoyed himself, or the staff is released because it does air to his on the management only far too honestly in his Blog - one is secure: The Begriff "privacy" became in the meantime entirely again interpreted. 
Who leads an online life is what it gives away from itself - so in for instance one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
And who attempts to keep something a secret, or to avoid quite the Google monopoly, can do that with pleasure - as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses the search engine Google, however, on purpose any traces does not leave behind. 
Not a very few people do not register on purpose also the applications for online of Google on community pages so that they are not discoverable, however, as about Text Processing - and graphic Tools and RSS-Feeds, make deal with alternative versions that are not tied to any gigantic server parks and therefore either do not generate the best possible profile from the user. 
Meanwhile Public opinion waits for that excommunicatedly until Google shows its true face. 
With its current value of $156 there is even the company for Mrd. IBM (USD 140 Mrd.), Intel (USD 124 Mrd.) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 Mrd.), the advertising spaces of AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of the advertisers, and that increasingly faster introduced services prepare is not only Microsoft, but also other software developers head fragmentation. 
Critical observer might find, however, also the worrying counterpoles: So the directors entirely rejected about a protest of the staff after the charges the company ’ s kindergarten were doubled, in addition the management thought the frequent meals of the staff is too expensive. That all seems, however, almost mildly against Google going even into the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and being agreed on an agreement according to which all regime - crucial hits, or those which offend against the good taste would be extracted. 
The internal settlement of the group says, that in advance no new service is applied, but only if this is already available. Nevertheless the events of the next few months and years could turn up again some strongly: While some are meaning, Googles Book - and to Magazinscan- and/or filing project accepts in the meantime scales, that the company would have to deal soon with the Uppermost Court of Justice, other are rather like this because of the Systems "Health" beunruhigt, that facilitates the preparation of a complete health section by means of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google establishes a genetic data base provides the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors with have the substance - approximately "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellschen manner a future, in which a human being thanks to data gotten by Google becomes frightening near - bar. 
Two young people help the double murder from Ózd during the trace elimination 
In Connection with the double murder of Ózd the police interrogated now two young people that stand in the suspicion, to have helped with the removal of the lanes, the speaker of the police commissioner's office Borsod divided on Tuesday. 
The young people were geständig, currently they are accused of aid. 
According to information of the news agency MTI it is a question of two girls who defend themselves on free foot. 
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years. 
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23 - year old local man, was taken on Sunday into remanded custody. 
The man stands under urgent action suspicion, to have murdered several people deliberately from exploit. 
In the course of the investigation it turned out that the 23 - year long one had owed a 53 - year long one a larger amount. 
Therefore, the suspect did not want to settle his debt, however, it lured his creditors onto a site on the last Wednesday in Ózd, where he murdered it and his nine years of foreign daughter. 
According to information of the MTI the man planned the action from a long - this proves also the fact that he committed the murders with an arm hidden at the scene of the crime. 
Together with experts the police examine now the explosive device as well as the circumstances their use. 
Warsaw Stock Exchange puts bid for Prague stock exchange 
Around 200 million. the Warsaw Stock Exchange offered euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns for the one hundred percent purchase of the blocks of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer which the Poland had put in spite of the fact that they were excluded formerly by the Czechs as possible owners their stock exchange. 
Reason for that is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange entirely belongs to the state. 
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state that wants to dispose of, however, more than 60% of the papers in the coming months. 
According to announcements of the Czech ones daily paper "E15" contain The today of Poland the up to now highest purchase price to ever be offered for the Prague Stock Exchange. 
As the newspaper announces, the Vienna stock exchange the Nasdaq transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German stock exchange put offers until now. 
Petr Koblic, leader of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week, that from all the stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be probably the worst new owners and it did not exclude either that could lead even to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in future. 
Market specialists estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns. 
According to agreement of the shareholders 90% of the shares could be sold. 
Most owners of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investmentbank with one 25 prozentigen participation, followed from the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14,7 and the Tigers holding Four S.a.r.l. 
with 13,5 percent. The financial crisis from the point of view European newspapers 
In their comments dedicated to the international financial crisis worsening always further spoke on Tuesday some leading European leaves already of the "second 11th September". 
We have to owe the American president the global finance disaster, "La Repubblica" thought for instance - the president was not even in the situation, his own party for the draft behind themselves too one that should bring something into the frightening situation relief... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion - heavy investor Warren Buffett named it, it would be more made, to speak of one "second 11th September". 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate the scapegoat also in Washington. 
in the view of the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership guilty at the global economy being now on the fringe of collapse. 
The American financial system tends to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from that. 
Bush's plan was not indeed perfect, now the danger threatens, however, after the vote in Congress, that Washington has no political means to the crisis management ready. 
The world economy hangs in the air, and just at a time since one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism occurs. 
One can not ignore the threat anymore, the Genfer "day - indicator" thinks for instance. 
Still Although some states could provide rescue packages for their banks guessed into the rocking, and save the banks with the money 'taxpayers from the bankruptcy. 
, however, a domino effect is activated and even more banks go in a broke way, neither then further injections or other emergency measures, do not help. 
On a long-term basis the EU member states would have to jump about their shadow and to centralize control of the money markets. 
Only on Monday more became than paid out EUR 100 to faltering financial institutions, reminds the Wiener "this standard". In addition, so the newspaper wider, the objections that after the Americans also the European taxpayers would have to grasp their pockets a little more deeply now in order to come out from the crisis are increasingly more realistic. 
Up to now the EU did not deal seriously with the crisis, that now how one tsunami on the old continents sweeps. 
The "rescuers" would not have "to wave" indeed several hundreds of billion euros immediately, it would be, however, advisable to observe in which case it would be sensible to touch the money 'taxpayers in order to avert an even greater damage being done. 
Intelligent car copies the flight of the Hummel 
what the best method for the evolution of new technologies for the accident avoidance would be, when not to copy the obstacle sensors from the nature? 
For example the one of the bees. 
At the CEATEC in Japan a startling project was presented, at which the Nissan engineers of bumblebees during the creation were inspired new accident of avoiding systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University Nissan built the biomimetic system of the model BR23C controlled by car robots, a mini-car, endowed with the qualities of bees with the aim, to support the evolution of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In in flight Each bee forms their own, oval "private field", that our own "shield" very similar is, Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology PR and investigation evolution, during the exhibition said. 
The eye of the Bee put together that can see into any direction and in a corner from more than 300 degrees plays in this case an important role. 
In order to imitate the function of the eye put together the researchers picked up the idea of the optical maser - controlled telemeter. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of sight of 180 degrees within two metres, calculates their long distances and sends signals onto the microprocessor at board that immediately initiates the collision - avoiding process. 
The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the robot car changes immediately the course, similar to the movement of the bees, when he turns the tyres around the relevant corner. 
Unlike previous systems this ploy occurs in that instinctively. 
"If it was not like this, can the robot car not fast enough" Toshiyuki Andoh, conductor of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the selfrobot project, declared "to react in order to evade the obstacles". 
The system must react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the protecting US from recession - a shift, to currently still be regarded as unavoidable within the accidents. 
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must end in a split second. 
However, the evasiveness can not occur, unlike the bees, up, down, or at all diagonally - it can be only two - dimensional, and indeed only in the direction the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
To stand during the bees here infinitely many possibilities openly in order to avoid other bees could help the researchers at the robot car of only the rotary motion, and/or the speeding up and slowing-down's. 
The BR23C contains polymer lithium batteries which are lighter and more vigor - efficient, and therefore have a longer life, as traditional lithium ion batteries. 
Andoh declared it depends on that the instinctive intelligent response and little onto the processing of the data, and still less onto the ability to store these. 
This device must process only a few inputs per second and react to them correspondingly. 
It does not have to store these, or must produce by means of previous manoeuvres so that it uses constantly only a handful KB Memory. 
It gigabyte and megabyte - heavy Memories does not need any. 
This is the first step in the evolution of the immediate conflict prevention technology which will be serial according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years in production. 
A further application could find the technology during the GPS satellite navigation, when it directs the motorist conscious around barriers around and leads it so onto the target. 
A name for the sündteure child 
Now there is the written version of the 700 - Mrd - dollar of difficult rescue package law which will be to be used in several stages and is aimed at the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round half the money is supposed to be distributed. 
In a session, that on Saturday after midnight local time east coast zu Ende ging, struggled themselves the congress representatives after more - daily debates for an agreement about that 700 - billion dollar heavy rescue parcel, reported Reuters. 
"we significant progress have achieve", Nancy Pelosi, democratic president said in the American Chamber of Deputies, and meant one must only still bring the agreement to paper. 
both presidential candidates supported the achieved compromise about the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought to the result: the programme will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do, however, still more. According to Pelosi of Wall Street would not go it here around the rescue, but around pulling the helm of the economy. 
The written composure of the package still became before the of the Asian markets, therefore, Washington time on on sunday night 8 at (Central European time Monday 2 a.m. in the morning), publishes, did not activate, however, any flight of fancy on the stock markets. 
On Monday the House of Representatives votes first on the draft for the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is at the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke at the saturday night with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news on the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and value the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House, said. 
the programme differs, however, from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at the same time for the purchase of bonds rotten, burdened with loans. 
In a first tranche maximally half of the 700 - billion - amount with which 250 billion are immediately available is supposed to be distributed after as expected the congress will vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit - loaded, bad bonds, and the president is supposed to decide on the further 100 billion USD. 
The programme is checked by an own commission to which also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. 
The other half of the 700 depends on a further decision of the Congress. 
In the sense of the law the Treasury can use also a combined tactics: Can buy same time bad loans, mortgages, and bonds burdened with mortgages, or also other "poisonous" credits. 
Told as competent persons of the ministry the purchase can both in an auction, than also directly occur. 
The law makes to participate in an insurance programme with which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies pay the Exchequer charges corresponding to the damages to be expected for the affected companies possible. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so, that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk which is activated by the collapse of a bigger bank. 
We set Paulson the necessary steps so that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. 
The chiefs of the banks in trouble guessed and now dependent onto government aid can reckon, however, that their dispatches which are mentioned "Golden Handshake" in the overseas - slang salopp are shortened by the government. 
There will be A cut of salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. 
The reduction in means basically, that if the department buys within the framework of an auction, so this "Golden Handshake" besteuert becomes, unless, that serve bank leader is removed into the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchasing the bad loans the government will join in aggressively in order to guarantee that the directors ’ pay are not exaggerated. 
To the picture appertains also, that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge are changed not - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, in this way all the more people participate in the programme. 
That is the first case in American history, the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the Financial Committee the measure, commented on cuts being controlled with manager - salaries by law. 
The state gains participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they can also be involved as soon as it the economy and in this way also the saved bank again better goes. 
The draft law plans that the president must make a proposition how the taxpayers' are supposed to get back their lost money from the financial sector again to the congress in the next five years. 
There were, however, sceptics who expressed their doubts with respect to the plan on both sides. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of the taxpayers under any circumstances, according to the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were driven forward by the same people, that also for the collapse of the Wall Street are responsible.

Review of German-speaking area 
The rights camp is intact, only the electorate became within the camp more selfconscious - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to the to rule in order to prevent a red - black coalition. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the online edition of the to the left of settled German information warehouse Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's revolution vertilgt their fathers". 
In the view of the renowned Politologen the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo began the erosion of the CSU already long before his offices took over. 
The Christian - social ones renewed Bavarians over decades - now the modern citizens just turn away from them. 
The era break is simultaneously a problem of the Christian, as also for Angela Merkel. 
Very surprisingly that did not come disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday something zu Ende gegangen, what already before quite exact 10 years drew: Certain hegemony a ruling party 
Because already ten years ago 1998 ago, 1998 the CSU lands at 47,7 percent and fell in this way for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty percent - brand 
That was repeated three years ago at the election of the Bundestag in 2005, therefore still in the a lot quoted Stoiber era. 
The modernization in In the province consistently practiced by the CSU vertilgt in the end their own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had already 40 years ago predicted that, in this case but in the speed considerably verschätzt. However without effects the secularization could stay, the formation successes, the rush of east and north Germans into the prosperierenden areas of Bavaria onto the faith of the CSU voters not. 
Modernisation is accompanied always by option increase. And that has political consequences. 
The rights camp is intact - only the voters in the camp became more crucial and more self-willed. 
Striking is, that in the last few weeks almost the traditional community groups expressed the largest detachment from the CSU: the free professions, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with levels as university degree. 
Here the support of the CSU sank onto all under 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper tells in theirs "Who with whom? Article entitled party leaders reservedly in coalition questions" about the chaotic inside - political situation in after the elections. 
The SPOE would like to negotiate with the OEVP. 
The OEVP forbids itself the interference of into internal affairs. 
The BZOE shows himself openly to conversations into all directions while the greens are not wanting to define themselves with respect to a coalition yet. 
The new elections are past, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates in the public television the party leaders hardly made look into their hands. 
SPOE chief Werner Faymann confirmed its desire, to want to negotiate with the OEVP. 
The SPOE wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is very presumably possible - in some states and in the partnership this is already the case. 
Faymann left open the question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer the current as a vice-chancellor. 
As he said the voters would have given up the bowl - Molterer - course. 
A repetition of this direction would not come into consideration. 
Meanwhile Molterer reacted to red offers cautiously. 
The cooperation can not be fertile, it thought if Faymann attempts to interfere to the OEVP in internal concerns. 
Whether his party goes in opposition, or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed OEVP - intern. 
Jörg Haider showed himself openly into all directions. 
"In order to prevent red - blackly, we are ready to take over and grew", according to Haider. 
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and the segregation must be broken 
Today the European summit on equal opportunities began in Paris, that is orientated heuer of the France EU council premiership country. 
In their speech directed onto the house Lívia Járóka, Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, made attentive in particular onto the formation segregation, there these one of the most serious violations is, that happens to Roma children, in addition is this the greatest obstacle to those one craving for recognition. 
The high-level conference was started by the French occupation and social minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU - commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among the participants representatives of governments the European partners, were as well as the most important European legal protection and citizen organizations from the field equal opportunities. 
how the press office of the MEPs from the human announces, járóka pointed made attentive on that, that next to discrimination during the job search that Roma in the first place would be replaced from the labour market because of their low levels of education. 
"the predominant majority of the Roma young people does not have any central school formation, and thanks to a poor primary education only a small part of them can reach graduating from university". 
Moreover Járóka stressed that education is some basic human rights which a key role would be attributed to during the assertion of other human rights. 
The economy of the EU member states can strengthen investments in the early training of Roma children. 
In the view of the members it is important, that this links a ring as broad as possible - therefore Roma and non-Roma - conscious becomes. 
Because each formerly a Roma pupils the school begins, the stronger his chances to become productive member of the labour market increase; and through income tax and VAT they achieve their contribution to the national expenditure. 
"as union citizens, the right to quality education must be safeguarded to the Roma - the bad and segregierte instruction must prepared became" - so Lívia Járóka. 
As the members declared, a common, destination and action - based procedure of the European Union is necessary in order to accelerate the Desegregationsprozess on the formation sector. For this purpose the correct compliance of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is vital. 
"We must break through the vicious circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and Roma children the Democratic opportunities to give to contribute to on the future Europe as full entitled citizens" Járóka required. 
Since the congress in Berlin last year the summit is organized annually with the aim, a unique forum for the Voranbringung of the destinations of equality and, freedom from discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the "European Year the equal opportunity" to create. 
CSU: 
Grace for a limited time At the end of October the fate of the fallen duet Huber-Beckstein is decided on 
In spite of the electoral collapse yet no heads roll in the meantime, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were adjourned. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and prime minister Beckstein still stay in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts. 
The fate of the tandem according to the catastrophic 17 - prozentigen loss of vote is decided on at the last weekend in october during at the special party conference. 
The duet called a lot made already look through, however, that it would not like to stick to their chairs. 
In this way they want to calm the annoyed parliamentary party and the party basis, that a day after this "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority personal consequences required. 
Five years ago - added, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached another 60,7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber they could safeguard only 43,4 percent of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 years long "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, which erwirtschaftet 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain indeed the determining strength in the also for the Hungarian economy important southern province, will have to rule, however, in the future in a coalition. 
As a first sign of the party - intern restructuring the potential successor Hubers is bound vice-president and Bundesagrarminister thicket Seehofer also into the research team that with the liberal FDP, and/or the rechtsgerichteten "Freien voter" Exploratory talk about a possible Munich coalition leads. 
It amounts to an irony of fate, that with that one list "Free voter" that Gabriele Pauli into the legislature enters, that the Huber-Beckstein Duo exploited Anti-Stoiber appearance first in order to rid oneself of the determined politician mercilessly then. 
The CSU - management concentrates now all its energies on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transitional process an active role will be attributed to Stoiber which up to now pulled the threads out of the light. The former prime minister and CSU chairperson mentioned 28 September the most "bitter day of his political". 
On on Monday Huber did a few poisonous remarks in the direction of CDU - according to his opinion the CSU would have earned more support far from the sister party. 
Other CSU - politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal onto the CDU and in this way also at Angela Merkel. 
if the CSU which contributed to the success a lot in 2005 also on national level should not be put on its feet with a common effort again, Merkel can not become chancellor again after the election of the Bundestag in September 2009. 
Merkel who did not do no secret from their disappointment at the fiasco believes that the losing ground of the CSU will not affect the grand coalition negatively in Berlin. 
What, however, is relative: The injured CSU will not be to be governed more easily, and meanwhile the crisis of the social democrats goes on. 
With 18,6 percent the SPD achieved her so far best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukaschenko - opposition: 
At the elections on Sunday not a member of the opposition got into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers think this is due to on prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD presumes, however, Gesetzwidrigkeiten with the counting of votes. 
The OECD which sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not acknowledge the elections. 
De Legislatur of the 10 - million inhabitant state manages indeed since decades without opposition. Nevertheless has the under the name "Vereinte democratic strengths" (ODS) gathered adverse party in front of the choices of yesterday serious expects, that this time Lukaschenko, who already renewed his presidential term at the unhealthy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 for the fourth time, unites members of the opposition in the parliament "approve" dignity. 
Therefore the ODS took distance even of the before planned boycotts. 
Ukraine becomes economically increasingly more dependent thanks to the increasing prices with the gas import of Russia. For the relief of the price increases even loans were taken up, and the country agreed also to the sale of the Beltransgas, the proprietor of the gas pipeline leading through the country, onto the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition the hope the Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other hochrangige politicians because of the political system classified as antidemocratic in the EU have travel ban stood therefore. 
The evaluation report of the elections of the OECD guaranteed for a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis lay rather on the positive movements, instead of on the shortcomings - as about the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidate of the elections. 
However, the rapid report of the OECD already on Monday criticized the campaign - accordingly might occur opposition ell not in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present with the counting of the vote. 
In spite of all that the opposition is a recovery in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were put for instance on released prisoners, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontation with Moscow when the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces keeps on refusing South Ossetia and Abkhazia it although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, considers the two areas as independent since a month. 
"we have done two steps forward and one backwards, however the most important thing is, that the dialog between Belarus and the EU begun have", Alexander Milinkevich said with regard to our story. 
In the view of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful ones fear have gotten, to let member of the opposition the parliament also only one. 
The opposition does not plan any protest measures faced with the results, but it attempts rather to explain the voters the need for economic reform. 
"We have to fight here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us stones during in distribution into the way, but nevertheless I see even the older ones that people support the change more and more -" Milinkewitsch said in allusion to that, that not even the meistunterstützte shift of the pensioners with the Lukashenko regime einverstanden is, whose only income is the manufacture social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade it is merely a matter of, to which" to crumble onto "social safety" reminding the silence of a cemetery "begins", according to Milinkewitsch. 
Unlike the opposition politician Russian observers referred to the elections as democratic. 
Sergej Lebedev, ladder of the mission of the Commonwealth Independent States declared ria Novosti to the news agency: "this people believe the action, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore an evidence for the maturity of the Belarus voters. 
Brunetta: "from now on becomes before the work gefrühstückt" 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the access of officials. 
From today the measure steps against those ones those Schlaumeier in operation, which first stamp and then during the working time Coffee - Drink go. 
The new "Anti-lazybones law" became introduced to secretary-general of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration and of Mauro Masi, today. 
">"Drehbare doors are a means for the increase of the work efficiency through a higher attendance rates and more services", according to minister Brunetta. 
"now a new era of accountability and transparency begins. 
This is reformism ", Brunetta underlines once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi the use ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers. 
Masi thinks to that: "this choice of the rotatable doors is also of large symbolic worth". 
On the part of the officials there was not any resistance the secretary-general assured: "this process was supported by all of them, the collaboration came from all pages". 
All in all there is not now therefore no breakfast during the hours more; End with godforsaken place or Croissant. 
Brunetta 's guesses concerning that with a smile: "one good Cappuccino at 7 a.m. works Wunder". 
During a meeting of the maximum committee of the public administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
from Rome the minister announces, that "within of three months the absences of officials to 50% have reduced, that is 60, 000 people per year more during the work present are". 
He adds it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy 
"this collective dynamic - so the minister - 10 years were twice as large in the last ones as the private sector was and far over the Inflation installment". 
Meanwhile thousands of officials put together, around the Brunetta decree within the framework of the appointment supported by Codacons work. 
"during the minister distinguished for public service with numbers about smaller Absenzen during the work - so the consumer headquarters writes - that the people increases this' taetigen Rotten pelze 'constant. 
In Fact thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service put together in order to explain the war to the illegal standards of the decree. " 
In particular additional financial compensation are fought for before the regional Administrative Court (TAR) for work-related illness; during which inspection visits the planned enlargement of the engaging under house arrest of the sick worker holder is also able to be done like this and during which inspection visits further aspects of the innovations of the minister can be contested. 
Napolitano: "prevention against accidents at work is decisive" 
Every day 2500 accidents at work happen in Italy, three people die and invalids have 27 life - oblongly. 
For the year 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm indeed that the fatal accidents at work were near approximately 1200. 
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes twice as many deaths almost twice than arise through murders. 
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will inspect the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw so the attention of the social institutions and media to this tragic situation. 
"this alarming, from Anmil data spread and the tragic news these days confirms how decisive the issue of Prevention is at in the workplace.", the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms Pietro Mercandelli in his communication onto the president of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro). 
The head of state expresses his "large esteem for the unchangeable engagement for the Prävention at the jobs, to the protection of the hurt workers, for the aid for the families of victims and for the sensitization of the public ones opinion". 
"one empörtes" enough "have risen on that; understandable with tragedies that activate some vertebra, measured by its size, in the media and sympathy the. But the reality confronts us frequently with dramatic events, that even to repeat oneself in their dynamics ability". 
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information." 
A special significance take the numerous initiatives for a more direct Bewusstwerdung in school framework on the part of the young people, that the world are nourishing, at. 
It is our duty to focus the attention on this phenomenon and to turn away not from his social seriously. One must put a legislative standard into force and correct a legislative norm. 
For his part the president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini showed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths" forms "an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of us all and forces all institutions to put an end to the problem in order to work for decisive rules that have the destination". 
"this data of the accidents to seem to signal a slight improvement, this does not exclude, however, that the number of work-related deaths much too high is", president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli, stresses. 
"we would like not, that this" positive tendencies "few intimated to attention. Exactly that causes at the end the tragedy. 
"how believe that one undertakes too little in Grunde in order to oppose the phenomenon of accidents do. One can fight through different actions against that. 
Stronger checks and inspections are in we think necessary - so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures for to increase awareness of the workers, that already in the school beginnen ". 
further effort is necessarily - so he in addition puts - something the communications and the awareness of public opinion starts. 
However, particularly a greater responsibility feeling is on the part of the employers opposite a phenomenon, which represents a social event, in demand ". 
"Mercandelli came on that" to speak "for the accident at work sacrifices" also onto "the increasing degradation of the protection and denounced" the "abolition of the social security system" which "we fight" against "in recent years". 
"It is not the destination consequently to return an assurance to the workers on insurance in this way the fate of the victim of a service onto voluntary or accidental donations that are decided on by a legislator from time to time, dependent becomes". 
MP3 players under indictment: Danger of hearing - damages 
Hearing loud music over a longer space of time with acceptable music devices, as such MP3 players, can lead to permanent impaired hearings. 
The European commission which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the current one and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report today spread into Brussels announces this. 
"from the report - so it is called in a comment - realizes, that 5-10% of those ones that weekly for at least five years longer hear than an hour on day of loud music with acceptable recording equipment the lasting loss of their hearing riskieren". 
"I do worries myself that a so great number of young people who put usually acceptable recording equipment and mobile phones on a high volume damage their voice heard without knowing it unwiederbringlich", according to Meglena Kuneva. 
"from the scientific discoveries - so it is called on the part of the EU - a clear risk that is urgent to fast action is proved. 
It is what in fact counts to sensitize the consumer and to turn this information into common good. 
We must check faced with this scientific evidence the already existing control systems again so that they are completely effective and "hold pace with the new technology". 
Brussels had charged the independent scientific committee faced with the spread use of the acceptable recording equipment among young people. 
"this scientist - so the communication from the EU closes - confirm that one is too quite worried and that the Eu Kommission will examine the necessary measures now together with the other Eu members and the affected around children and young people better before the noise, that from acceptable recording equipment and similar devices comes, to protect to ability". 
already a European standard exists at the moment, that the level of the noise of acceptable recording equipment restricts on 100 decibels. The concern about the damages which could come from a large excessive noise. 
One can delimit They damage very much, in which one grasps solutions as the reduction of reducing noise and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the EU refers, that, when the users of acceptable recording equipment only music says five hours a week (louder than 89 decibels) to hear so that the legal limits are already crossed that concerning the maximum noise levels in the job are valid. 
Those ones, to exceed the music this border risk, the complete loss of the hearing within five years. 
That would concern therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated at between 2,5 and 10 million persons in the Eu. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the starting pistol to the "commission for the future the capital" 
We begin today, in March it is supposed to be past, in June balance sheet is drawn.

In June - so the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan, in which we the work achieved by the commission be useful werden ". 
who questions the competence of the commission since their opinion lacks at binding Alemanno replies to that: "Everything hangs from the work, which will achieve the commission and of the quality of their propositions, from. 
if it supplies, according to as in France the Attali commission, quality - full results - and this will be certainly the case in Rome - then your contribution will be elementary. 
Too often the policy deals with the day-to-day problems and emergencies which from time to time occur. 
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in the look, all the more with serious in a deeper perspective onto the development Rome and the future of the city rework ". 
The Lord Mayor Rome puts on very important, to specify following "Neither this commission is not a useless still a wreck: it is completely clear of all charges, they costs the roman citizens a penny and she will bring us to reflect. She will" employ "the best minds of the capital". 
According to Alemanno "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is not either hermetical or static in order to make a high-quality jump - that in fact she has necessarily - for our city possible, and to do such a common step into the future". 
A future, so the chief burgomasters' of Rome that do not restrict themselves only in the current local borders but much wider will look ", not only with regard to the role of Rome as metropolis and political capital Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. 
Obama - the first president? Here a statement 
A known American politician to whom at that being regarded as independent suits a lot wrote: "Barack Obama the second anti-american one becomes president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that through its decisions, that decimated economy of the United States and that maintained relations with the befeindeten Islam (and does this still today as a private citizen) ". 
The attacks against Obama become increasingly more vehement, just now, where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is fully ambitions. 
Obama is very insolent: it thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation, that a total two black governors has seen and "five black senators"!. 
Actually these attacks do not have to say, however, much; it is a question of racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the opinion polls; they all say that Obama with a big lead will win. 
Also in this case people are there, that with that heart and not with the head speak. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in deepest south of the United States, wrote in theirs in the editorial: first in the voting booths we will know presumably to whom the genuine American patriot will give his voice. 
Here a mentality of the United States appears, that to last hidden was held. 
"It says what you want, then we will decide for whom we will do our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain". 
There are people that swear over there: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something that one did not hear never before - first now, where the success seems of the black candidate so secure. 
Onto all cases despite all these, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were consulted: What mistake did Bush commit during his tenure? 89% have answered: 
the war in Iraq. 
America changes. The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step to the behind again home. 
In Iraq 4 500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
In spite of that, Iraq remains of the weakness of Bush for the majority. 
That one which will take its place stands before a huge task. 
United States. The financial collapse leaves behind its mark also with journalists: In the newspapers one can sense said the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists were questioned about their situation and their mental control by the PEW Research center concerning the future. 
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic what their future starts. 
Nevertheless they did not declare responsible ones that one opposite worriedly concerning the information in fact because of the overall credibility. 
You do not feel as alone as formerly. 
The problem for the American journalist is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economical model which was destroyed. 
In addition the major problems come through the cuts affecting the Newsroom, therefore the room's in which the editors work in order to put together the newspaper. 
It is a question of a problem that must be solved - so the interviewed journalists - if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism as the large public understands it does not shrink considerably. 
A clear, but complicated pessimism gives today to the American journalist. 
Six of 10 journalists and Executive Seniors of the written press think, that the journalism is on national level on the wrong way. 
In the local area it is at the Executives even onto the 65%. 
Printed one vs. 
Broadcast. It is not difficult for the journalists to introduce oneself into the direction that Web goes. 
The most important publishing groups would clear the way into to the internet, that of many when this "killer" this written press is looked. 
this "economic Druck", which the journalists sense, climbed around up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to want to follow the new technology in which hope "sie something brings good for the journalism". 
The biggest rift consists in the American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of their editors-in-chief on national level are secure, their reporters share their values with them while it is being only 23% on local level. 
Some think, it has with this "safety in that one Arbeit" to do. 
To lose the works managers that are afraid their work within three years, been 47% on national tier. 
With the journalists it is 30%. 
The topic of the "secure work" in the team (our "editors", Anm. d. Talk.) is in the United States always a hot topic. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
To offer in a vast nation as it is the United States with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, broadcast and TV senders and internet operators the employers as they like it and a question of take it or leave it becomes like this it. 
the urge very often get very high wages, the editor on the other hand can get now and then only 10000 euros monthly, for this purpose pension and insurance money. 
What the holiday starts, so the thing is complicated: a certain amount on days in the first year, so and so a lot after the third, in order to reach 15 holiday days finally according to a number of years. 
But the American journalists become frequently "sick" as they themselves add in the course of the year. 
It is a question of climate. 
UNIPOLE ANTENNA: court in Rome: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second international criminal court of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided on refusing the application of the estate agent. This had asked for being moved to Rome by Grottaferrata. 
It becomes against Coppola because of red bank within the framework of the investigation about the Gegenvereinbarung in the case of the incorporation of Unipol-Bnl. 
investigate. In the course of the process against it during the last week, his dismissal from the house arrest was converted into a residence requirement in Grottaferrata. 
His attorneys Michele Gentiloni and Gätano Pecorella had asked for allowing the estate agent to be moved to a flat from the town in the capital. 
According to the court such kinds of this kind inclusion could give him (which ones the prosecutor had spoken out against) to influence its society and to reach onto it accusing evidence material the opportunity. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon as the chamber of deputies against which in 700 billion - dollar saving - parcel of the White House voted had already few days ago manifested itself: One large part of the Americans was and more is at that interested Wall Street to punish as the economy to save. 
This confirms the edition of the New York Times that reports about that, divided as the crisis in the run the republican party that divides itself up in their old and moderate East cobough soul more and more, of yesterday that always favored the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative, that "those in Washington" and the of world finance hostile faces and before a. in the South and the centre of the states electorate wins. 
This part of the party owes his rise before a. the voice of that, that I above-mentioned. 
Meanwhile this just mentioned example is only a small part of the great modifications which the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also in the whole West and maybe will be also beyond these concerned by these. 
Both in the states and in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events which accept take shape under these new conditions at last and come onto to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard Renaissance of the state, in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy. 
In Fact the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which close links to the outside have and at the same time an enormous amount of assets from private households that lives in a single state manage. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed as it is to behave opposite the affected families necessary, which yes also one enormous electoral measures represent. 
The crisis appears therefore economically global, political on the other hand it is almost in that national. 
The political internationalism seems so to have gotten into marginalised in and to have lost be allowed at itself: The obvious evidence for that was given by the EU, not to find which one due to their division in various national and international conflicts a common way white. 
Therefore calculate now all with the intervention of their own state; Rescue plans, new rules, and before a. distribution of aid fund: Since the crisis became increasingly more serious only the United States are in the economic situation to escape without foreign aid. 
And next to the resources they in addition have also the legitimacy these use: thus two conditions not too überwertende - under certain circumstances -, onto which ones else is not an international organisation and not a market in a similar way will be able to go back. 
That new emphasis which is put onto the public - national element is by the way in perfect unison with the increasingly greater importance which recently is brought in the economy with a sector allied onto the narrowest in touch: to The territoriality. 
Paradoxical way is to just have joined a cross-linked entire empire it now when we were nevertheless so convinced by that for a long time, into an empire of the always refined technologies, the immaterial one, that we must find out at the same time how nevertheless our future will depend on the things in an essential way physical more and more: 
Water, harvest and oil. These can be transported to the other one of the world certain indeed all of a place, nevertheless are awake, however, utmost united with a closely paraphrased piece of earth - a territory. 
Therefore that one that has a such territory is to another that lives in a field harvest - free, water - free or free from oil reserves opposite to advantage. 
I come now to the second innovation to presuppose, however a brief insertion. 
Who territory, who government, who says policy, says too leadership in this way. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand the knowledge is white to that one there around the necessity of Leaderships looked at, that is the demand for somebody, as one controls the things. 
On the Other Hand now a wave of the indignation about the existing leadership exists, before a. those of the economics that turned out as inadequately and fully blind sectors. 
Finally in addition a deep aspect sufficing and worrying in some ways still comes: A confidence loss, an Unduldsamkeit, a picture of the whilst, a feeling of the distance which is directed itself towards a whole class all from managers of the western countries. 
Seems to clear like this the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content the majority than always other and überkommener represent. 
The demand for Leadership nourishes in a therefore underground way a branched but powerful movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in sudden "Revolts" this voters and in the unprovided change of the collective state of mind of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour Party in Britain, there for the rebellion of the American members against George Bush (and maybe also the victory plays the rights in Italy here a role). 
One gains the impression as if the old elite has their parties their programmes, but also their Riten, journals, intellectual creditors, to some would become say to her format, more and more sense problems and therefore less representative value concerning what nowadays goes before itself in the lower social classes of the West and still amplifies from the financial crisis and is driven up to the Überdimensionalität. 
in the face of all of this would be it in a simple way exaggerated, of one "rebel ion the Massen" to speak. 
Holding the eyes far openly, however, is not meanwhile surely. 
The superadhesive which makes go up at walls 
To be able to climb up the strengths of the force of gravity thanks to an adhesive to conquer and walls as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centers from which one thing now apparently almost arrived at the goal. 
With an adhesive on an area qcm found only by 2,5 the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kilos bodies on a normal wall. 
The STUDIO - a US magazine has, the researcher of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published the results. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is a development of the already used adhesives, which a special carbon structure, mentioned Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"this principle of the adhesive can one as a line to a pile of spaghetti of ordered thermionic valves imagine", declaredly Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists made feet of the geckos be inspired of the, which ones of microscopic Härchen that give a perfect stop to the animal are overcast. 
The with different materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper of test carried out showed that the new adhesive is zehnmal stronger than the consider ability of the feet of reptiles and "remove from the wall" at the same time "without problems makes", according to Liming Dai, researcher of the department of engineering of the at University of Dayton. 
WANDERING AT WALLS? "These material could" be used "as deciduous sniffing", Liming Dai in addition puts. 
About around as to go Spiderman at walls? Maybe already, but the researchers rather think of one less fascinating benefit, as about the link electrical equipment, because conductors of heat and electricity are the nano small tubes in the same way. 
Other fields could fall into the area of space. 
For the moment the superheroes must wait therefore still. 
The other type of research - also the university of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself to a new adhesive kind. 
In an article in the American Chemical Syndrome Society the Californian scientists present an adhesive of microfibres the as hairs through movement on a surface even the dust clean and through that always a perfect liability preserve. 
drugs: never charm with fruit juice 
Caution in front of grapefruit, orange and apple juices. 
These drinks, that due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin fortune in front of a. to be consumed in the summer, serious health risks can cause if they are charmed at the same time as certain vital medicines since they can affect the photo of these through the body in an extreme way. 
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, refers repeatedly to the risk more packedly as well fresh fruit juices in conjunction with fuelled. Within the framework of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Syndrome Society in Philadelphia he beat once again alarm: A glass apple, orange or grapefruit juice suffices in order to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines so far that these are virtually eliminated and the health of patients is endangered so. 
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart circuit medicines, anxiolytischer and neurologic means, up to toxic levels. 
MEDICINES IN DANGER - the Same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report against two years ago before the dangers of this Mixes, and it accentuates something to Diazepan to pay attention to that in connection with resources such as or is drunk Metadon. 
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts also juice and apple juice contain substances that can check the medicines. 
The list of the active substances checked from the fruit juices is long. 
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are passed on usually immediately to the different international manufacturers who so are free to change the consumer information. 
Therefore it is recommended, always to read the package insert and not to have not afraid when problems still exist to ask to a pharmacist or to doctor ", the expert of the Ansa agency stresses. 
Wirtschaftsnobelpreis goes onto Paul Krugman 
The economics nobel prize is onto the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of a pattern of trade and the location economic activity. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, which teaches at the university of Princeton and known to his regular article for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the tallest critics of the economy and exterior politics of the Bush administration. 
Few months after the assaults of the 11th September 2001, during the days of the Enron - breakdown, Krugman had said in an editorial in The New York Times this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassination attempts. 
A prediction that did not receive controversy as an answer little and the economist was even reproached for it years later, it proves completely correct to be, however, today. 
"I am surprised and also shocked about that, disappeared as quickly the memory onto the scandals within the framework of the breakdown from Enron or Worldcom from the public field of vision are", declared Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is an "economist of big value", nevertheless also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style that turns especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration." 
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" - package 
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 came; the Open source software wins as substitute clear of all charges for Microsoft's Office an ever greater number of there, both at home than also in the office, both among freelance and in the public administration. 
After a year of intense work through the voluntary developers that is controlled by Sun Microsystems the new Open Office presents himself to the public now with some innovations: next to a reworked and now more spartanischer initial menu formed, an entirely guaranteed compatibility with Apples is now at last operating system ‘ McJobs ’ OS X reaches, as well as given to 1.2 the relief for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format, that is the newest Standard-ISO version. 
Eighth against became further onto the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007 that new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice. 
Also some new features, about that one that is allowed to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations are interesting, what, for example the ability to send via email facilitated. Also the PDF possibility belongs to that to import files into diagram processing modules and to preserve the initial appearance of the page at the same time. 
So let themselves now also "hybrid" PDF file generate, that broaden the typical diagram of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system. 
The cooperation is one of the most strongly improved elements of the applications: Tables through which conflicts are avoided in the case of changes can be adapted now mehrhändig by different users; in the case of the word processing system's every person responsible of a Frabe is assigned in order to guarantee one like that better correction procedure. 
Some companies are just at publishing different functions of OpenOffice in the Internet (on the cloud) while in the coming weeks the definitive result is being supposed to be made public. 
The Italian version gets up following left to the download availably: http: / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. Thus it follows the English version which is since Friday on the event. 
except for Windows and the program also for the operating system Linux is available to ‘ McJobs ’ OS. 
On request one can make oneself send the placing cd home or into to office. 
meanwhile be unpaid can be an incentive for the spread of the programme in the homes, so it is also just in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the big picture: finally already different furnishings of the public administration and schools proceeded with OpenOffice. 
In fact not even a training - offer what means an optimum aid for small and medium-sized companies, and reveals an optimal aid for small and middle enterprises even to business prospects thus is missing. 
OpenOffice consists of five major components: Writer the word corresponding text creation program; Calc, that table programme that aims at a displacement from Excel; Impress, for the preparation of presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases of the better-known access; and at last Draw, a diagram module. 
It is The goal for the year 2008 to reach 5 million downloads - a goal, that at already now reached 3 million and 600 thousand also easy can be exceeded. 
also Kohl positively tested and in this way the fourth Dopingfall 
A new Dopingfall mi opens frames of the last Tour de France: it is a question of the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, that as Drittklassifizierter and winners of the shirt of the best Kletterers. 
The News published the daily newspaper L 'team on their website. 
The 26 - year old cabbage of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested for Cera, the Epo of the third generation, positively. Before this already with the Italians struck Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analyses from the blood we appertain to those that in the past few weeks laboratory Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry were made. 
the The processor can always bring confirm the positive results now on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and to be excluded from the race for two years. 
The chief of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and informs also the responsible Austrian ones according to Associated Press. 
The 26 - year old Austrian climbed behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans onto the podium and claimed also the shirt of the best Kletterers for themselves further. 
TOPIC IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy ", this former country of immigrants is recently one of the preferred countries for immigrants became", which ones only with reluctance are incorporated. 
Do this from the Belpäse a nation of racists? The New York Times asks this in a long article, which is dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy very in Italy and goes out of the case of the young one, from Burkina Faso stämmigen Abdul William Guibre, that a month ago into Milan was murdered after that having stolen a package of biscuits. 
The case shows that, what the Times as "paradoxical of the North describe": the northern regions are those, in these "at the meisten integration and work possibilities" exist, and nevertheless "this highest degree at anti-immigrationistischen sentiment and to record the Lega Nord the most support is". 
As confirmation of the wachsenden tension between Italians and immigrants that one appoints itself Times onto other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only this. 
Also the new one, by the Lega eingebrachte legislation against immigration and for to accelerate expulsion of illegal immigrants is mentioned than signs of climate change in Italy. 
A movement which the pope and the president underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal around a cooperation between church and state for to combat racism. 
Students victims of the rent prices high up to 900 - euro per room 
The market for apartments for studying does not know any crises. 
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros into Milan, of 700 in Florence, in 650 in Naples and in 600 in Rome. 
"this phenomenon accepted already very serious trains. Whole numbers of students lose so actually their right to study since their families are not in the situation they in this level support" - so the party responsible of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities lead the great demand on the part of the students for a deformation of the market that harmed the other inhabitants. 
Furthermore most rent bids contain a series of offences: free contracts lack of registrations, without rent boundary, illicit subtenancies. 
For the Sunia the need exists according to extraordinary measures which lead to lower rents through a revision of taxation. 
In the case of more precise consideration of the investigation turns out, that into Milan a dormitory accommodation in the quarter of Brianza approx. to be required 450 euro; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the quarter of bands Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 Euro in the quarter of Vittoria. 
In Florence a dormitory accommodation costs on the average in 350 / 400 euro a room 700. 
In Bologne, where the students concentrate in the quarters at the University, are in 250 / 280 euro for a dormitory accommodation of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome the prices are near approximately 600 euros in the quarters around the unicolored ones for a single room, 450 for a dormitory accommodation in a double room. 
the rent are only little deeper in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only who avoids into outlying districts can save money: To 300 euros for a dormitory accommodation and to 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, to Centocelle and to similar accommodations. 
In Naples benötig one 300-450 euros for a sleep place, for a room the price suits to between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive areas, to the Policlinico, to Vomero and to Colli Aminei. 
In Bari a dormitory accommodation costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350. 
In the smallest towns the prices are lower, nevertheless they have a greater weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities in which the phenomenon of the rental is more frequent onto non-European students as about in Perugia, even a further anomaly exists: a renting, which lie about the average around 25 to 30%, are required by foreign students. 
On reunions to the old movie theater Paradiso - the towns lock their historic cinemas 
The historical movie theaters close due to the favored multichannel movie theaters. 
"one city without cinemas is a blind city, as a face without eyes. 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore currently describes something with effect in the large urban centres Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters which began with the birth of the big multihall complexes in the periphery means in the long term the death for the one eel cinema in the center. A process which does not appear only unabwendbar and irrevocably, but supports also the trains of a cultural crime. 
Mostly historical places of full memories are affected ", to lose as a friend" it is, with which one a piece streets of full of emotion put back plan ", so the director of the film" Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", which brought in the Oscar and the big prize from Cannes for him 20 years ago. It is a question of the history of a Vorstadtkinos and his nostalgia which consists of living in a presumably forever lost movie theater world. 
The figures, which the particular, the central trade association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the past five years the enormous amount of 316 of traditional movie theater had to close; the cinemas paid this bill to for the most part of in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 into Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most strongly affected areas belong Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost movie theaters, followed from the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows the main culprits being the multichannel movie theaters, because it is just these three areas in which the greatest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"this business has in an irrational manner develop", so Paolo Protti, the president of the particular ", it is useful indeed, that new structures turn out, nevertheless at first place the receipt of the already existing one stands, because a hall closes in the city, all his regular customers are not ready to consult a multichannel cinema instead of the old one in the periphery. 
And here still the lack of budget remains for the ground of the trade association of äusser care: the burden of debt noted by the state is approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical position that the government does not pay attention to the existing laws. 
In order to receive the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be per in the year of needs ". 
The case of Bologne, the first Italian city to decide due to of about the old cinemas on protecting these through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is a question of that to protect first descendants of this kind in Italy, which aims at that, the traditional movie theaters and to support, and this both in the historic centre, than also in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience concerning the local traffic's: it will be allowed to go into the traffic - limited fields of the centre and in addition to park to more favorable parking fees. 
"it a pleasant Initiative is", so Giuseppe Tornatore ", I hopes, that other cities will follow our example and in addition also still project new concepts. 
Certainly, however, we need also a better audio and video equipment in order to be able to achieve something against the superpower of the multichannel halls, because finally the public is from today more pretentious. 
The defense of the traditional movie theater was always an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that brought me for this purpose this "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to found, even if I had played with the idea already since 10 years ago. 
Since 25 years I live in Rome; when I pass by at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I experienced so many different emotions, I turn myself to on the side in order not to have to see the dust - overcast posters. 
'Leading' The links' to the arrest of the mayor 'between politics and' Ndrangheta from Gioia Tauro 
"this mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready, to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia groups Piromalli. 
The accusations of the disbarment of the anti-Mafia - authority of Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Gioia Tauro that this morning was arrested because of involvement in mafia activities are fatal. 
Into taken handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older agent was taken between the clan and the public administration, as well as that nephew: the attorney that carries the same name as the boss of the clans had been condemned already because of involvement into criminal organisations of the Mafia, then too an indemnity of 10 million euros. 
"every sort of moral and legal standard disregard", so the lawyers write ", to pay the attorney Piromalli Gelder for consultation activities," have the two local administrations decided. 
"Thus it had been made possible for the mafia groups - so the judge - to penetrate town halls on official way and to have a say in the policy of the public administration." 
The president of the regional committee of Kalabriens Agazio Loiero does not deny, that it in its region "everything other than an exception is to bump onto links from local administrations and the organized crime." There are places in which the concentration is greater to of the Mafia than in other ones in which such links are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians who 'resist' to the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta': Heroes who keep a perfect for themselves. " 
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April the town council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, nevertheless already 1991 - and also then due to alleged combinations between organized crime and the local administration - the local politicians their town councils had been relieved. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as the head of the middle right coalition according to the run-off election in May 2006. 
He shouted scandal than the police ordered the dissolution of the parish council. 
He prosecuted on that into the Vizeinnenminister Marco Minniti that he accused, all for political - strategic reasons to have invented. The judges but, declare in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli - clan had even dared to apply for a change of the A3 - project it. 
From a listening - action in connection with the investigations for the case Dal Torrione, the willingness to comply with the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative is to the large group as is generally known around the Piromalli was proved - through which the measures of public administration became identical with the interests of this clans.

If the energy originates from the waves, the large ones accumulate suddenly 
It is a not versiegende money source, which one above 70% of the surface of the planet covers and the big energy companies of the world do not seem this before now understand. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy onto those ones now all look, and also to occupy seek, such giants as Chevron. 
The possibility to gain vigor from the movements of the sea is already since 70 years taken into account and examined; not by chance these studies were intensified since the first oil crisis considerably. 
When the price of to in 1980 started around 1980 vergas one the idea of the energy from the sea now, however, environmental organisations and the climbed the price of oil would insist on new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London reckons that 15% of the Worldwide energy demand of the vigor produced through the ocean waves could be covered. 
This would amount to the double one of the vigor currently produced through nuclear power stations. 
In addition the currents and tidal would in addition still come. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company to put on the energy from the sea now is Enersis who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in 2005 in northern Portugal. 
When This news was published it seemed to act around a revolutionary step. 
It is two years later now more and more to firms from the traditional energy policy that put on the marine energy production. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" - so the speaker of an enterprise, known to the American Giants, in the Wall Street Journal - and the possibility to cooperate with us considers. " 
It is a question at that of to obtain a listing from the American energy commission which is necessary in order to start a project before the coast Alaskas. 
This is a sign not to be underestimated, before a. if one considers that just in Alaska oil keeps on being won through the United States and president Bush got first the plans going recently for new borings. 
Next to chevron also the companies are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey that invest in the new industry; nevertheless, if the details are not known, observers speak so of an increasing interest. 
Still improvement - worthy technologies. 
Experts speak of a technology being still in the departure, this last but not least, since the last doubts are not yet clarified on the part of the environmentalists. 
Up to now projects such as the one are in Portugal and also Scotland rather small dimension and no ecological problems to be taken seriously to cause shine. 
In order to produce vigor, however, in a large scale, it needs technologies with far greater influence on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power about is useful a system of buoys joined with each other. 
The shear of the waves that moves the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers about plungers and magically. 
This drives a turbine which practices in turn a generator. 
The electricity is sent on that about run-off water management to the coast. 
Until now there is four planned plant this kind that only still waits for the state approval. A part of the gained vigor could serve also for military facilities. 
Meanwhile Verdant Power produces already energy for a product department store and a flap park with the aid of submarine turbines in the East River from New York. 
The movements of water drives during the tidal the turbines that feeds the generator through the arising rotary motion. 
According to Verdant been a long queue of potential clients waits for the necessary authorizations around these energy sources are useful. 
Only the waves then the tides. 
The Potenzial who is in the tides earns a special interest at the moment according to the institute for power generation investigation. 
Nevertheless, although it is a question also of an irregular phenomenon the tidal are better predictable as wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a trustworthier power source. 
Just the tidal power it is, which Federal state as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states brought to investing dollars in the year 2008 in the year 2008 - for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
