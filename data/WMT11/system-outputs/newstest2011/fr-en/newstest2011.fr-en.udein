That is what will happen? CSSD has nothing more nor Voldemort or pastries to Prague.
The newly elected and CSSD to the mayoralty of the capital should apparently overcome a real language barrier to understanding at the level of the council with their new and old DOS collegues.
Actualne.cz the newspaper was "tested" the new members of the council from CSSD, whether they know the argôt who was born during dernieres of years to the city hall, when the partners of the present coalition that headed to Prague.
Terminology encoded that cream Prague policy was set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem has described some personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
I was surprised that it was discovered that the new elected do not understand the words very well known.
At least say-they.
Valdemort 'is ."
"I really do not know.
"I am a politics jeunôt pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture to test vocabulary the 'Godfather'.
And as regards the veteran politician, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
E.g. the sense of "hole of golf."
"It is the only expression among those that you suggest that I use '
Otherwise, I may not use the argôt.
Of vocabulary, which the newspaper published the Aktualne.cz expressions in June of this year and then the turf congrés-éĺectoral of the ODS, the Editor chose six examples, primarily those who are related with the town hall in Prague.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of 'Voldemort,' 'the biggest hole of golf in Prague ," patisserie "' sinews of beef," "betrayal of the capital" and 'entôler ."
Three of those elected were in agreement for the quiz, quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, who must lead education to Prague in the future - was promised first an interview but then has not taken up the telephone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek was flatly refused the test.
"I do occupy me of all of these things there and enjoy how representatives of civic democracy: I am not going to give my opinion."
"I am dealing with the process of how we understand in the context of our programmes," we have reacted.
As has already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would recognize not apparently in the legend sprung-upper hand, that we are talking about the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
'Voldemort "says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression he has guessed in the test is" the greatest golf hole to Prague ."
'Blanka it is the tunnel' said Kaucky and immediately added: "I know of the newspapers ."
"I will have to pay for the courses in the language ', pleasant t it.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment know that the hole in golf is the tunnel Blanko.
The two social-democrats know who is really and Voldemort Plachy Lukas knows where finding the man - he believes within the meaning of 'go to the pastries ."
"It is, I think, to go in a company," is loan Plachy guessing that this is the headquarters of companies of Janousek.
Brezina recalls on the same tone that it derives its knowledge instead of newspapers and not of any language he would use.
According to the candidates, there are no testing of lexicon argôt in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we really did not something of this kind."
"It was rather the names some time use of abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Party socio-economic-democrat, that Party staff call Hulda.
"I called Briza to school but I don't know if my colleagues call as, confess Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
Weinert is Papy for the elected members of the ruling or the least friendly old Little, the representative Miroslav Medak, who drew attention on him before the elections by fraud during sponsorship of the Party, is nicknamed 'the little joujou ."
The nicknames are the only ones that admit work within the party the Social-Democrats.
Hulinsky it seems that not much heard Hulda, but the newspaper recorded another nickname Akutel.cz to Prague this President.
"Doctor in Law of batons' recalls seems-it that Petr Hulinsky has obtained a doctorate in law JUDr.à bratislava of the police academy.
The government wants to decrease the torture of "witches," has published a booklet.
Burkina Faso, the women declared witches have common characteristics.
They are part of the old generation, may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are free and have no children.
One that becomes "witch" is isolated for not threaten the rest of the village.

"Over 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso is not read," warned the newspaper Die Standard about the problem of education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other countries.
Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman 72 years died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil had over.
Is the server of the BBC which has sent this information.
Criminals claim that it was the wrong eye.
In their version the oil which is used for ritual emflammée onctions was in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, looks-it, when the team wanted to "banish the bad spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year Burkina Faso: 'The eaters of human minds have always represented a danger ," said he.
While Burkina Faso is trying reduce the witch-hunt, the Gambia not just in the last year has even seen the President-even participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch-hunt that, story-it, would have been involved in his death and reportedly tried by the black magic to kill the President."

Bakal the lessee of: Poèles heat, he signed up to a higher rent.
An old man placing went out the door of the centre of society RPG Byty customers' coal baron "Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rental units in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a dossier with three new contracts to three rental apartments: His own, that of his daughter and his son, who was serving a sentence.
Deregulation has done increase the rent to these three people.
Instead to pay 3,500 the son should pay from next year for a flat 2 + 1 second category 4100 kronor.
"And there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel, " shows the finger on the new contract of his son, who has the power of a signature.
"I signed, but when even" explains t he at motié angry and resigned at half.
Civic association flats BytyOKD.cz nouelles who described the rental arrangements as "immoral and shameful ," advises not to sign tenants and wait until 7 December, when it will be published a notice explaining the methodology for the claim.
But the man reacts to it with a gesture of the hand.
"One said this, the other said 'in the eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava is the laboratory of the deregulation.
After the New Year, it is this that looks most apartment in the Czech Republic whose rents do not reflect the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit personally the "laboratory."
The waiting room of RPG Havirovska in the street is one of four of the region of Ostrava and she is already full on Tuesday at 9 o'clock in the morning.
Right beside the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to draw customers.
Special a button, "rent 2011 ', is lit on the visor tactile.
One pressure and a paper with a fate of the aircraft.
You do not have the time to read your room 157 "that your number starts already be illuminated on the larger screen under the topit the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it is your turn.
After a short time being, an elderly couple arrive with hedging on rent, but the new rents do not appear to relate to the people in the waiting room.
Most people has come to solve common problems as everywhere - calls of reparations, events on insurance and others.
In the Ostrava, people more 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG benefit couriers with the new lease agreements in their letter box since approximately the mi-November.
RPG Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for the new rent is open to the public from 18 November.
"It works for almost a week, this is still to test 'answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client is presented as a journalist.
Déragulation and the apartments of the old minor Bakal are a local issue very sensitive.
Vice-President of the parliament and come from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek-of social democrats by reported fairly sustained before the elections, and that fulfils now the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new low."
'They have I not even changed a put... n in the windsurfing wc, relieves in introduction, mentioned.
However, it is mainly, according to employees, pensioners ahead to be confident that they will receive a rebate on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised RPG to a special offer.
This is a rebate half of rent will receive other loctaires which have signed their new contract by 15 December.
But the Window "deregulation" of the streets Havirovaska really is not saddled by the questions.
"Of the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 are for rent," said the employee at the ticket counters.
RPG porpose and yet both on its website that in the windows of individual interviews on rents where it is necessary.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent that is an independent court, which makes the decision.
They are not threats but only to inform on how single and legitimate to act legally ," indicates RPG on its website.
'Here nobody will go to court "believe one of RPG Byty and the man in the street before the customer centre that he is right.
CK 13000 "I have a pension and I have 5,000 crowns to eat, I have not had enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see.
'Mr. Zaoralek in the media ask that person signs and therefore the people are waiting,' says t it.
Regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, using RPGs Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents do not always reach the level required to maintain the fund for housing," said Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolio of the RPGs Byty society, that it is precisely the lack of funds for housing makes the lessee angry is the primary reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents apartments invest 4 billion in four years from 2011 was 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The great screen hung from the ceiling with armchairs padding around them which are in the waiting room of the rue Havirosvka, repeat, however, a few information shown in red.
Is increasing the rent by 2011 is 15 percent and no fewer than 31200 apartments is more than 90 per cent of the apartments of RPG ."
'And it will always be the more at CZK 7.50 on m2 per month ," said the screen.
An increase of 38 per cent is that 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, an increase of a sum really very low 19.66 at CZK m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but step-by-step on 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: All the money to the higher rents (cf. the graphe) is rendered the apartments in the form of economies of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase to rent have priority.
Kindergarten is part, too, of the officers included the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters the company Arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that he also harbours a mini nursery school with everything it needs - walls of bright colours are inventive furniture, toys and finally of a playground miniature on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can render children of employees Arch. design.
Society projects-architectural Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of construction in Brno, concocted its mini nursery business since the first drafts Avriopoint of the building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly age to have children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that employment contracts to time declined, nursery school is proposed a bonus to its employees by society Arch. Design. through its social agenda.
Manufacturers and architects and the opportunity to combine a job taking care for the children.
It is the employees who have imagined Arch.Design.eux-same this kindergarten and with the support of the leadership they have been unable to obtain funding from the European Union and of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded through the European Social Fund through the operational program of human resources and the state budget to the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the availability of funding ($2.8 mil.de CZK). They have been able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure qualified personnel as well as the road.
After the use of the money to funds (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.
Preparing the project lasted a year and this is the society Economy rating that has helped to make the request.
It to children is assured by qualified personnel, the whole day, a nurse and a teacher working with nursery children. Children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery" there cannot have that 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more than a substitute.
Operation of the school is flexible, according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the right to use the system without over the hierarchical position.
Agise although care and individual education, the programme of the mini nursery school are comparable to those for early childhood education.
Children do not that play but a quality education is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation to the benches of school teaches English.
Class is equipped not only toys and games but also imaginative a computer that the children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can at any time controlling their children and not having the stress of a delay in order to get children to a school far from the place of work of their parents.
Parents use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s' is so enshrined among the companies which offer a bonus for hiring new employees who are friendly towards the family and through this programme enhances marketing of RH.
The house still fascinates bones after 100 years. Take a look in the rear-view of down.
Toît the looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the stairway to a spine of dinosaur and the balconies to gueules fish open.
Thus was the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni down.
Because of its organic forms, the house has been the local nickname of Maison in bones.
Organic forms, colours wild-caught use unusual stones, fragments and rust-coloured mosaîque, facade recalling flakes and everywhere these curves is everything ypique to the Art Nouveau to Antoni down.
The front facade of the home conducted its lines of dream, its colours and textures pleasant that recall the nature and animals.
During a more detailed comment is the geometry, the pace and the next thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of glitter of colours is reinforced.
The material and the twisting forms also appears in the interior with the same measure.
Timber copy waves bundles of windows, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the and oeilleton lamelles.
Battlo the house that got up in the neighbourhood in the Eixample street merchant Passeig de Gracia to serial. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction was made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
Investor Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, was initially focused on the demolition vieile building and the construction of another entirely new but rapidly upheld down the idea of a rebuilding unusual and better market.
Casa Battlo but the idea as a house in multiple housing was not thought by down alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that have emerged the decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and use the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
Joint work for plans of the house Casa Battlo began by cooperation between Jujol succés and down.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house in Casa Mila and down the park Guell in which there are other works of down.
The premises have dubbed the house hot just after its completion because its organic forms' Maison in bones'.
Others, in light of the specific mechanism of opening windows have called 'the house that decaying ."
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the building include hidden religious grounds.
Down was thought to house a unique system in its time central heating, with vents chimney venting and typical.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the establishment down absolutely does not comply with the guidelines of building then and has not been constrained by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained on the part of the city the building permit, we know, of course that the data entered on the reconstruction plans were so vague that during the two years after finishing the town council was appalled and demanded changes.
It did not like, for example, members of the city council that the pillars empiettent of the construction on the public pavement.
There were ever to change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal to the city to Josep Battlo demanda (and appreciation) permission to rent the top two floors.
Déménagea the owner to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a shared lounge and the third a chamber and a private party of the apartment.
The rez-of-carriageway was leased to a jewellery store.
Full house of six floors is shared by a staircase by which access until a terrace of toît independent.
All the angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls curves.
Down worked also the modern concept of spaces.
Common can be linked the party completely by opening the doors of the bedrooms and the high company may communicate comfortably, or limit the private space for discussions more intimate.
The house down with the reconstruction of received also new facades toîture a non-traditional and two floors.
The game down with the light is also impressive, tiles are glass blue and white with which is decorated the inner courtyard and sinks of lights.
The stake in two colours gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
Could simply bet on the principle that white reflête more that the dark which instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo which was included in the 2005 Heritage Fund Global, of UNESCO can-be viewed by each.
The first floor of the house is the apartment the most spacious and the more splendid accessible to the public.
Owners have decided to take this step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They have continued the visitors as they found that it is a lucrative business, and they have expanded the scope of inspections to the common spaces and the granary including toît of the terraces.
Ticket into the monument is not really expensive and cost €16.50; students, pensioners groups and tourist card holders have 20 per cent discounts.
The sum is still to-top of the entry price at other constructions down in the city.
If you want to feel the atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tourelles, you have to quickly find a friend among residents of the building and a complete visit the house.
Choose how mattress and a bed: Women have other criteria than men.
Framework not ostentatious, but rather the quality of the surface area open at sunset, then the mattress and the bed are a real basis for a good read.
They must naturally complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
For selecting several things are key: The weight, size, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which it will place the mattress and the bed is also important.
A typical example?
E.g. in the house where there campaign never sleeps continually latex mattress are not suitable because they 'warm' slowly.
They have, in addition, a higher weight to mattresses in polyurethane standards.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they were not also enough ventilation channels in heart and if they remain, and more, on a solid wall, they hold moisture. Of mould can also be trained.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
That is the obvious time abroad where it uses frequently mattresses very thick with a layer rammollissante, feel hardly well on a lower surface and hard.
"It is so that all who return to NHL hokeyistes complain they cannot sleep here-low."
For their tired shoulders, legs and ribs, they need mattresses with a layer of foam rammollisante lazy ."
"Such mattress are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system which therefore shoulder badly 'information' joints and skin," explained Silva Adamczikova that specializes in furniture padding around them which are.
It is for this reason that a few years ago their mattress with foam lazy conquered the hokeyistes as well as other customers.
'Today, everything is turned well and Tempur, Italian Magnifex but Czech Tropico have mattresses for example.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to appreciate a mousse lazy.
This "miracle 'works simply.
It optimalise its rigidity and its form in the heat absorbed or adapts to the warmth of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not go back in the evening and after a difficult match.
Dormez you simply better.
Foam lazy also operates as a protection against esquarres.
Selection of mattress depending on your size, add the length its feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size to 180cm therefore need a bed from 210 / 220 centimetres.
The minimum width for each to a bed in two spaces should be 90 cm is in any 180 cm.
For beds in a single place, the singles for example, it is recommended at least to take 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in the event of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: When you are lying on our backs you should ask so comfortable with the hands together slightly complied. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators dedicated since several years the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of the furniture and were taught in the schools.
To a bed in two spaces each needs its own bed and mattress, so attention however during the achât choose up the mattress.
Otherwise you will to mount the bed at different heights and that is not achievable on all managers of bed.
The mattress foam should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattresses to springs at least 15cm, this count to the Ozone of form and venting at least three centimetres.
"the touching or sitting on the mattress you must not feel springs," prevents Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a determined type of bed.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed are Emirates as sisters Siamese, has nothing to do with sleeping quarters.
The mattress if aèrent very evil; we must not the wash, which is commonly auhourd' today.
Since during the night it is normally of 0.2 to 0.75 the sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress is beginning to recall a large sieve (and closed).
For it professionals refuse to make the claims over a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life.
But to his but.
And for this counsel experience on the part of sellers in a mattress of 120 / 140cm, dispensing, for coating of mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a buffer of protection that vouspouvez easily withdraw and washing.
And even if nowadays it is often to make surfaces with closure to slide for the whole thing, that is to say that, after the opening two parties (for the washing and the size of a washing machine is very important!) if not manipulation on major models (and for one person) becomes when they are cut up a fight between a light weight and a lorry on a ring.
You are in your bed a rigid wall instead of a bed?
Never ever!
Maximum to a bed for visitors for a single night.
However équipez do (if there isn't) ventilation holes and use the mattress to springs with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in sachets Taschenfederken (to Germany) and a layer of ventilation.
Mattress in polyurethane should not be part of a bed.
Shifted accidentally by the wind for at lamelles to unique position with 14 / 18 lamelles, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwichs (can-be a combination of latex, and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with greater lamelles, 28 and-above, where lamelles are doubled in the bottom of the stick and that it is thus possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattresses at several positions should not be made of mattresses spring-loaded since it does not respond to changes of position.
Has the tuning of the rigidity of lamelles locate also the so-called cradle of heart.
This is a special liaison lamelles is bringing pressure or even surrendering the gills are allowed to the shoulder of dormeur "fits" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the backs', this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by manufacturers of mattresses which to the 'male' began using a zone rammollissante at the shoulders.
But they also believe the women - they offer a new surface softest in the hip.
To the customer most difficult there are sommiers to wings or platelets with so-called multiforce a suspension.
Pressure will contaminate diinue in more points and the tension.
However, attention, once you use a good pillow (large and swollen to air) on good mattress and bed, 'plus' disparait.
The basic rule is pillow every simple: The pillow should support the head and his spines should achieve only the shoulders, for that muscles can relax the shoulders.
The size recommended 50x60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When it is lying on the side, the pillow should upgrade (with the cradle of the bed or the Shoulder rammollie zone in the mattress) the high shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something in common with the first straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural substances or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattresses.
The raw herbal pétrôle, to manufacture the polyurethane, are replaced with natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all manufacturers known use precisely the soya.
"Bio epithet for the mattresses means that the heart is manufactured from natural products," said Petr Vasicek of society Tropico Plus.
The natural substances are also used for the linings mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add of micro--capsules develop which perfumes of forest or lavande.
There are differences between the man and women.
While the extract from plants of birch for the coating of mattress absorbs heat and cool the body, "cools" the coatings "heat" women.
The extract of red poivre accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore hotter for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The mattress made from mousse cold (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure therefore more respirante that the polyurethane and has standard more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities cold gives foam mattresses polyzones who know precisely where the head, the lower back and foot.
You pay a mattress of quality from 7000 kronor and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have least of VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Economiser for the mattress and the bed is not simple.
We may from time to time as part of special activities on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattress for the price of one.
E.g. society which proposes Duofreeze Magniflex mattresses with foam to memory Memory sewn coating 11990 for crowns.
Can of course take the second charge.
Foam the era or lazy viscoélastiques with a cellular structure and open a large girth has been started with pace on the Tempur in a "cosmic."
This began as for NASA astronauts suffered parceque start-up of the huge load factors.
The Tempur rammollit be heat and is hardening, on the contrary, in the cold.
It adapts therefore perfectly the human body warm and circulate an optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Mosses viscoélastiques be used not only for the mattress but also for products to health, such as the ad hoc pillows for the feet which relieves veineux legs and the system.
Czech manufacturers use for example the foam or Twinsaver EucathermC or the same kind.
Appliances to monitor people are more and more requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about at the monitor with a GPS.
The system, introduced at the beginning to find cars may just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as shop exmple Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look at ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all people that this is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy" says Petr Pilin macro- Weil of society that is one of the suppliers for aircraft tracking on the Czech market.
"I concede that there may be instances of misuse of such appliances, such as putting it in the bag of a person who does not know, but I have yet to meet such cases."
"The majority of people are of customers who buy the product actually for security reasons add Pilin.
He think the children should always know for what purposes is used "on the box" and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to wear on him a thing of this type, it in débarassera.
'And even the smallest can demonstrate great creativity when it comes to ridding themselves express something when they do not want to be in control. "
"Mobile phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing have already led parents to long delays," contends Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of apparatus to be able to help in case of aggression is very questionable.
'It is an abduction prepared, the author is going to do everything possible to ensure that the child has no electronic apparatus that can trace him ."
"Currently, it is the phone."
"soon that will develop devices tracing, they (the criminals) are going to look for them, too, because the sale will be backed by an advertising campaign.
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She confess that such appliances can assist during an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of society RC Monitoring, which offers services to trace both for cars than for persons, says that to have this type of device could help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
Paramétré "the aircraft can be in such a way that it is in regular emission after a period of time."
"In cases where the aircraft was destroyed, it is the latest position of the person concerned."
'Appliances more ladies have also a point immediately inclinomètre the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a position - without moving, "said Cech.
He think the so-called smart phones equipped with navigation system, can offer a service comparable after formaté with a Special prologiciel.
The problem of tracing systems present is that there is either a similar apparatus with those concerns pendentif the size of a box of matches is the smallest aircraft.
Can always lose them.
Macro Pilina of society according to Weil is why testing is being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognise the tracing system."
'Or he realizes after a period of time, which will be given to the police a little more time ," adds-it.
That the tracing system is developed in the form of tags or pendentif it utilisiera always the very same technology to build cars.
It is a combination of systems to acquire a position through GPS (which is used routinely in autonavigation) and function of a mobile phone which the current position of a vehicle.
The Army a detonating calibres that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with, but it may take two years.
The Army has bought for 445 km calibres used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km.
Has the army reserves to 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of calibres is two to four years.
The Army bought detonating calibres to the limited company STV Group to 40 million kronor.
Major general-the state had given as a result of a huge quantity achât detonating calibres to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
Calculations of reservation to detain pyrotechniciens made by the army, that MF DNES contacted, it shows that even the generals, the officers having command, secretaries or the household staff should have an annual exercise with explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil PICEK, commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to justify the annual consumption rocketed 60 km of detonating calibres.
Has this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reservations of the army could support for 10 years.
If instead it is true that for the basis of every new professionals it suffices to more 2 m calibres detonating, as the experts say, this means that the military with his new acquisition has also guaranteed - with consumption special units and the genius - reservations for the 225 years.
Yet the soldiers from the Brigade of early intervention have recently complained to the Minister Vondra they did almost no ammunition for their handguns and that meetings of firing are limited due to the need for money.
Concerning the lack of underwear we do not talk about that.
'And I do not take the mind with they buy home such a large quantity to detonating calibres ."
"And it is their decision, and they really know what they are doing."
'For us the military is a good customer that we strive as shopkeepers to please, "said the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, door-floor of the Ministry of Defence, arguing the achât hundreds of km of detonating calibres by the fact that the army will take the "ammunition" on standby for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reported, however, only four years of life detonating pyrotechniciens calibres and the police and army of only two years.
'If they are perfectly stored in yards, this may go even up to four years ," said one officer who did not want his name published in light of the criticism of the army.
The time life past, each number has to be tested to see if it still incorporates and does not pose a threat to the life of a soldier.
These tests, however, are not cost free and still money.
The other argument the Ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km cordeux detonating.
'They have cost 60 percent less than the delivery of 245 km the past year ," said the door-floor Pejsek which is letting buyers view of the of the defence ministry.
Only to compare: The annual consumption of detonating pyrotechniciens calibres of police which circumvents munitions from the Second World War or the ones after the Soviet military, does not exceed 1,500 metres.
Control and the police always just the necessary quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
Stated for security reasons pyrotechniciens of and to be able to obtain in a more flexible way of detonating calibres types of more modern and more reliable.
The Ministry of Defence now has massive problems for the neutralization of dozens of tonnes of munitions from the time the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army strong two hundred thousand men prepared to travel, heading on the Rhine.
Which expects in some years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: Neutralizing hundreds of kilometres of detonating calibres old that it buys today "on the cheap."
Until today I benefit of contacts that I obtained through the competition.
Sale under franchise his hotel was well assisted Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the best individual Entrepreneur.
Examination the winner of the best individual Entrepreneur for the past year have been Lukas Pytloun, contractor of 28 years.
Its adventure succés to the is like a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, he has realized that he lacked at Libérec a residential site quality at a reasonable price.
Of its economies about what he had earned while working abroad, and with the assistance of a bank loan it purchased a small apartment 5 apartments, half demolished.
Acknowledging he was still studying trosième year of higher studies, it was a courageous efforts.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region was inspired to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started has rent the first apartment rebuilt with foreign workers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building that it transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since this time-here, its action of contractor allowed it to open for Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of some 300 beds all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year it came another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U tise where we sold our concept of openness and other potential franchise hotels Pytloun expressed," the number 1 of entrepreneurs of the past year.
'And for the sale of the licences for the establishment of a functioning hotel large-scale victory to the help of the entrepreneur of the year has been well served, adds Pytloun with recognition.
Victory provided more popular and to be experienced to Libérec and its environs.
"I recognize people in the street, often complimented me and, I must say, that it was very nice," recalls-it.
It recommends participation in this competition for all those who are trying to do something.
This is not necessary to win but any opportunity of being visible is good.
It said that until today he uses its contacts and knowledge that he could not obtain in a different way.
"With those that I have met with the help I have started to trade regularly.
To him, fame succés linked to has had an impact on the employees.
And it has about 70.
"I look at home above all the loyal and proud to be engaged in something that has been generally acknowledged."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job, all of us together.
"Just my name is driven forward ', said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Through the objective of winner Farmet has the worst moments behind itself.
Who has come seeking the dum Slovansky price to the top of the examination for the d of the year held by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky Farmet the owner of the company.
The jury reward the efforts with which he transformed a workshop of Ceska Skalice tools in a firm to the turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the rewards encouraged not only me my also my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence to combat competition," declares today the winner of the competition last year.
The beginning of the history of society Farmet there had the desire to do something useful.
And thus when the state offered to father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the tiny workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, was denied a career in a company where he was working at the time, and has created a company with a few comrades in the entourage of his father to the baths in manufacture of plastics.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after ten-eight years the biggest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized audience after the achieved succés the competitions through the media.
"not just our customers have started to really better Farmet know the brand but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company that has received the greatest succés in his country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year does E has not risen to only Farmet ldans the euphoria of victory.
Evaluation of the company had been made based on economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery engineering.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin limiting their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped to the situation."
'Figures of cases have fallen 40 per cent, and we restricted our dûmes production and even dismiss, "said Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society should know that from time to time we must take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation correctly and have retained bénéficiares results even if they were less than what they had before the crisis.
Nevertheless Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built with the endowments a centre of education and research - have strengthened the presentation of society in lounges-exhibitions international and won the main awards in the exhibition 'Zdarsky said.
Any leaves us to believe that the crisis was behind them.
Figures Affires back and, with them, the number of employees as well.
"I wish the new winner this pleasant buzz of victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which abolishes mindless regulations.
The investigation on the absurdity of the year for the fourth time is some of the clan affairs.
Certain absurd regulations have been removed.
The inglorious winner this year of the inquiry on the absurdity of the year was the need to address, in the Offices of the papers that the officials may obtain it-line.
4,000 more than a third of voters have voted for it.
For example, the government of Social Affairs requested a paper produced the commercial register while the official can obtain in two clicks of the mouse.
Change thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of Social Insurance will ask more from the Commercial List for controls on insurance payments," explained Jana Buranova, door-floor of the Administration of the Czech Social Insurance (CSSZ).
Highlighting all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and to delete those absurd is the sense of this competition the absurdity of the year.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time an part of the clan affairs Hospodarske noviny organized by and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voting have emerged, it is at least 4,000 this year who have made their voices.
And it is not surprising, it gets in our country the most various legal obligations which are milestones the company, and that, increasingly.
"We are perhaps-be among documents to fill for the tax declarations the first places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of the entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal declared all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is to the 74 eighteenth place regarding the conditions for the debtor or 8 places more compared with last year.
Assistance the absurdity of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continued every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can mention each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To pay it in ya the website www.firmaroku.cz. Secondly, the organizer of the competitions select seven candidates for "antiprix" and allows the public to vote in the month of October on the site and on / absurdita www.firmaroku.cz www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the final survey last year, it is about 100, or more exactly 105 décrêts regulations and who have lost their meaning of existence.
Remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the trade unions and teachers.
Among other "finalists" the competition, therefore among the nominees are for example, the requirement that vehicles with maintenance of highways and fast lines to pay the tolls, or although entrepreneurs with twenty employees repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the examination, which always starts at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a regular happening involving figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic, have been watching the climax of the competition.
'Economic prosperity can not function when the State puts âtons legs contractors and for this my goal is to abolish, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicates the business, " declared Martín Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to delete décrêts absurd is not a dead duck.
In 2007, which the people did not like was the obligation to declare three days before to room for individual firms to the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or pélerinage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the Ammendement of the Law on individual firms.
The second requirement in 2007 most enthusiastically supported, which was to tell the Labour Office travel service of a foreign employee on 30 days, was withdrawn with the text of the law on what we call the Green Card.
And everything is ok up to the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the décrêt for the physiotherapists of having a large mirror in their cabinets, a fridge and two scales.
It has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a fridge had been deleted.
A new category will reward firms socially responsible.
Are evaluated the environmental projects, humanitarian, training or sports.
Novelty of this year of the contribution in Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists since 5 years is the category called the d officer-in-charge of the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support to the company to be reasonable and fair.
"We want to support the companies that monitor the impacts of their company on the environment and are conducting an active socially responsible ," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile telephone operator, Vodafone the firm, which is the guarantor and promoter of the competition, as in the case of the examination for the rebel of the year.
For the first year of this under-category of the assistance of the firm of 2010, the firm held by Vodafone, have registered companies that do not have a single succés with long-term target for the company.
The adventure of each is full of inspirations and an article would be to publish independent.
Although the subject of their business is different from one to the other we can see their business support and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this is about people with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not the example prologiciels pragoise Netera And society which supports the creation of teams to their informal employees involved then to number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of the company responsible for the region of Pardubice Isolit-Bravo is society who was for 17 years the main contributor to the endowment fund which sponsors children with disabilities.

Had Olomouc is MiRyz Soft, a finance company, was the clear winner for having introduced more flexible working hours and even declined up to 35 hours a week on average, and this, without, proportionellement, cutting wages.
The jury it déverné the title also because it primarily manufacturers achête Czech, supports ditoyenne activity in the immediate environment and concern about the environment.

Fund and the Lands in Plzen, police made some arrests during a public contest
Building Fund for the Lands in Plzen, police anti--corruption has made arrests in recent days.
The detectives have handcuffed the local contractor and property dealer Lubos.
That-CI had tried to manipulate a public tender to the settlement of a claim for the return in such a way that the land proposed either obtained by a candidate determined.
That-CI should pay to Lubos G. half a million kronor.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police continue an individual for insider dealing in a competitive bidding and an public concour." Stated for newspaper Pravo the head of Public Prosecutions of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more details because the investigation is ongoing.
Policemen have handed over after 24 hours this contractor of 46 years in freedom.
To see how he could influence a public competition, we can only speculate, given the little official information.
Has a question Pravo, the door-floor 'Land Lubomira Cerna reported that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a separate workplace and, in the course of a public competition.
"He was a client and in no way an employee has-they said.
Cerna to the public competition has as true name "Appeal to propose, for the transfer of land according to the Law on the earth 'and is established when demonstrating several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"They propose, in the part of the appeal, a higher value of their Rights to resitutions that must be resolved before being announced the value of the ground."
"According to the proposed rights a classification of purchasers is established and the Fund transferring of Land then the field with the person who suggested the rights most senior," explained the door-floor of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information about people who had enrolled to the appeal and it is him-same, also, a person bénéficiare as having purchased a large number of rights for refunds, he had proposed candidates to the ground not to participate in the competition.
Encaissait and it probably to withdraw.
Which would explain why it was so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts largely into standards FDT-above the Fund (the Land).
It was in the case of the former leader of the Vaclav Sankot-FDT which was prosecuted criminally for editing of the land for which it had already published the decision to set up a construction.
Lubos precisely G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications in lieu should be constructed where the artery access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he échangea with the municipality to a building in the historic centre of the city and its value is far higher.
City Hall was forced to accept because otherwise she might put the building in peril by a blockage of land.
Households will pay an additional 100 kroner monthly for the housing.
Households will from January pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, the supplies of heating and in some areas rents will increase too.
Families will from January be drawn from their door-currency up to 100 crowns on a monthly basis more than now.
Electricity increases of 4.6 per cent, the gas to almost 2 per cent more expensive and in some areas you will have to pay up to a tenth of the provision of water, and in many places, the supply of central heating will also be more expensive.
Increasing electricity should be nearer for households in apartment the 100 kroner anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic cells.
Gas is increasing modestly but, of course, at a time when people need it the most to heat, and thus the largest consumption.
It can rely also 100 kroner in more.
Well as electricity and gas are rising throughout the Czech republic, the change in the cost of central heating is from city to city.
This is mainly the biggest Commons who plan the price rise.
E.g. households to Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating to nearly 50 more kroner a month, families of more 1,000 kroner Libérec foot annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation to the case when the city increases the rent infrastructure.
If rents do not change when paying an extra 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague will yet amongst the lowest compared with the entire country.
Bohemia in the North, where prices are already a part of the most high, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase, for example, substantially in 450 thousand rental apartments from January that is to say at the end of regulation.
E.g. Byty ICC society which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, agreed an increase of up to 100 per cent.
Those who are not in agreement with the new increase rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Rent regulated that paying people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year of 10 percent.
Czech children saoûlent to rum and Fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and acting slowly.
The Fernet, rum, vodka and an exceptional contribution also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
This are drinks that cause most often those saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is a result of the experience doctors facing cases similar admissions departments children hospitals.
"Beers and wines are no longer fashionable, as it takes time to be saoûl."
'Trend is really to the spirits ," indicates to Pravo Ludek Pelikan, the department head and children's hospital in central Bohemia Horovice.
"When they manage to chiper a bottle to Daddy in the wardrobe, he is sometimes wisky but the prevailing Fernet and the vodka '.
"Vodka this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not feel its," said the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, door Motol-floor of the hospital, also ensures her right.
"General, this is of rum or of Fernet."
"I today alcohol to the mode especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has acted slivovice they drove to the house," has added Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, see children drunk, aged 13 to 14 years for hospital admissions was a normal phenomenon.
Before work towards Horovice since last year, it was at Motol where he worked 10 years precisely in paediatrics where ambulances sent schoolchildren of wider environs drunk.
A young girl was taken to hospital and four time
'She acommencé his career to twelve years old when she was fed with 3.5 for thousand dansle with alcohol blood in more a mixture with extasy ," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"It was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice to a party ."
'What is interesting is that it did not was bizarre to the mother that her daughter be absent 48 hours "said astounded the Director of the Department.
Precisely the selflessness of their tolerance both parents or out of the ordinary with the fact that their rejection had to drink that are the main cause of the development of alcohol for children.
According to the specialists, is however not the dependence, in its narrowest sense, for the children.
'In the eyes is a chronic alcoholic dependency on alcohol for several years with all its attendant phenomena but that are not found among children ."
"Among those who use the acool to repetition, it is rather an expression-ground socio-economic-families significantly adverse " explained the Chief of Department Pélikan.
-floor Jurinova in the door, some forty children drunk have been hospitalized this year until the middle-November in the clinic of paediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated stastistiques that in the cases with a brainwashing grâve requiring hospitalization.
Children drunk who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police, are not counted.
Addition children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school an exsite Pélikan three waves that seasonal with whom one can count: The witches day, St Sylvester and the end of the school year.
'Or they drink by spite after bad results or, on the contrary, they are celebrating the start of the holiday period ."
"Of course I have lived to the witches day admission of 7 children drunk at a stroke," stressed Pélikan.
Children drunk who spent the night in the hospital in under medical désintoxciation paradoxically is in a better position than the one which went home and suffering the aftermath of the "hangover."
The headaches of the morning caused by dehydration and a lack of a glucose are removed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are to this better off since they spend a very good evening then awakening and a sweet nothing their hurts."
'They are just astounded whereabouts ," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time it blights the good humour of the patients at least note to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and hospital intensive care bed on up to tens of thousands.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education with these children that their inebriated has cost, and that they could spend the entire summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However the insurance companies in their health management in regression, which should restore the side of parents the charges relating to health care, do not address the cases of children drunk.
The two aeroplanes-159 for the first time are in foreign hands in Spain.
The two aeroplanes-159 of five in all, against which the Ministry of Defense had shared transport aircraft Casa C-295M, departed Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the aircraft seat manufacturer EADS Casa-.
This is the first time that the aircraft of this type becomes the property of someone else that the Czech army.
They have however been abroad as part of exercises / demonstration flights.
There are L-159T1 biplaces versions of which were until now in service in the Czech army and were in condition to vol.
Remaining aircraft lestrois monoplaces are versions of L-159.
Those-CI are berthed at the moment among Vodochody and Aéro through commercial - the firm Omnipol - were taken into account the last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physics of aircraft starting Vodochody is currently unknown.
'L-159 monoplaces aircraft planned for the exchange had been taken on had stored for a long time without charges or additional investment for the Ministry of Defence ."
"T1 biplaces L-159 have been exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
It has pay-for-performance that the army will not fall without biplace since the ministry has signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement valued at 200 million crowns for transforming four monoplaces L-159 biplaces unused in two.
Military has taken delivery of the first plane in July, the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
Pejsek according to EADS pledged to introduce the aircraft equipment to certain countries in the alliance.
"In the contract is clearly stated that whoever takes aircraft L-159 into account is EADS and that they will be used for pilot training members of NATO."
"It is therefore the case of the one that takes into account how to achieve this ," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-band-159.
Exchange five L-159 for an aircraft the Casa and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched bidding and was directly contacted EADS.
The direction of defending were arguments while the exchange provides a future export of L-159 abroad.
Czech army bought and Aéro Vodochody 72 aircraft uses that 24, trying to sell the rest.
Aircraft purchases Casa will probably have legal implications.
The European Commission has yet lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen through a tender at the European level and in no cases by contacting the manufacturer.
The Army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the latter should arrive on Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
Index longer that the ring is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longest annular the index that are exposed to less risk for cancer of the prostate.
Is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British journal Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone the testosterone-driven types.
"Our findings show that the length of finger test is simple risk of prostate cancer, especially in men before age 60," proclaimed the co-Ros Eeles author of the study, Professor at the Institute for Research on the cancer at the University of Warwick.
Her finger could help identify men should undergo testing for prostate cancer, including combining with the genetic risk and other factors the antécedents aggrâvants as family health, Eeles said.
During the period from 1994-2009 it has follow-up with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time on nearly three thousand men to eat.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand is shorter than the ring.
For them as for the 19 per cent of those who had fingers the same length, it found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the longest annular the Index that the risk is nonetheless fallen to 33 per cent, in men before age 60 the decreased risk has reached 87 percent.
Length of the report of two fingers cited - trained during the antenatal period - including different levels of sex hormones, which is briefing the child in the womb.
Has less testosterone-driven types correspond an index longer.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone-driven types which development aid of cancer of the prostate.
Paces the pprofesseur Vacla, renowned Czech généticien and former president of the Academy of Sciences, had said for KTC that it is aware of it although it seems not, story-it, that the relationship between the length of digits and the cancer is "totally proven."

Its missiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
Special munitions size 25 mm developed for this gun and containing a highly explosive, as works in fact small grenades.
Can plan the ammunition so that they will be in contact with the target, but also to any item of their ballistic trajectory.
We can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected from above and when it is upon a deadly rain of shrapnel of steel, it can make it inaccessible for combat, too.
Audette according to Richard which took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon which uses technology 'intelligent'.
"Gilad is using mainly so he will find the target, it sends a laser beam to determine the distance, is a point of view, that it corrects its targeted site and supported on the rebound.
'Say that you referred to 543 metres ."
'When you pressez détente, the weapon is burden and shoot to the distance of 543 metres more or less (1, 2, 3 metres, Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, almost 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is now in the office building of the Place Mareinbader Bad Homburg in the region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As affirmed the giant Wednesday that specializes in the production and maintenance computers, next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, to date, on the place Marienbader the city of Bad Homburg, will be redeployed to Astro Park, enormous complex of offices located on the street for the Quartier Lyoner Straße Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A door-floor of Fujitsu has explained that, in the medium term, the group is expected to consolidate further scattered 100 other jobs so far in the region.
Rental supply was extremely attractive. Offices in the area open to Astro Park agree better the work of assistants.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu has been right tenant.
Director-General, Bernd Wagner said, "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a central location with excellent infrastructure."
It affirms that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new removal of a major company in the region attracted yesterday joy caused disappointment winners and losers.
The economic head of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player " had been conquered.
This is a "wonderful profession of faith on the location ."
Fujitsu is in the city, and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg the mayor, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), Fujitsu regret the decision.
Direction soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our full support to this business," stated Mr. Korwisi.
However, Friendly Relations would do nothing to change the difficulties of computer manufacturer deal with the owner of the building on the Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
Is now only one place to avoid exceptional if left unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and licensor of the building will be cooperative."
10 years ago, the real estate of the Place of the Hotel de Ville, used so far by the company, Fujitsu and the 'small vertical' neighbour, as well as the rest of the buildings the Place des Marienbad, was part of the draft construction controversial of the spa.
Result of a joint project between the city and a private developer of projects, a new entrance to the town was created between the station and the Town Hall. Anyone-CI elicited widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of surfaces that were formerly part of a parking lot, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company from ratings and advice from investment, Feri, the computer manufacturer to the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time, even joined Siemens, have moved into the buildings.
In 2006, The German group of specialized Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought buildings occupied by Fujitsu in the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley; a year later, the buildings have been sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments S.A. based in Madrid.
Fujitsu the group headquartered in Tokyo considers itself the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it was computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the region of the Rhine-Main is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu surely much more of employees in Munich.
Branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company appointed TDS.
For this, 7,000 meters have hired in the Silwan Astro Park.
This old complex of 20 years ago, whose name recalls his plan in the form of star, among other houses the headquarters of the Swiss Confederation in the electronics industry and electrical engineering.
Deportation of the server through Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly difficult.
Supplier of Internet services Amazon has removed from its servers the site specializes in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude can cache-be political pressure endured after the publication of hundreds of thousands of confidential diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder, Mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
States-US, the Wikileaks site is attacked with still more force.
The Group for cyber-activists "Wikileaks' no longer had access to his server hosted so far in America and is now seeking an ISP in Europe.
During this time, the prominent US Senator, Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Grande-Brittany, according to information published by newspapers.
"WikiLeaks removed from the server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression the country of freedom," indicated Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists behind the revelations through the social network Twitter.
Little earlier, cyber-firm, Amazon, had deleted documents to Wikileaks from its servers.
After the publication of the memos secret diplomatic, cyber-activists have used of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Great, our dollars are now spent caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
CNN TV, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon had banned to Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation carried out by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
President of the Senate committee for the protection of land had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott to him, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon take this measure earlier in connection to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
Parallel, Mr. Liebermann has urged other countries to refuse the use of servers for the platform.
"WikiLeaks is acting illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. So doing it puts our national security at risk and threatening the life all over the world," according to a press release of independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should assist Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
WikiLeaks founder, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information compiled by the London newspaper "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years was living in Britain and Scotland Yard know exactly where it would find it.
Cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the prosecutions brought against it by Sweden.
The door-floor of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats had been made against the site.
'Calls have even been made to murder to Julian Assange. "
Assange is why fears especially for its security, has stated Hrafnsson.
Is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson reacting obviously to statements made in North America.
America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the perpetrators of the revelations by Wikileaks is prosecuted and executed for treason.
Canada, the adviser to the head of government Mr stephen Harper told television, clearly so ironic, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a Drone ."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, door-floor of the US president, Barack Obama, described as a "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr. Assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whether that-CI was responsible of the order given to diplomats, and divulging any recently engaging in espionage activities.
"I do not know exactly why we must pay attention to the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," said Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy, and the interests of the country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The US Government passes now completely to the test the protection of its databases.
According to a press release from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre of the fight protesters-terrorist, has been appointed manager to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for developing "the necessary structural reforms " made necessary after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House was also the desire to examine the means through which the entire administration trade and protects the information.
Further, the US government announced that he wanted to take care of security by dissidents and activists if ever those-CI were threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have done everything possible to get in contact with them," stated the door-floor of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
University the clear outer lens
"Gelato University" Bologna, prepares the confectioners of ice the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation for glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where the ice?
Of the Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier is-à-dire German ice confiseur the somewhat anachronistic, concoct the cream, according to all the rules of Italian art of manufacturing of the ice.
Turbine takes ice cream ice of the window using a chilled spatule, the disposal in gaufre the and then starts to sell.
Knowledge, we do not need to attend Anzola dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But those who wish to know more on the ice, could not avoid "Gelato-University 'of Carpigiani the Italian firm.
Sorbetières of the manufacturer founded university ice in 2003 so that the ice creams of sorties of its machinery meet throughout the Italian high ideals.
The three-day initiation for glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
Are also offered special courses covering the ice chocolate and encompassing several days, and the meetings are organized in the practices glacerie closed.
In full crisis of quarantine, a number of people who dream of a new career, others are likely simply to achieve their yearning on the ice smooth.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, of Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education come to California is a stickler of the Slow Food movement wants to propose to the future, a European product quality in the country of the clear outer lens industry.
Anke of Berlin is as hard as in business management and it wants to, after a few years, taking some thing of singular of this profession challenging for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
Malta and a man from another come Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and Women of Canadian households came because his children love the Italian ice cream.
Master Glacier Luciano Ferrari explained the first participants the characteristics ideal ice perfect.
Is critical not only the right taste, but also flexibility soyeuse and good bones.
However, Luciano not forgotten during training the icing on the cake of the superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best, and then she still retains a massive dose of romanticism. "
The first step in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano pays basic ingredients, including milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers in a large mixing device which boiler all 85 degrees through an electronic programme and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Opens then a tap installed on the machine: It has a basic white cream pasteurized, foundation for all kinds of icy on milk.
The formateur was immediately beset of question: Is it possible to manufacture-ice using only the natural substances without stabilizing?
How may-we give free rein to my pleasure staff of experimentation?
Dr Luciano cautions be misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who speak only of the ice "manufactured from natural ingredients', cannot-be nevertheless used stabilisers: Most often a natural product, by example of bean flour guar achieved from the beans of the guar.
It is of course possible manufacture of ice without use of stabilising, it need only sell it within 24 hours, but if it collapses and the customer croquera nothing other than ice pellets.
Certain modifications to the estate are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavouring.
Luciano the employer finds the difference between the ingredients that one gains fruit or sweets on the shelves of the supermarket.
In addition, there is the powder and pasta.
'Suppliers will try all of you foist dozens of ingredients flavoured. "
"However, you should simply try."
Either in revenue with fruit sorbets to sugar and fruit costs.
Either in ice cream made from the mass of white which adding eggs is a cream and yellow is, when we add the cocoa powder, the basis of all the desserts possible to chocolate.
Now, all of the participants in the course must switch to using machines to ice.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four kinds of ice: Vanilla, chocolate in the Moka and hazelnuts with or without egg in the mass, with more or less of aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of ice in fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More fragrances, more fruit purées: In terms of flavour, it is not absolutely best.
Ice the hazelnuts is not necessarily the taste of meat when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Ice to kiwis, very popular, is manufactured from the group using more fruit and less water and a little less of stabilizing.
'Only a balanced mixture is properly the taste of ice, "says Luciano.
Manufacture of the ice is a calculation: If one uses of puree with a lot of sugar, it must be that the quantity of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
Extra sugar is necessary to the ice in lemon.
Luciano present an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (wine-growers are using to measure the degree to Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the calculations.
Manufacture of the ice is needed, as in the past, all of physical intervention.
This is not just the manufacturing unit automatically the mass of aid.
There is also a system in which we simultaneously fighting a mixture of ice to make it available and at temperatures onctueux reduced negative.
Despite all automatisations, small breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is barbouille of fruit puree from head to foot and, thus, his comrades éclabousse when studies control massive mixing bowl of the escapes.
Owner Luciano is of the opinion that 'an incident that may happen at each course: It is only a matter of time. "
Supervisors in an ambiguous stance
According to some sources, industry is experimenting the cultivation of genetically modified crops has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the expert group Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute to assess the implications of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we we well informed," said Munich Wednesday Mr. Christoph Then, Director Testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the expert group Efsa for GM crops, Mr Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts from Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
Kovacs is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated decisively to the development of test requirements of Efsa for genetically modified crops and is clearly in a state of conflict of interest, according to the critics by Mr. Then.
Requirements developed are verbatim by paragraphs, the positions of the pressure group and relate Ilsi and the marks of the industry which, at the bottom, would be monitored by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of Efsa has recently joined without condition or transitional period the Swiss food group Syngenta. By doing so, It has changed of camp.
There is little time, even the Radio in the Central German (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union monitors and the industrial lobby, which has aroused the suspicions of both German Federal Environment Agency of the European Parliament.
However, Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
Opinion indicates that it exploits all reliable data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of good quality.
It did not prohibit to experts working for the forging of Efsa contact with this business.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that it works for the International Institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi-) based in the United States.
The agency considers itself a neutral forum of experts which owns, among other things, in the area of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks from biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then resent the fact that genetically modified crops are accepted without any test food animals and that are not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, impacts of genetically modified maize due to the scope " affirms Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the GM plant, which makes it difficult to obtain reliable results.
"If we do not research risks, how may-it then discover them?" Wonders Mr Then on a tone accuser.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working in school, Polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region as-United States, and now also in Europe, the sector of the industry are trying increasingly influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
So, it barely exists even researchers who are not connected with the companies.
In the opinion business, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck claims that 'the industry monitoring security research ."
The trace stone
Uli Gsell if obtained, in total roughly 400 per kilo.
Monday after-noon, it was before the station in Stuttgart with a tube to the back.
Had manif.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators came and had started to demolish a large part of the north wing.
Stuttgart the world was no longer the same, thousands of people demonstrated against the project S21, the Transformation of Central Station Stuttgart in a black station which will cost several billion euros.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to the halting of construction work.
Smashed in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Coquillier the Muschelkalk (limestone) to Crailsheim, a large stone and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years residing Ostfildern.
It obtained some of the fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not go."
It said with enthusiasm: "A small rock and cheap, simple and Earth."
It affirming in the cutting at the replay, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what he will make this fragment.
Rocks have the time.
Uli Gsell also.
Traces stones of Stuttgart in a former munitions depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire of stones.
This man of 44 years, makes trade old stones.
It has purchased all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were or if they disappear concassées in discharge" says-it in his office situated in a hut, which was once an outpost.
He says he has been insulted and threatened when, in September, newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But has negotiated for whole days with the opponents of S21.
And he explained that he could not do anything at all to oppose demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
Approximately 200 opponents of the project subsequently S21 prevailed one of Stone parallélépipède an average weight 80 kilos whose value is between 6.5 and 14 euros.
Some custody as memories in hoping also be able to make at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 complete shipments of a truck.
About half is still rich in the forest, the rest having long since sold.
Owners gardens, gardeners paysagistes, Particuliers.
They have travelled anywhere and washed away everything that could go in the boot and the trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart have converted had long "Mäuerle" or limitations of platitudinous-strips of grasses.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular 'said Mr. Rongen.
-" had it not been the political component. "
Entering his car any ground, been round his vast empire of 20 hectares.
Trained as a right that it has abandoned. Later, he undertook to study biology before subsequently to information and ultimately become a carrier.
And an amateur of stones.
It stores 40000 tons.
It hoarding are treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims that it is the largest retailer of old stones.
Réfrène it.
Stones sand carved with art are posed on the snow.
'Formerly, Elles was part of the bridge to Marienbrücke in Dresden. "
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, affirms-it with enthusiasm.
"My preferred stone."
It takes the path upward through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, before, part of the station, to Karlsruhe.
And so.
'Nice travertin. "
The parallélépipède was once part of the gallery of Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow stones and stories the travertin of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the granite rougeâtre from the cathedral, St Blasien, tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen think past the stones were displaced and, carved by hand using palans and of simple carts by horse, it becomes quite respectful.
"This would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in room."
It did not become rich, yet least fabulously wealthy.
But the carrier now employs 14 people; in addition, the tailors of stones, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass souffleur and the gardener have settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," affirms the recycleur of waste.
Shortly, he must travel to Cologne.
Here-low also, there are stones to save.
Fight of talent to conquer the high potential
The front desk knows great pressure.
16 students are lining up to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato and broth whites-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited students design and engineering, in a workshop.
Through a sort of combination of ideas, they should speak profession about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the best brains for more competition and to undertake, as Volkswagen, in a multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit graduates the most gifted in the surroundings as much as possible before they are on the job market and they are courtisés by the other.
Since universities do not issue statements regarding the performance of their students, it is attempting to identify exceptional talent in the context of practical projects and retain.
The second day of the workshop held in the university's technical Brauschweig the automobile group amadoue the talents.
A young lady of service of staff shares the pens, sweets and maps with the logo of Volkswagen.
She spoke of the calendar of vocational courses and jobs students to young talents; she shows ways to access to the group.
Is Nico Saddle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is project leader initiated with Volkswagen.
For him, there is of mutual benefit to the two parties: "students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As the Volkswagen group, he may hear students, looking more carefully the serious candidates and evaluate those in as a collaborator. '
Mr. Chump, Such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the business plan, " asserts Mr. Saddle.
Fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more fraught.
In goods sectors, companies can no longer recruit their co-workers through a sorting on a host of candidates.
But they should tout their reliability and especially woo the workforce highly skilled.
The graduates are mainly engineering sectors who are in a very good position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI guideline, more than 40,000 of engineers have remained unoccupied in October.
And estimates of the VDI guideline, the vacuum on posts of engineer will lengthen again.
Novel Dykta goes hunting talents on behalf of KPMG, the auditing firm, of expertise and accounting advice.
It organizes costly events aimed to the recruitment of talents, such as the race reached cruising KPMG-Race, some kind of rally-paper where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
And the company will send eight promising students next year, so they travel this way-United States.
Participants may secondarily visit subsidiaries of KPMG and knowledge of the business.
Should participate is decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates will fly away for States-US.
Mr. Dykta, means used for the pursuit of potential senior in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the pack through the race."
'For us, a mere cruise was too little "
For the hunter of talent that is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be.
'Until now, we have been in contact with all the people who took part last year in a similar action. "
"Some of them are on the point of completing their education and want to send their requests soon to our business." Argues-it.
Outside direct amadouement out in the campus, the small and medium-sized enterprises are quite traditional in participating to trade fairs where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"We are trying to achieve, the graduates participating in trade fairs."
"For example, the Salon of solar technologies," says Ms Sitha Stübe, director of human resources in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This business in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe has knowledge of the problem related to the notes.
Currently 35 posts are set to contest on the site.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This expensive and time-consuming," ensures-it?
Another means of establishing contact is to move away by university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors showed that the student has the opportunity for training courses or writing his draft end to study at home."
Advertising campaigns expensive were announced among the specialists of solar.
This is why the company is trying to do its advertising highlighting other qualities: Personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," supports Mrs Stübe, chief of staff.
Long ago that the money is no longer the principal role in the search for jobs.
The flexible work, childcare or opportunities for promotion are the other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
Institute is a table of honour of annual German employers.
For this purpose, it asked employees on their level of satisfaction to their work and to its context and look at conditions-frameworks of employees.
The head staff Ms Stübe hope this investment will enhance corporate image among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely above all on external assessments with regard to a potential employer," declares-it.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer in a long-term strategy.
It is advising its customers to show more than authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that primarily means internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make attractive is to go by its own staff," contends-it.
This is known, in the jargon in the sector, the strategy of internal image is-à-dire the creation of the image by the employer in its own strength.
'Employees satisfied form the best messengers. "
When it treats its employees and identify with the company, they do everything alone advertising of their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if you played in an orchestra," declares Mr Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There are no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southern state-@-@ United States, over the years to come.
Washington issued a Prohibition A prohibition equivalent, and thus definitively overturned its original plans.
Same off the Atlantic coast, new boreholes for the moment remain banned.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has made the announcement on Wednesday.
It is exploding, in April, of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is causing this strict prohibition. That-CI will continue at least for the next five years.
Response to this accident which killed 11 workers and led to the greatest environmental disaster-United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and of this sector of activity, had indicated that it was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution and want to reduce the dependence of terror-supporting-à-vis-United States foreign countries regarding the oil supply.
The issue of who was responsible for the devastating oil slick in the Gulf is not, so far, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billions, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must present its conclusions later December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar raised his freezing of drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform.
Following the ruling, various oil groups were immediately submitted claims of new drilling projects.
Together with stricter controls and safety instructions, more stringent Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
Supervisory authority competent, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of far-reaching reforms.
The same time, Mr. Obama has announced the lucrative would remove the tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The players in this industry are now publicly warn that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case so far.
"The goal of the Government is to put the brakes on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the current outcome of a poll carried out in the sector by the audit firm BOD, before the ban of drilling imposed Wednesday.
Of the American Alliance Enery regret the uncertainty which characterises the sector: "Nobody knows what change exactly with regulation."
Investment made in new projects have been deferred until further order, at the expense of growth.
Ogoni the country dries
Water flowing in rivers is huilé brown; it releases a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: Due to a leakage, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country's Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine AkpoBari has a good intention.
'Do you not own ," sends the environmentalist to journalists for the calm:" You today still enough mud of oil before the lens of water. "
The Nigerian of 37 years has tried photographing a young depressed in muddy water up to his chest, as well as fatty drag around it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the flash of colour water arc-in-sky.
I can't see that the ground is full of lakes-brown of crude oil.
On the shore of the River Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom tells of how, once, it was collecting buckets whole prawns by here.
But between-time the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil has bounced a pipeline had exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen capita the small nearby town of Bodo must now swim for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The country's Ogoni in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted in the world.
The full extent of the devastation clear leafing through the mangrove swamps of crossed by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motor vessel is heartrending water chestnut cradingue. Anyone who withdraws any plunges his hand covered with oil.
The mangrove roots of small emerging from the soil as sticks of réglisse. The palm fronds hang themselves sadly palmes leave their isolated.
We look in vain the clouds of birds, as you usually found in wetlands: Once the engine out-board has stopped, a quite bizarre silence befalling this paradise of yesteryear which resembles a-service station by the smell he personally.
"What happens here, this is war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine AkpoBari a quizzical sad: "Our life has been characterised by a constant danger with regard to health. "
Comparison of war is made.
The region which is home to the Ogoni is a battlefield under siege for decades: There are more than 60 years, the first European explorers were entered here; the first resistance was organised in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. that-CI was executed later in 1993, the group had to interrupt its Shell activities of production in that region because those-CI became very dangerous for its employees.
Today yet, the homecoming Ogoni is prohibited in this society, and more than 2 million barrels of oil are pumped daily through more than 5,000 wells drilling and 7000 miles of pipelines in the whole of the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the country's oilfields Ogoni are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in water tréteaux of the steel sculptures as bizarre: It means very affectionately "Christmas tree" the drill holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion up the benchmark.
AkpoBari considers that a leading drilling of this nature be scrappage from time to time in the saddle as a continuous flow of crude oil spilled into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year the amount of oil equivalent to the one that has passed into the sea in the accident the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who must bear responsibility for the continuing environmental pollution? The answer to this question has divided the player.
For group Shell, sabotage and the pipelines siphonage are responsible for over 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, believe the explosions of head of drilling and the oil drilled as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group Shell in Nigeria to enforce safety standards mainly lower than elsewhere in the world: Only the rate of defects of pipes is "still much higher that alleures."
Emerging forms of mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, like a workshop left, full to work and moved to the open air: They are completely naked and covered work up to the neck.
Scintille a fire in one of the many which sometimes linked barrels for pipes, scattered without ground on the site must be répérés: A small illegal refinery.
Is heating the crude oil in the cask for several hours, explained Michael, the team leader.
Initially, petrol by mid-week in a container through the pipes, then, to the tip would conduct drops kerosene fall and be achieved eventually of diesel.
Thus Michael and his four assistants produce daily four drums of Diesel of 300 litres, "we reported 34 million Naira," approximately $22.
Delta residents benefit from chronic shortage of fuel in the world's largest producer of oil in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria have only a single refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than ridiculously low barely 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material.
That-CI is offered through the "patrons" who place the network of oil pipelines in light throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the entire the Niger Delta.
Only a small party completely insignificant of the substance first temporarily stored is unlawfully treated: Organized crime networks which are also among its members about politicians and senior military, give the lion's share into tankers and dumping on the world market.
AkpoBari activist believes that the debate on whether the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the public or in the way of weak production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the fundamentals of the life of fishermen were not if profoundly destroyed, there would be or sabotage, theft and illegal refinery."
But, Entre-time, relations of the Ogoni especially home-equity-à-vis of Shell were so deteriorated that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal from the group '. May-be that operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove best. "
, Michael is becoming nervous.
"It is high time you déguerpissiez" announcement the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal mills are surprised by special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but the most that they offer extra pots-of-wine.
Same soldiers especially from the north of the country will benefit as all Nigerians of the raw material.
'To any point of view, this rotten trick brought down our country well low' regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the reactors of the A380
The A380 is clearly a big security problem.
Examining an aircraft which made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible defect of construction could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
Airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
Beginning November, the passengers on the Airbus company employees Quantas had obviously been up here more likely: In the course of the investigation it conducted, the authority in charge of the Australian air safety found that the reactors of some Airbus aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible default of construction.
The potential breakdown could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue criques and leakage through the connecting of conducting oil-t-on says in a position paper published this Thursday by the administration on the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of reactors'.
Concerned are reactors produced Royce-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft series of the A380.
Airbus's airline Quantas, which had to fly urgent on 4 November in Singapore, is among those-CI.
Australian airline has now begun legal action against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a complaint in a federal court of Australia whose head office is in Sydney, and it give him the chance to take other legal steps against the company.
Steering the Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company will be damage-interests in relation to the incident early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged in a fire in the engine.
In Royce-Royce is the ignition of oil which is at the root of the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced at the world.
Australian investigators announced that other tests relating to security will be made on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Royce-Royce, said the door-floor the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is considered material enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of the plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the jet-propelled a A380.
The aircraft in two floors is the biggest aircraft in the world.

Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking to secede from its logo: According to information reported by the newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could yield up to $500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just beautify the headquarters of the group: The Twin Towers in the Quarter were upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
Now, the financial group is clearly trying to recoup the cost of renovation and it is seeking a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper wrote the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a door-floor.
This door-floor has not outlined the reasons for the sale.
He stated "we check whether it is more useful to occupy us-same buildings or to sell, and to put them in new hire later."
Thus the more major financial institution has already ceded its headquarters, shortly after.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had earned the Twin Towers to a $272 million Euro to holders of equity. She had then rehabilitated.
Transformation aimed at optimizing energy have gobbled up, according to some estimates, roughly 200 million euros.
Sale would, of course, a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the journal, experts in the sector feel the value of towers rebaptized between-time "Tours' green, to approximately 500 million euros.

Thousands mourn the minors who perished.
New-Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been a thought for the children buried who had been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to trace the bodies because the security situation of the affected wells still fragile.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners whose age was between 17 and 62 had been buried under earth.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster area, but had found no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to come down in the mine for security reasons.
After the violent second detonation, the authorities and the administration had deemed the minors had no chance of survival.
Here the bodies could not be increased.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a sun dazzling to Greymouth south of the island New-zélandaise.
They have observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, it was located 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photographs and personal belongings, which include clothing and the planks of surfing, had also their place.
The flags have been placed at half-mast before all public buildings of the country.
Neo-conservatives-New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants in the festival that the New Zealand commemorative-has nurtured the hope that the miners have occurred to the surface.
"But they are never returned to the house."

The Premier and the parents of the victims, a number of foreign diplomats have taken part in the commemorative day.
Minors of southern origin-African and British were also buried at the first blast of the 19 November.

The Police Commissioner Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the temperatures burning inside the mine are starting to decline.
Goes to hell, warrior!
Splatter-the film is a film an artificial?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is exploring the limits the kind old through his film, "Valhalla over Rising 'epic course.
How public the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn-has any thought of turning "Valhalla over Rising '?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) having an eye is taken prisoner; he free itself of his executioner and, with a force nearly supernatural, eliminates his opponents one after the other, and this seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our heroes used brutal methods of murder when he is in a bad mood, he severs the bowel of its enemies without expecting those-CI are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the only one-eyed said no word on his true name. Even the other characters leave by, at most, in one or two sentences a few cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing said anything and festoie in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
This ideal is more mature the film-makers having an interest in and travellings existentialisme excellent.
When a film aimed several groups-targets, it is a pity that those-CI are mutually exclusive.
Winding Refn is the film-maker regarded, since publication of "Pusher," his trilogy on the fierce drug trafficker and full of style, like a Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refused to help a little more humour to the dominant or introduce a little less brutal art and films.
Most supporters of art cinema have to experience the horror to the brain which is spreading around and the intestine.
Films for action fans die of boredom if the one-eyed to embark for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries in a people-smuggling boat headed for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the haze before the crew cannot America and continued to remain silent.
It is not so surprising that "Valhalla over Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and that it only exists in the DVD format.
That is mostly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the picture of an exciting film, time to time, behind a veneer grandiose and bloody.
It is not dialogue in this film, and coherent action, everything is a stopgap, nervous a dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn given barely a moment of relaxation and to slowly cut the throat with frigid images and a soundtrack dismal, but especially with a hatred elusive which comes from the core of the characters.
Only a blond boy who is faithfully with the one-eyed, retains a certain innocence, all others are motivated by anger.
More than any, the one-eyed heroes whose mobile ever known, but that comes from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning into warrior may-be sent of the devil he-same.
There is decay, but may-be also, just for those who are, by any manner, the scrap heap.
"Valhalla over Rising " is a mysterious film can abhor or admire, that purpose was ill-conceived, enthusiasm and the surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious work earthwork
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But that country refused to take a position on this issue, much less submit to the control of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 towards midnight, at least four warplanes F-15 Israeli I attacked some mysterious form Building cube on Syrian territory.
It lies on the banks of the Euphrates River; the larger town nearby to 30 kilometres is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in documents to the IAEA because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built looks-it with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède a rock, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electrical power.
According to a briefing intelligence-United States, the CIA, from end of April 2008, the reactor, known as locality neighbour, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would produce nuclear weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images fuzzy.
Animation across the desktop, it indicated the likely location of each component the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which is a miniature copy-Korean design north of the nuclear plant in Yongbyon.
Increasingly, she presented photographs showing the building located in the vicinity, even the interior of someone-CI.
It seems that the reactor was about to be placed in service, but it was not yet equipped for fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, there is scarcely more information that at the time, and even, in time the mystery grows increasingly.
The former chairman of the States-CPSC George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was confident that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar, but did of peu' indices showing the country was expanding "an active programme of nuclear weapons."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious at this subject and talk only of an "alleged reactor," even though they view the presentation for the CIA as "plausible."
They lack tangible evidence, as well as with the IAEA.
Questioned how it ensures that it has a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat to the United Nations does as a laconic reply in been arguing that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
Syrian the certainly have abducted with haste the rubble the "unused military building" and conducted a systematic levelling out of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by the former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received through a Member State of commercial providers of satellite images showing the moment that followed directly the attaque. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those made by the CIA.
However, the photographs are not available on the market because the anonymous patron can-be Israel, has acquired in exclusivity.
Makes it impossible for the IAEA to establish authenticity of an objective manner.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret atomic programme and that it was not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected that argument after analysis of the particles by classifying it as implausible.
Since this time-here damas refuses any discussion in this regard, just as on the satellite images.
In addition, Syria not allowed monitors to carry out a second inspection on el-Kibar site and refusal access to the ruins of a building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then the Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this matter."
This is as well as the investigation into the case has dragged on since June 2008 without reaching a result and it "is increasingly becoming a major credibility problem of the Agency," recognised a senior Western diplomat in service at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, finally it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
IAEA finds that in order to achieve progress, we must clarify the existence of the other three facilities should have 'a substantive report "with the alleged reactor.
Until now, inspectors have not indicated what facilities it is here, or what is their function or the suspect to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are well-known within IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, the Masyaf Iskandariayah and also the names of cities nearby.
Institute the independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security in Washington) has identified these locations and discovered images a complex satellite nearly Masyaf that would most probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly alongside that-CI; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
Vienna, it is said that the Syrians are concerned that the group of inspection is, in fact, a spy who would be sent on behalf of the States-Uniting by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
To tell the truth, it was information provided by the US secret agents which drew the attention of inspectors.
IAEA has information, including the satellite photos showing that vehicles have been shuttling between all three sites and the Stone parallélépipède transporting substances.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "be used in the production of fuel."
It had "no indications regarding sensitive activities' as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This reactor is certainly working through not enriched uranium.
However, there is to the rigour of plausible assumptions regarding the following basic questions: Where should have come where and uranium would-it separated later plutonium necessary for a bomb.
It is not known if the debris, which could hide traces of high value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks of land will disappear, no one will have information on place of storage from the rubble.
To the IAEA, it is unlikely Syria did review in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres to el-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if it can agree the storage of radioactive waste.
Analysing recent satellite pictures on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley established a link between those-CI and the reactor in question.
Of satellite pictures show, however, Syria has undertaken work in the three locations suspects and moved huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped remove suspicions.
As it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months to develop a plan for inspections to perform This plan should allow Syria to preserve any possible military secrets. Only time invested shows what great interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
There are a year, although Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be used in this case, contends, for instance, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States speaks-past few months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful ways which the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA chief, Yukiya Amano, who has had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to the future," but it is still reluctant.
This way involves a huge risk: For one thing, it requires a majority to the IAEA Board of Governors, and a good many of the 35 countries that are represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
The other hand, as the diplomat who gives réflechir: "With that serve-it, if in the end they did not find anything"
Love in wartime
It goes badly since Angelina Jolie has made his debut in the summer as a film director.
She wrote the script she-same: This is a love story between a woman originally from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Nobody knows nothing more about this story, but that is enough to provoke unrest.
A persistent rumour said that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love of his Serbian butcher for the war in Yugoslavia.
Federations of Bosnian women immediately protested; in response, some film sequences in Sarajevo were displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Between-time, the film was made in Hungary, but the post-mortem-production, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a journal Bosnian-wide Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Lovely is-even goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago, she proposed these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but gasoil-those have declined the offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There were no stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie said long enough on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended that the United Nations high commission to withdraw as the goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what sort of scenario Jolie has-they written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had received copies of the script, after some hesitations granted permission set in Sarajevo, but we do not know why it is subsequently not come despite this authorisation.
The young author ensures she-even it does not pursue political goals with his film, that this is a lot of effort that it was aware of the Yugoslav conflicts. She says that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and provide an opportunity for all parties involved.
It remains vague about the content.
A second of the film synopsis travels on the Net, it is quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war and it will meet again when the woman, a Muslim Bosniak, is deported within the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
What is, after all, a big difference with the version "a rape victim if amourache of his executioner."
Film of Jolie had begun well before the war, of course.
Pressure on it, thus expressed Jolie, is "unfair and based on information erronnées."
Now only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: By illegally this scenario in the Net, as many others before.
Learn we!

If these predictions are realised, this will be a flow of emigration comparable to that Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have had great ease, the grief takes now the place.
The economic crisis, however, especially young people, well trained, who have only known so far that moments of happiness.

The Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, like that private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern that unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than States-US in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the poll has been taken regularly since 1995, it tracks the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two elements related in the results of the poll this year, conducted in September and early October.
The first is relatively sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen significantly in several countries on the periphery of the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
By example in Peru, where economic growth averaging 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy rose of a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, when the economy rebounded after suffering a sharp fall in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region they were satisfied with the way democracy to their countries works in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a large increase on the 25 per cent last year (chart 3).
Some 34% said they had trust in Parliament in their countries and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but rising sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
10 years, economic problems in Latin America, shook support for democracy.
Though it has endured during the global financial crisis, that is certainly due to the fact that many countries have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
Addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America had reported this week that the proportion of Latino-Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again declined this year, with 32 per cent.)
But the humour varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
Good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected by a widely shared sense progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crime has increased.
Only for the second time since the poll began that more respondents through the whole of Latin America cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their countries (see table 5).
Approximately 31% say they-same or a of their son had been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is lower than the 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise and market economics: Some 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, against 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Approximately 58 per cent believe that a market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47 per cent last year.
Fact interesting, 62 per cent of respondents in Venezuela are of this view (and 80% support private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the largest crowd in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of respondents, against 18 per cent last year), followed by the United states- (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, down 11 per cent since last year).
-but the United States are seen as the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and throughout much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Vote a blemished
Nobody expected to be general election means perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than outsiders who wanted to help the stricken country and mired in fear.
It has presented of ballot boxes and a new election, in the voting slips scattered goutières, vote vandalism and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who have been displaced after the earthquake in January, instead roamed in the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually had to abandon.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged pet, denunciation of the fraud and have called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, considers the event as "a pretty good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "not believe that those irregularities, as serious are-they, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are overdue to René Préval, outgoing President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
Expected the second round is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has made little or no visible support among the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second Toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging and more than 1 million to the earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that the participation would be.
Precisely many haitïens wanted to vote but have been prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 passes necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a government popular and legitimate as an important step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, the Haitians are doing them-same.
Tip towards the centre
Weeks after they become suddenly a widow, and Cristina Fernandez, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy from the public has improved his approval rate of 20 points, to more than 50 percent; this is the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet transform that into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year might depend on the choice of Ms Fernández, visibly in mourning that she would abandon or not the intransigence of her deceased husband, former political partner and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs are still confused.
Mr Kirchner, who has continued to handle economic policy, even after his wife to succeed him as President, was wont develop budgets that under-felt tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
Has enabled the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
The government of Mrs Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen in disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have rallied to Ms Fernández.
After the sessions but chaotic (where an MP was punched in the face one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the chairman yet greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy overheated widely: It is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many estimates private and the wage demands of the unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than on the control of inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official statistics on inflation.
Ms. Fernández may-it now moderating these policies?
It has called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit the pay increases next year to 18%.
Economics had been stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
-this may be the reason why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to re-establish financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who refused a previous restructuring forced debt on which Argentina had not paid its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister for the Economy, said that the fund would provide "technical assistance " to design a new national index of consumer prices; what seems like a prelude sanitation INDEC.
It was not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to stay in politics at-beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer on its side.
If it does so, it needs to win the support of the middle class, including the exalted kirchnerisme is very.
When the Argentines will be back from their summer holidays on Mars, the wave of sympathy for reflué it will.
If she is to win another election, it would have to decide to repudiate or not, without the noise, many policies of her husband.
Half-two cheers for China
Taiwanese voters are as geared towards a closer union with the continent.
That is-Taiwan think of his big brother located on the other side of the straits?
Over 7.5 million voters submitted on 27 November, which is 70 per cent of those eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a comprehensive assessment of the President Ma Ying Jeou-.
Mr. Ma is-even become a substitute for the feelings from mainland, having forged links innovative affairs, including a free-trade pact in part, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five local authorities, it has failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the democrat-Progressive Party (DPP), who has been tipped to full independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all the votes to the KMT of 45 per cent.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of the vote for his party has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the LCP has drawn voters, even with the KMT in the councils.
The event has revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwan elections, including lorries at shadow campaign flags of collection of mass with girls which danced in place minimal.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT and has done a tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
One man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, the wounding and killing a passer-by.
Oddly, it has not been determined if the gunman wanted to do harm to Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an effect on the election with the leader doubt on the LCP and turning voters to the KMT.
May-be that the biggest winner in the elections was China.
It was striking how the mainland she-same was absent.
Instead, the candidates with pay-for-performance plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan is typically its de facto independence and dislikes the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid of parade its ties with the government in Beijing.
CI-but this time, the DPP also abstained to fan feel anti--Chinese.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese firms are essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, claimed a confirmation for whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
One can expect that the government in Beijing continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to mistaken Taiwan back to the fold.
China lost no time to send a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on the protection and investment cooperation.
Yes, she would also like to see political integration; but let us start at the beginning.
Better wait until after the presidential election of 2012.
The LCP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years, it was bad: His former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, it was a provocateur in favour of independence explicit.
But a new generation of moderate has seen the light of day under the guidance of Ms. Tsai and the PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the presidency of the DPP as Su Tseng-chang, who has served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he, too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has announced plans to a panel of experts for act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can be held without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has a "trustworthy alternative" over the hasty approach of Mr. Ma on China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidates from the PDP have obtained better results if they had stressed that Taiwan is a separate country.
He has even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to seek the presidency.
Same without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the LCP would find it difficult to choose between its candidates.
That the KMT is introspection self-evident-same.
Assessments of Mr. Ma have been low, and despite a staggering economic growth, the KMT candidate did not want to campaign with him.
Its popularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A door-floor KMT said that his office as well as the local branches will be redesigned.
PDP's good results suggest that support of Taiwan for the rapprochement should be limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments the Grammy Awards: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a chairman, people are obliged to be aware.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz singer bassiste and 26-year-old picked by President Obama to take place during his ceremony of the Nobel Peace Price in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination wide-ranging in the category of 'best new artist.
Recital that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza ," the appointment is somewhat mysterious, but it is consistent with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not emerge more of three albums before recording; what" establishes the public identity of that artist. "
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," has certainly marked a step forward, and given his slight vocal style, his clever hands pop and "Funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointillée to Spalding from the brilliant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters of Grammy Awards taking into account production in this jazz category in recent years.

Draft the mosque of Temecula wins the approval of the planning committee.
A proposed mosque in Temecula had received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project, arguing that it was promoting both the terrorism that congestion of traffic.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious centre comply with local laws and that it will be impressive esthétiquement.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahá'ís, you say," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
'This shows that justice prevailed. "
'Opposition is really minimal ," has-it added.
They have just of votes, very strong. "
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people deciding for or against the centre, to speaking time roughly equally divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
'It is a different planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand. "
'America has fallen. "
Islamic centres planned have also prompted protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, the scene of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of around 135 families co-exists without incident in the County of Riverside for years but they wanted a larger space and better that the warehouse that she has rented on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque to 24,943 square feet to the Mediterranean style architecture would comprise two minarets and is said to be 43 feet high.
It would be a site of 4.32 hectares Nicolas on the road about two miles east of the Lycée Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this project in the city council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The strange discovery of bacteria that can use arsenic as one its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and may-be-beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities to-beyond the major components, which were considered essential.
"This body has a dual capability."
"It can be developed with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even if it is not a form of life really 'foreign', explained Paul Davies C. W. of the University of the State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major components have long been considered essential for life: Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"I wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth-because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life resembles, Anbar said.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement for a press conference to discuss the matter, which has not disclosed the details of the goldmine, has generated speculation spread on the Internet that the report might disclose the discovery of a lifetime extraterrestre.
Has not been the case.
Discovery shows that in other environments, they might be able to use other features to actuate biochemistry and that the whole "Standard" elements, that we are absolutely necessary for life could not be fixed, "commented Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Scientific research global and spacial, the Open University, in Milton Keynes, Kingdom-Uni.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a casual discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Institute Astrologie NASA, who led the study, has chosen the Mono Lake because it provides high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar; thus, it was speculated that a microbe briefing the two substances might be able to replace one with the other.
'Arsenic is toxic chemical mainly because his behaviour is really similar to the phosphorus. "
"As a result, the agencies have difficulty determining these elements separately."
'But arsenic is sufficiently different for that it does not work exactly as phosphorus; it got inside and, to some extent, the gum of the biochemical machinery, "said Anbar.
Researchers have collected bacteria known as 1 GFAJ-and have exposed to increased concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with the arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life that use arsenic can occur naturally or elsewhere on Earth, or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorous, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it can walk.
Arsenic was more frequent early in the existence of the earth, said-it; so, researchers have speculated that the first forms of life could use it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe-Simon.
Research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The two remaining dogs exhibit stolen have been recovered Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four stolen from outside a motel to Bellflower were retrieved, the sheriffs in Los Angeles County have anoncé Thursday.

They have been returned to their rightful owners. "
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs were found in which district and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We do not want to say ', Whitmore has-it said.
"We are following orders."
Owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and Peek David, were unable to be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday after-noon with their two Akitas in a sanctuary for animals of county to Downey.
The sheriff's deputies have recovered the van and the two dogs separately to Compton.
Akitas the - Trace, a male about 3 years, and Didi, a female of 10 months, were unharmed, the authorities have announced.
Bunny and Peter but the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of a Japanese dog, were missing until they were discovered on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this week-end in the framework of national championat "AKC / Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they intended to present Trace.
Other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions other tests planned in the days prior to the exhibit "AKC / Eukanuba," said Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the rulings the travelling exhibition of almost one month of the canine couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often remain in the motels garent and their van outside, right beside the window of their room.
They have taken three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton épagneul - who stayed with them in the chamber of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with more thick fur, in the van where there would be more expense.
They have somewhat open the windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van to 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek has said that they would offer a reward to any person that could lead the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
Lion is ready to be new, the restructuring GMMs waiting more that the final go-ahead of the court-martial
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, GMMs has finally been given the green light to start again from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, has been officially hired Thursday the plan "pre--packed" by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment business, with 86 years of existence, to focus on the production and distribution of films and TV programmes.
With the decision on Thursday, that the plan meets the requirements of bankruptcy code-United States, most are no legal obstacles remain before GMM to to stay afloat under the tutorship of founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors of which studio will be a lighter.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 on 400 at the beginning.
GMMs really will not emerge from Chapter 11, as JPMorgan Chase has not entered into a credit facility of $500 million provided to finance the new operations and GMM productions.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which faced-even $75 million, and it should be funded in the mi-December.
The process of restructuring the studio started in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. has been engaged to advise the management about how to put its finances since it did not have the means of paying interests amounted to $300 million per year.
During the month of August, the general manager, in Harry, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in reorganization known for her work among Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of the GMM and meet more than 140 creditors of the studio have taken much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, by the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none of them was willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more whose creditors were seeking.
The spring of this year, that had to be re-run GMMs even though the team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreement and internal debates, has finally been approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs fate officially of bankruptcy in the following weeks, the firms and Moelis Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already reached $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Business to Cooper, who have collected $375,000 per month for their direction of the company, will receive a bonus "to success" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account re-launch the GMM, which has lifted only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight who were to film from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be done by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of the debt of the GMM, has tried to achieve a merging of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where it is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies had not reached an agreement.
Toys Tech to keep your budget in balance presents
Although the main candidate for the pawn on more wonderful this year be the IPAD, follow-up may-be, by a video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a hole in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX to $99 and a Kinect is the same price that cords 10 jumping classic pearls, or approximately 48 boxes-Play Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, when there are usually fewer new toys linked to web sites, two of the best-known, Webkinz and Club Penguin, had more offers.
And toys to button batteries are on the rise, as well as toys to rechargeable batteries.
A few recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless specified otherwise.)

If you buy several, they sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you begin to support, you can no more stop you.
To combine songs to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Based on the technology of the Elmo Live last year, dolls animatronique of 14 inches plays games to turn as Simon Says and can dance make the Moon through its innovative articulated feet with blocking of wheels.

Mobigo of the VTech ($60, in the 3 to 8 years old) was the least expensive and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games does not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for the 3 in 12 years), it is the first major revision of Leapster range, screen with a more recent and more lights.
Any version is compatible with the old cartridges.
IXL the Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) type of system used iTunes to provide games and e-books and has an SD card entry for that display photos of family.

Tang Shenbin arpentait a place of the city as a sergeant to the urban training inspectors severely burdens its nerve, in whispers by issuing orders with a military authority.
It wanted that the female members of chengguan - responsible cars in China, feared and despised for their suppression arbitrary and their penchant for violence - conveys a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Hold-you right!"
'Be perçantes! "
Show-their, said-it, "what the nice girls!"
Four girls having barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and jeans identical olive colour, figeaient-à-vous the guard.
Four pairs of black footwear to Achilles, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly case the top of hair restrained by a node struck out in blue and white.
"I personally believe that they have a seemingly average, 'said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
'Models are nice. "
More of a government tried to refresh the image of the city inspectors to China.
A city has required that all new recruits have a diploma of study.
Guangdong Province has exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a rookie himself-saying more engaging.
Wuhan in Central China, replacing lower-the-eyes by the strong-arm: In 2009, a report indicated that 50 senior officers had surrounded a trolley to snack uncontrollable by launching black eyes firmly-for half an hour, until the colporteur is packing up his business and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a major operation of image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police urban of 13 women, specially chosen for their looks, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a more sweet dégrossie, more feminine.
Unfortunately even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties to eye-catching Brigade on this underground urban China
And for, the critics will say.
Contrary to the police, those agents are not authorized to enforce the municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other sanctions.
But Chinese media portray the new a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei was beaten to death a observer after he used his mobile phone to film the now disperse a protest against a waste dump.
Last year a Training manual for the inspectors in Beijing, supplanted and put online, outlined how defeat effectively the offenders without any blood.
This year to Shanghai, a colporteur of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
Of violence permeated a video game, available by downloading online, shows Chinese inspectors trained the onslaught of street traders.
'Chengguan marked the government ," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth controversy on the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real thorough cleaning."
Sceptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial published in The Beijing Evening News, was asked if women have real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants, aged between 18 to 22 years, to have a nice shape and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They should be larger than the average, or 1.6 meters, or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years is compulsory.
Officers have said that the work was physically too inconvenient for women over 25 years.
"It is their reputation that is important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government Web site.
"First, the qualities their external candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, the features of the face, etc '
Then come the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Women of the Chengguan are as Dewar to flowers has-it said, adding: "in addition to being of Dewar, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management office of the District of the city, do not agree with this description.
But noted that the demands on the job were the standard feature in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
That is the case the exigeance order of the features of the face.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Yes, people with disabilities or who are disfigured as a result should not apply.
"We cannot allow a person which box or a future bossu serve here," said Mr Zheng.
"It would not give a good picture. "
Liu Yi, who patrol the place Baoguang near a monastery, was aged 22 and cheeks pommelées with finely with a mouth.
It does not see the development of her appearance as sexist'at-she said.
'Believe-you that I have the air in this sexy uniform? "Has-they requested with a disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague to fossettes aged 21, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose in what their mandate is limited, saying-they, because they have more large career ambitions than just drive sellers in alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen vendors rapidly moving on foot or on bike, trying to sell the most feasible of bread rolls or bowls of tofu before taking the flight.
"Employer Wang, you should leave."
"We have already said several times!," said Mrs Xu while a seller has fled on foot, leaving his bicycle cart-temporarily to noodles.
Agents describe their functions rather as monotonous that difficult.
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female workers do not have the power to their male counterparts did confiscate property sellers.
They may threaten to report violators to their superiors male.
That tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread false rumours in which the agents the chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of chengguan have been wounded, 14 government vehicles were overturned and set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two away Baoguang the quiet place, where the female officers patrolled this morning-here, more than 50 people have gathered at the corner.
Agents confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired on the sidewalk instead in a shop, as the imposing regulation.
The owner of a motorcycle shouted to the scandal.
A tug-of-war to 15 minutes followed before police officers, on the face of humanity, have paved a path with kink to their vehicle and are left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years ago, a male team committed to the coordinator, remained behind, its white badge back to hide its behalf.
As the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - play purely a support role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain an image to a gang.
Sometimes, we are fighting words. "
"Sometimes we struggle physically," said Mr Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public who begins."
Prosecutors do not Senator Ensign inculperont
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice has dismissed the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, from a case on an assistant an old campaign and in its efforts to secure a lobbying work for the husband of the woman have anoncé Wednesday, lawyers for Senator.
The decision brings to a close the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, Republican of Nevada who was seen as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and jeopardized his career.
Mr Ensign's office said that he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation a year ago.
Senator could still be at risk of disciplinary action taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign has said that the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was more often the subject of the investigation and that it had no intention of maintaining of any accusation against him in this case."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Ministry, where there was significant evidence showing that Mr. Ensign reportedly conspired to violate a criminal prohibition on federal lobbying.
Interviews, I-O-e-mails and other documents, first submitted in October 2009 in the New York Times, reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who had one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to buy the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in the case of Senator with it.
Mrs Hampton once served as a treasurer at a campaign to Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political backers to find work for Mr. Hampton, and secondly, he has defended their rights after they have incurred Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for one year by law to lobby their former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the ban so-called revolving door lobbying.
According to the evidence, which has been made public, "there appears to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and material breach of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the Government.
Although Judge the Ministry has refused to explain the reasoning that had led to the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the ministry appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks cashed high-level by the Public Integrity section, including the decision last year to abandon the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct from prosecution.
Federal prosecutors were clearly afraid of taking up arms, said Melanie in, the director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a human rights group which has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
'This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them, "she added.
Paul Coggins, lead counsel of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from an attorney from the Justice Ministry and a monitoring the next day, saying that the department was not trying the charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that Senator, as its Bureau the reaffirmed Wednesday, in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments it had made to the public prosecution service.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice it, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," at-it said.
Last month, the Federal Commission of Elections has decided to abandon an investigation following a complaint by the independent ethics group, supporting that payment of 96.000 $by parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violate federal election law.
The electoral commission said that it was not sufficient evidence to prove that the money is anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major company which has long supported the Nevada Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find work lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company was hosting Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told her that he 'martelait "the Ministry of Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer in Nevada, and Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transport to fix a meeting on behalf of the airline having hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When news of the affair surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and has resigned from his position for fourth among Republican leader in the Senate.
Having kept a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of a criminal investigation, its door-floor, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow early example of the Department of Justice and an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his tireless work on behalf of the people of Nevada, said-it.
The call to Cheshire will expose Twitter
-half a dozen of them were being lectured to far in the back rows of the courtroom.
They sent all the minutes reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
Eventually the defence said there were more than 140,000 messages on the case of rape and children committed to their bed in a house which was set on fire.
Thursday the trial largely followed of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to a formal end where the judge impose the death penalty, which was accepted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes had already file elements which outlines the arguments to the court of appeal, to fill the courts for years.
This is provocative, it is that of the intense media coverage of the trial, as well as widespread use and scope by journalists of Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere ," a saturation if widespread and hair-trigger incendiary with details that the jury was improperly influenced by the feelings of the public.
Request might push the appeal judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules into the courtroom.
"I experienced it at the trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom undermine the rights of individuals to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, head lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, their answers has rejected the demands in the judgement last week, complaining that the media were "carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been moderated by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of Appeal recognized for decades that the media coverage of high-profile cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the conviction-of osteopaths a Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the assassination of his wife, contending in its decision that there was an "atmosphere of Carnival the trial" because of the media.
Crime is seen by some to have been the inspiration for the television programme and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that courts of appeal presented for review a half-century later, the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules would be needed to manage the media of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and has writing a report that it was arbitrarily implemented.
Professor Donohue asserts that some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instantaneous communication from courtrooms may allow fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is just one of many described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, and which delays the execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue has refused to allow them to test the reaction of potential jurors by showing them pictures of gruesome crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors have said they have been horrified by the photographs of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years ago.
Defence lawyers allege that they also are challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge wrongly deported one juror, was critical to the prosecutors, and that he was improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual step of leading the jury to deliberate in a week-weekends.
Jurors have not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effects of the intense media coverage the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge against the ruling, made last month, that the case dominated the media landscape in Connecticut and it was discussed during the election campaign by the gubernatorial and Senate-United States.
They maintained that the IT media continuing to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily scramble of tweets of media cameras and reporters in front of the palace of justice," wrote lawyers, "resembled nothing was seen before here in New Haven, and may-be the same at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, journalists said that the contention that the new flash were more incendiary that the reported recovered more slowly, was a view which would impoverish luddiste policy governing court coverage in future proceedings.
But some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts étaitent often attracted by the arguments that social change and technology required an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insisted on that claim.
In their dossier, they make a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 who had overthrown the conviction of Dr Sheppard as a result of media coverage of the trial and they said they invoqueraient the need for new rules for the new media.
"This affair ," wrote-they," represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Civility may-it bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by mutual recrimination and the negativity, a modicum of civility broke out to Washington this week.
Comes-it for a sign before-runner of genuine bipartisan co-operation towards the front or a time foolish before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the main issues that must be dealt with during the session of the "lame duck."
But obviously there has at least been a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties as well as recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode in which each camp wanted to score ratings points. empty partisan point.
The public meeting on Wednesday, the Committee on the president's deficit has been equally civilized, despite political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has established a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but who, nevertheless, still divides members.
That is barely sufficient to declare a new era of cooperation is coming.
The two parties are now in a period testing and test in order to obtain evidence of cooperation and compromise, while estimating the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
Therefore the meeting of Tuesday, and the subsequent comments was unveiled some minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too radical to suggest a rapid change of climate that has existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or the rights, both parties remain at miles of distance.
Yet the election of November had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed about the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
Elections raise passions partisan and, secondly, they estomptent.
Is good. "
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck," the Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
The two sides to find a way to preserve some or all, of a permanent or temporary basis.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits would-what because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimistic about a possible agreement on issues raised at the session on the "lame duck," with ratification of the pact "New START '.
But William Galston put it, of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session 'blade duck' ménera not necessarily better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, said-it, a time of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
'Once things that have to be done are, the psychology in the short term will be in one of the confrontations, was-it said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to real cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a meadow-spectacle or a shadow-boxing from the main event of 2012, at-he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and with voters attending the tea which contributed to its creation.
Republican leaders, however, are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they have to try to live up to their promises to reduce government spending and repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit which include reform of the tax code and to increase some taxes, raise the retirement age and reduce costs.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine, Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and under them-same, against deficits on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, which consists of 18 members and present their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The strongest resistance persists among the elected representatives of the group; suggesting that there is on tax issues, at least today, little cause or willingness to compromise.
Galston put it two stages in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year as fighting supporters, given that Republicans assail Obama on budget, tax and health care; only to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of the change?
The public.
It is amply demonstrated that despite partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a state of limbo as 1995, then both parties will be watching carefully the reaction of the public.
That will be judged in loss should change course and find compromises.
But it would be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1980s and it seems to be more ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to an election most consistent in 2012.
In light of this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them.
American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy " and pushed until Kremlin some pots-of-wine and money of protection it collects, said the Embassy of States-US Russia in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service of making massive racketeering that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, has-it said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share while money snakes towards the top of the scale.
Of the note, which was sent out to Washington under the name of The Ambassador John Beyrle, was launched Wednesday by Wikileaks on its web site.
Note is based on sources whose names have been cleared up.
It was drafted when Yuri Luzhkov was still Mayor of Moscow; and it is in large part held accountable for corruption.
It was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little trace for cleaning.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction business, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and it won several libel on these charges.
In September, also said a Russian television station, when he was interviewed in a film suggesting he was corrupt: "This is crazy, it is to build, this is nonsense."
Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; depending on the poll.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a account-rendered Embassy; and it is incredible to imagine that this would be for the diplomats to a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to appoint 'dysfunctional "and to claim that the government operated more as a kleptocracy that a government," according to the notes of the Embassy.
"Criminal elements enjoy" Krysha " (the word used in the criminal world to / the Mafia which literally means' roof 'or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
'Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow the criminal world. "
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are the second level."
'Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level. "
"It is a system which is inefficient in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report said that the FSB has earned money of the largest companies and the police would target small.
A source, has-it said, "that the owners of business in Moscow included that it was preferable to obtain protection MVD and FSB (rather than groups of organised crime), because they have more weapons, more money and more power than the criminals groups but they are also protected by the law."
"That is the reason for the request for protection by the criminal gangs is not so high."
The note said that, although the collection money extended, the protection she-same may be unequal; even those who are paying are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shut under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly addressed the fight against corruption, but he has admitted the little progress.
Note of the Embassy transmits of Auditors-rendered reports men who bring suitcases, probably met of money, so the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev is bureaucrats," said in an recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, head of the 'think tank Indem' of Moscow.
"But it is a part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it is not in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, no separation of powers has-it said, the corruption is inevitable.
With the Indem, costs of corruption amount, to the scale of Russia as a whole, to more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent poll on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are categorised the least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the notes to the US embassy, was achieved only yesterday, in the late evening, Moscow time, certainty remuera of discontent within the Russian Government; although Luzhkov to be blamed to some extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to prove that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin has speculated that those documents WikiLeaks could be a manufacturing and has reacted angrily to what diplomats from the United States have disclosed-calling Medvedev closer in Batman and Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that he is of our interaction an important factor in domestic politics in this country, said-it.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to the ethos."
Former fighters of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a poorly illuminated with walls in concrete bring of poor quality, the head of school of Anlong Veng mentioned the man who had constructed, the last head of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he worried about his people ', stated Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander, remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold north-west of Cambodia, where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of ex-soldiers of the organization are still living today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered in government, the loyalty is finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation has enabled victims to deal publicly to people who have participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school that, for the first time, is the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian tribunal, jointly run with the United Nations, made its first award for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, in condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek IEV, better known as' Duch '.
Before this development of the situation, the anxiety has increased from former fighters of the Khmer Rouge to Anlong Veng; mystifying reconciliation efforts and their wills to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent body that conducts research on the system.
'For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil. "
'The situation creates divisions within families. "
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, around 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its military have fled to the border from Cambodia with Thailand.
Here, they launched an insurgency that has lasted until the last movements go in December 1998.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary headed the guerrilla warfare of their base in the mountains of the West and in the jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement brokered by the United Nations has led to the first democratic elections in the country in 1993, major groups of combatants Khmer Rouge began to defection to the government, with the culminating capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held top, has been captured by the government forces in 1999 in the Dangrek mountains near.
He died in a Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk in squalor, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and there are those who are still nostalgic of the movement.
Although few officers of the elite the Khmer Rouge have kept their leadership posts in local exchange to have laid down their arms, it was farmers not qualified the low rank and file.
"These people have been very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including at Anlong Veng.
"They imbibés ideology agrarian utopian of the regime."
They have been brought up in an environment in which to do business is an alien concept. "
Sor Lim, aged 55 years, who joined the Khmer Rouge as teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
'Life under the Khmer Rouge was good ," has-it said.
'Ta Mok feeds everyone. "
But now, the life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The Court should, at the beginning of next year, launch the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another Khmer Rouge former minister.
The Court's mandate is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said if it continued at-beyond these four cases.
More may be needed to calm fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation are profit-based Im Chaem, aged 64 years, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that it had supervised the building of the dam from Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers reportedly died.
Recently at a torrid evening, Im Chaem was working on the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss of its past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court the summoned, said-it, she refused to go there.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," at-she said.
'If there are more charges, there will be war. "
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had defected from the Khmer Rouge, in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would happen if the court continued several suspects; although the experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past, at-he said.
But confront the past is all that the Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to connect the pieces broken, said-it.
"We need to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, comprising 75 pages."
It has distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, to the high school, which contained fewer four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite links of the city on a diet.
Touch Valeak, age 19, a student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new handbook was helping students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," said-it.
'Are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue. "
Such resistance passed the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.

Belarus agreed to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium.
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would get rid of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; the decision is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials worldwide
Agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the foreign minister of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in the sidelines of a security summit.
The US Government had tried for years to persuade the Belarus to give up highly-enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But American officials have told the Washington Post that some operations classified were realized with Belarus in the last two months £187 to eliminate weapons-grade uranium from a research centre, of Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about £500, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations convened at the initiative of Obama; when Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the ex-Soviet republic in the wake of the summit, in 2012.
"I'm very fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the summit on nuclear security summit in 2012 of nuclear security."
"I am proof that this process works," stated Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton has called the agreement "very significant step, important" produced by Belarus.
Obama has pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on nuclear safety of Obama, President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, said that the nation would agree not ever to its uranium.
'We kept highly enriched uranium, of hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially of the WGU and low enriched uranium ," said even Mr Lukashenko.
"Is our product... We are not going to manufacture of dirty bombs, and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We are going to use for research purposes, this is everything."
Belarus-United States is closer to a few months; however, by demonstrating an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium of Belarus in October, has been especially complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, reported officials.
It was loaded onto a special train that has travelled more than 1,300 miles up to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials have indicated.
The second operation was completed Monday and has been carried out by air, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace of research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
'Careful coordination and organization have been implemented to enhance confidence "; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy dedicated in the Reducing Threaten the World.
According to estimates from the Centre for Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States are strained-for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko on Human Rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming progress on those issues of global security, the United States and Belarus-acknowledged greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential for improving bilateral relations; and critical to the progress of the country and its citizens," has-they said.
The government has any objection to CIA flights
The government has raised no objection to CIA flights with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, in a telegram of the ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is shown by documents (filtered) cables by Wikileaks in daily newspaper El Pais, adding that the first vice-chairman of the Government of that time here-, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Executive is informed Spanish for 'pouvoir' show they held adequate surveillance on foreigners across Spain ."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former northern-American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The vice-chairman acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero outside-game 'and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega noted that Spain has no objection regarding flights of intelligence above of the Spanish territory."
'They want to just be informed " to avoid being "taken by surprise," describes Aguirre in a cable.
Ministry Externe to the incumbent of this epoch-, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, said the Spanish ambassador that the Executive "wanted to give this matter on looming lowest possible, although, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
To its round, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González sent to the Embassy the fact that he will not block the initiative the judge seeking the declassification of secret documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain evidence incriminating, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having talked with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown when even their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors' more for information déclassifiée of CNI o of the Defense Ministry.
"This co-ordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts for manoeuvre if quietly between the Governments' regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch meeting between the ambassador of the United States, and the Minister of Internes, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, gasoil-him commented that 'even though Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence, and will do what they consider adequate', he had instructed his staff "to refrain the comments of an overheated rhetoric, by attempting rebaisser the temperature."
Ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP in this case.
"despite his general direction pro-American, our experiment suggests that PP certainly will be any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be construed as possible human rights violations, while those revelations-there have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," stated-it.

Members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC in lose 9
With the results from 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the of Lérida municipes, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and Members recorded in the latest autonomous elections the PP Catalan has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, that the outlook is more positive because the number of votes that the training received in those double comices normally that she receives in Catalan.
Thus obtained 610.473 Catalan popular votes for the overall 2008, as the autonomous of 2006, they had achieved 316.222.
Sunday past, the CPP has obtained 384.091 votes.
If you maintain this upward trend, while embezzlement of votes to the SGP and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, while there would be a general election, the CPP could past 8 to 12 MEPs in the Congress while CiU in four would also (it now has 10) and SGP loses no more or less than nine (he was 25).
These Catalan calcules would notice that the place is fundamental for PP and coal-mining.
Analysis of popular, ERC would lose an MP - he has three now - during that COLI would keep one or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the more doing next-you be held in May 2011 for municipal comices, where the popularity may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their follow-on at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, an administrations indulging the higher budget - 661 million euros in 2011-.
Both nationalists as popular are that SPG could lose mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Girona Lérida and, where the Socialists would the majority either the possibility to use their traditional partners, ERC and COLI.
Taking into account Republican debacle, it would be fanciful that this training losing its representation in the mayoralty of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% for votes-.
PP has increased its number of votes in four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in capital of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before current socialist Mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
To Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference 500 votes from SGP, whose Mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been on several occasions.
The strife has registered the progress in other important municipes as Badalona, Reus Castelldefels or.
Now, the PP is present in 34 governments to Catalonia and aspires to lists up in a number of locations.
Catalan the cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Other seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand that has been there three
The seven Pakistani and the Niger held by agents of the police station of the Police General Information Barcelona formed a jihadist cell which, led in Thailand, expedited passports to the various groups Al Qaeda, among which "Les Tigers for the Earth Liberation Tamil" (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba " (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks which have caused death 106 people in 2008.
MPW Internes of gave great importance to these investigations, to the point to ensure that with "Operation Kampai 'has' been debilitated" the falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years that it was active in Catalonia has been sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups who integrate the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda for its' combatants' to cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
Cell dismantled is the only that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, which is why the investigations have participated, in Thai share of services, other European police units, which is why within the European Union there could be subsequent days of similar coups to those recorded the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani was detainee Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand was held another, with the arrest of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thailand Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They was those who led since Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
Catalan the network - part of which has been minted in 2009 - stealing mainly tourists passports that satisfied the conditions marked by the named "World Islamic Front."
Is-say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a period of several years and without visas estampées.
Researchers stress that so far it has not found anything that connects inmates in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups of receivers passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless he should remember the fact that a few days before that this attack was committed, in Catalonia it was sent through an agency transfer some miles of dollars had been "invested" to purchase mobile maps which have been used after the integral 'commando' who killed 106 people.
Police grabbed a extensive documentation.
PP request to Mas suspend fiscal complicity
The leader of CPP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to explain personally to Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those outlined during the campaign, which is to prioritise to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventure philo-sovereignty-seeking as is complicity economic that the nationalist leader to take up to half of his term.
The popular chairwoman of Catalan Render-you arrived at with Artur Mas with security to give the 18 MEPs of having won the election on Sunday, a number more than sufficient to make love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training that will exercise the oppositions herself in the voting of the inauguration.
Of a possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to stay in Congress during the general election, but, for the time, the conversations that Mas has these days with the remains of key political leaders are in Catalan.
And the Chairperson of the PP, for supporting an investiture "should be eliminated all speech advocates and independent," and complicity economic - similar to the Basque country - that converge the leader wants to submit the same to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their gamble to make thin the political apparatus of an administration autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of negotiation on the investiture of Mas will occupy from PC, Jordi Comet Dolors and Montserrat.
MAS met already with Joaquim Nadal (SGP) - which has promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (COL) and today it will with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta Solidaritat Catalana ().
The geriatric contends that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
Owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that night their nurse has killed over 11 elderly
The managers of the geriatric caritat of Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage done to the agency by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, nurse, which killed at least eleven elderly people which it was responsible in the meantime that it has worked.
The director of residence, Joan Sala, came accompanied by a lawyer of the centre, both Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The caritat would be performing the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility we must shoulder the situation processuelle civic leaders."
And to hand the social discrediting that the entity can suffer for not having discovered in time the criminal activities of the nurse of night, the great threat for The caritat now takes the form of substantial claims the legal representatives of the victims' relatives about calculating already.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and that, from this day-here it has not been killed.
Judge said in the sentence that it ordered the exhumation of eight corpses - former patients of the geriatric - care it suspicion that in many cases no doctor is explored personally the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of patients, the formality was taking place by telephone.
The caritat, through the director, flatly denied yesterday this and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been in no time the cause of what happened."
The counsel caritat added that "in this case, there is only an index of negligence on the part of anybody else that is the defendant."
The person already dubbed as' The Angel of Death " has confessed before-yesterday 11 murders and has detailed the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second large-mother.
In this case it resulted in him injecting a sobre-dose of insulin at difference of the first crime committed with a mix of compacted sedatives.
The director of La caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control staff access of the centre to the medicines.
Injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism employed in six of the nine killings that Nurse, in its desire to relieve the suffering of some internal used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify if Vila is not lying in saying that it has sought for its first victims death or less cruel by contrary it has burnt inside giving in the laundry as he has already confessed that it did with the women that he had killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The caritat does not believe the statements of the Nurse by night, either the number of murders confessed, they cannot eliminate the possibility that the number or more large and justified their stance by the different versions which Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance; and the lack of logic in the change of how to kill after committing successfully eight murders.
This is why they say they will remain on the court to clarify the scope of the incident.
ECB 'threat
Investors reacts abruptly yesterday the threat yesterday of Trichet warned that "the markets must not under-estimate our response capacity."
Peripherals differentials have closed to the force and the actions of the European banks have undergone more than 5 per cent.
However, we must not under-estimate the ability of the ECB to make a big mistake and the euro has barely registered a composed, which is a signal of concern.
What happened yesterday was typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it collapses, it is recovering, but motivated by fences and very speculative short positions.
The institutional investor takes to lose its fear.
One month, ECB we cited today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the number of those who remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the purchase plan public debt because of its inefficiencies and elimination all the extraordinary measures of liquidity at term and leaving only access for the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it prolongs the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction for access by the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the programme of buying of bonds and even provide the signal to intensify.
If they cannot fulfil the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they are still blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, God help us!
That during their meeting in May in which they said that they had not even considered purchasing obligations and they fail, the markets had, history might repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday, and on Wednesday he said he had already bought much, causing a fresh collapse in the market.
Yesterday the bill auction for one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% from 4.81 percent to 750 million in the previous auction.
Same as, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points in the entire curve, and we reflect clear a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
Ireland it has published the figures the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Figures estimated 10,000 million represent short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to secure private capital or they should be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and helps reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next Tuesday, the Government will need to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget, and he was not yet sufficient support, therefore, Ireland remains in a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which demonstrates we are a union and we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
Spain, the President took the opportunity to present the measures plan yesterday by the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit-reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revitalize employment ouïes ring to investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
Trichet and the dual effect ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered the 4.5 per cent, double that the rest of the stock.
To difference in February, the response from the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and the surprise effect.
Today a key auction-obligation three years which will be bénéficiée by Trichet, consequently we hope that anyone-CI to resolve with a high demand and help to dispel the doubts on our ability to refinance.
To Spain asking a Plan of Assistance would be a self-defeating-burning.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, with types very expensive and they cut access to markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of the wife of Caesar, "in part to be the sound."
Courage, we can get!

The storm ceases in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, and El enebro Eulen owners.

Red Bull F1 with triumph with a secret weapon of Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars, real time.
Once Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this universe sélecte speed has been marked by the surprise and the success.
In a first time, no one has held into account options for new stable which had just, despite upward trajectory of recent seasons, this past November, in the final stages of the championship they all backed the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lower skill as pilot of the champion German Sebastien Vette, either the engine capacity Renault behind his car, in the world of Formula 1 it mentions the legend of the 'secret weapon' that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to the turn in a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful software simulation process that the German airline was launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals to the top-class automobilistique.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument technology has been used to create chains of assembly factories fabricantes of everyone, from power stations, of high precision instruments.
Objective is replicate accurately simulate the product or process before to build it in a way that is real, in avoiding avoidable costs and flaws.
PLM facilitated the development of cameras with Canon, Sukhoi planes or more well-known commercial vehicles Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, said the fact that the use of the instrument in his factory computer Formula 1 Red Bull has helped to create and implement "in few hours, almost in real time," the changes, changes and improvements detected during racing and tests.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements for vehicles every season.
In the Red Bull team now serve 180 young professionals from high qualifications which, equipped with powerful computer analysis equipment and planning everything sort of modifications on bolides.
The head of Siemens PLM explained that the software is able to analyse and improve all elements bolides of Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Alter the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
Change can move the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production laser based autoclaves and high-tech.
Single as limitation of this madness of technological sophistication there is the amount of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 can spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has implanted the factory of high technology to create and produce its bolides in a town 50 miles from London.
Are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens here-low is considered "top secret."
Personnel for this duty in 580 people, CI-included two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Hero of the Formula 1 Red Bull, without doubt, was the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has serves its participation in the circuits there are other hidden protagonists, whose work is invaluable and visibility is zero.
The director of technology to the factory, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago, one could say that the progress of R + D in the case of car races made the 50% victories and pilots are responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents the 85 per cent of success, while the pilots make the 15% of the value added.
Nevey Vettel and Webber admit that will never be replaced by computer, because they are unpredictable gladiators ."

Sabadell bet on 'steal a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the delegate of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but rejects originally a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
Despite this, it is the collapse in margins of interest, that it will seek to offset partly with incréments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell await capture in three years one million retail customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit future during the three years and to be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will move in 2011 a new master plan that will be a will labilité three years.
The goal at hand to survive without the need to resort to government subsidies of the FROB, is to win ratings market by harnessing a million individuals - 700,000 new customers if we subtract those who can escape the banque-, its greatest challenge, because so far the bank had more spoiled PMEs the companies and that the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250 000 customers 50 individuals and societies.
Its symbol of market individuals is 3.5 per cent, while the companies to exceed the 10 per cent.
Another 2011-2013 the base plan is a gamble on productivity, or that which is the same thing, from austerity, with the reduction of costs as a target, whose provocations will be told by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Little banks dare now to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has upset all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master plan to promote, makes ya it four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the situation on the market has determined its extension for a year.
Customers who leave out those savings will be his main objective.
Small-during a lunch organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a year of "difficult and overwhelming."
The Executive, in fact, believe that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be sluggish."
More, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs ," which is key to the survival of the banking business, insisted-it.
And even though he thinks the war liabilities - which penalises the margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its emissions to achieve liquidity are moving already in the price of credit, to offset the collapse in margins.
"The liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of putting pressure on the credit."
"We have not tightened the tap, but differentials are highest," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He confessed also that the propensity of the banking sector now "is to increase fees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master plan in Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "will seek bigger dimensions."
'Everything will happen next year ," assured-it is.
He claims that the needs of "capital increase drastically 'and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB may replace the market in the diversion of funds in the new recapitalization.
Sabadell after assuring that can survive the close timing of markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that few banking already been predicting as a new crisis of liquidity.
It said that it cannot issue, but in the opposite of what happened in June, it can obtain short-term financing through rest, this lessens the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among boxes
Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers savings funds and insisted again on how quickly to execute the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings funds began, there have been several entities who have assured us that they would not participate in the first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Confederation in Boxes of Spaniard Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most mergers has been achieved, we cannot say that the inclusion of Cajasol of Banca Cívica in the group would be a second phase are adjustments."
Most "was done completely; it is possible that, instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all great processes have been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has worked very much in this exercise also ," has pointed out the leader.
In statements during a small-luncheon of the Association des leaders and Exécutifs of Aragon (ADEA) Olavarrieta briefed that the concentration does happen "with the greatest speed possible and we have to be very pleased with the way she operates in deadlines that were set in the past, not now in the business plans with the Bank of Spain showed emphatisé-it.
"The changeover of 45 boxes with a average 28.500 million asset volume at 17 with 75.500 million trial is unequalled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel ," underlined-it.
Olavarrieta acknowledged "there is a range of views somewhat successful on the slow process" which demonstrate "sérosité and of a lack of sense" because "this that the Bank of Spain is a reminder that it should respect the time before the end of the year."
Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, provided yesterday that Spain has the financial system the most rigorous of all Europe and "probably" in the world and he has applied to people who questioned by a "lack of knowledge."
The leader has mentioned that given the current economic conditions, "we can be very, very happy" with the situation of financial entities and building savings, a system which has started a process "very important" and "goes to the greater speed possible."
It also pointed out that the Spanish banking sector has certainly learned stress tests that ECB has achieved in July.
Zapatero and the red line German
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it establishes conditions for the whole EU.
Tensions on markets have caused doble a government response.
Of a side, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, which will vary of tax reductions for PMEs, regulating private placement or deletion of 426 euros in aid for unemployed professional contribution to privatisation of 49% from AENA, airport management to Barajas and El Prat Loteries and 30% of the state.
Another, the vice-Chairperson Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president, Felipe González, unites to criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility to remove the current crisis.
How must-it interpret these movements?
The position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefining of the euro.
And that Germany has a radical new vision of what must be his future, that shocks with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced resistance in Germany are beginning to speculate about the three possible missions of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by she-same, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency zone.
The second reclamation Mark, even though now it seems of science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater control economic macro--, budgetary rigour, fines on countries who transgress, possible suspension of payments to and extension to private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear, and it is a long time that it defines itself, so now there is no place for excuses.
First in 2009, when both the European Commission, IMF as expectations the deficits, the German Government had invented a constitutional reform to prevent from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thinks there should make (plans for fiscal stringency and stability of public finances) and its European partners, CI-includes France, used.
The second blow of centre-European country was when Merkel has hardly prolonged the decision to bail out Greece.
Then-where she was the subject of a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and by public opinion and were published against the rescue of Greece.
Ultimately, to the end of October, Merkel reiterates a clear position, calling the reform of the European Union treaties to make a rescue possible the country and force at the same time to the private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti-globalization-Europe, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly watered-down, was approved and, the following month, we should see the process of reform of the EU, which makes possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it did not believe to pass.
And it we said all that, even though we now must take measures with which it may not be too much agreement, from that date the old way the euro would have landed.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary zone, in which the countries who transgress the rules will be severely punished, they may be obliged to be declared in default and, in this case here-, the private sector will bear also a party.
Germany says that we must follow a harsh way of growth with a high rate of saving and investment, restraint in the use, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances.
An alternative based on debt and the construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, which presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
Setting is clear.
And it would be difficult not to hear him.
It is not just to extend the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what this absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive us we-same.
I hope that the current turbulence leave happen towards us greater tranquillity.
And state take the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It appears that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and its twin statement (the reforms promised after the meeting the past on Saturday with the major companies and the announcement yesterday of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism from Merkel, it has opened the way for the idea that it has to be at the house.
But the red line that Germany has outlined is, and they do not seem to be moving.
And the possibilities that, you cannot exclude that abandon a monetary zone too packed with countries little serious.
-and in this case there, Germany we can always say that she we had warned.
Sport and fraud the law
Similar tricks to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not to escape penalties.
Eviction hatched in principle by two players from Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink on the anti--sports of such behaviour, and if both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before closing the match (that already earned their team clearly), the two players have deliberately lost time when they misbehaved to identify the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will use the regulatory sanction during the match for the next match against Auxerre and dam can pass without cartons to the next phase.
Ultimately, the misconduct committee of UEFA has sanctioned with two matches, the team coach, José Mourinho and various are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances as gasoil-similar or is not a new practice, otherwise quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the rules not-written, but followed, this sport.
Some of the debate emerged in the case related to the fact that this has been a team player as the entity of Real Madrid (in whose anthem has the nobility and honor and which in times past has fined its players to similar actions) and dramatizing orchestrated, seems-by Mourinho, which adds one more episode dilatée to its history of technical specialist histrionique and provocative.
In any event, the debate whether such behavior not specifically prohibited by the rules contradicted principles of sport is-à-dire, if actions with those committing fraud to law; because, in effect, they are respectful actions with Regulation sportsmen but seem to circumnavigate its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of damage they cause to the sport.
A property that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, something with these actions was not endangering is-à-dire there was no violent game.
Another of the property which it referred with the game right is avoid that the perpetrators take team players in a manner contrary unjust of the team, which is not the case, either.
However, the paradoxical result of the action of players from Real Madrid is that she does not accept to what we normally characterised as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules had not been carried out in secret in an attempt to avoid the penalty, but their work has just tried to be the most obvious possible to receive the penalties of the referee.
They expected and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that the perpetrators get the mistakes people examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we are not in a situation not to the rival, it obtains an advantage in the same match either, because, of course, the result of the action involves letting their own team with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match, either, because the club could not count on these players.
Course the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions' League without cartons that can threaten their future participation at a match.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of uncertainty, because the team could be removed suddenly and to hand this, with this action, the players do a match penalty and spend the second cycle of cardboard where the suspension due to accumulated cards happens with one fewer than in the first round.
So that, climb to the top, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not contravene the spirit of sport, which is nevertheless part strategic decisions that promote the benefit as much as the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not operated to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud the law) m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they are subjected to it.
They have made a strategic decision not foil the penalty or flee that-here.
Even if the border between genius and fraud the law is fuzzy in this occasion I think that it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy seems-it is, is because of two factors: Because there has been a two Auto-expulsions and how to pass on the director to the cause.
The harm the principles of sports by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive force offered to capture the Christmas dinners to groups at NCB
The dictatorship the calendar focuses this year a flood of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financed by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 Euros.
As the nougat, and all the lottery when December comes also pick up the dinner of groups before Christmas who continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis you have lead in an offensive to capture prices adjusted to the customer in the majority: Almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros at dinners or meals, coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
For completing complicated accounting, the timing of this year (as on New Year's Eve night falls on Friday) has concentrated applications in the week commencing 13 December, having as result until now a flood of reservations for dinners for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which was the origin of the difficult times, there are many companies which have eliminated the public dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize by paying from their own pockets.
Any is the present economic climate, they are asking all prices to battle, confirms the president of Barcelona Gremi of Restauració, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers now, do not dare to predict how it will be the festive season this month.
"People reflecting much before reserve."
'They want to release, but they pay much attention to the price ," mentions-it.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a price and with a good service," adds-it is that and recalls that the customers have a tendency to take a level with the crisis so that the edge around EUR 25 became majority into the request.
In a survey of various establishments in the centre there is the collapse of demand for the night of the 17.
Soteras the group indicates that there is a true boom of requests for this Friday-here, the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they replied by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with phrases complete of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of one group of powerful, Andilana, with 16 schools in the town (Hostal of the Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), the peculiarity of the timetable has assumed more early bookings, even from the start of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same price of the past year, with menus for all tastes 19,95 of EUR 30 'detailing-they.
Grup year, that includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic, having detected an increase in billing since mid-2001 and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources the group refer only to the 18 is also a wildly-active day in groups of friends who celebrate in advance of the holidays.
Six to their menus of group they have added one per the noël, with 30 euros or more as budget famous and the perception that there is a willingness to spend a 10% increase over the previous year, rather than demand more details, as the Catalan wine made according to the method - champenoise cava.
They see the first signs of improvement in certain companies again called upon their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
From the employers Fecasarm (which includes such entities as the Association for the Bars, Restaurants and Divertissement of Barcelona), its Vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the opportunity to start to see the end of the tunnel and contends that overall reservations are "lively," even if the clients "are negotiating at maximum."
This is true, the hope that the festivities did not fall, no matter who pays, indicates-it.
Pakistan generates the nuclear program the United States a great concern
Islamabad produced atomic weapons in "a faster rate than imports other country."
The leaching of Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan, and the Department of the State of the United States in portal filtered the Wikileaks confirms the huge concerns caused by Washington on Pakistan's nuclear program.
To share the details and that offer revealing tasty on the content of the conversations and thoughts diplomatic representatives north-United States accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the area of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases' and that the volatile Asian country producing nuclear weapons" at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the arms are not houses, but they are difficult to make components emmagasinnées by their destruction in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons concerns in Washington.
This is as well as the US ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit by the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities of the country under Taliban attack, the distribution of nuclear material that the rumour and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States but also by Russia, and proliferate as a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan was the recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the lower levels of education and cultural, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who worked in nuclear or missile programmes" said the expert from Yuri Korolev, the Russian Ministry Externes of during a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the area of nuclear proliferation, and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear armas production.
A dispatch of the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, argues that: "The transparency is frequently non-existent; offers aid remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for south Asia, said that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear arms at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Patterson also request the ambassador to Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, understood that there will be "very clear" to the chief that "the Lord of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting of the Head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera responsible to a high for the anti-globalization-terrorist fight to avoid the new incursion.
Interpol issues a red alert to monitor the movements and locate to Assange.
All aspects linked to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated maze when it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Then Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track movements" of Assange.
However, this is not an arrest order traditional.
In addition, that-CI is not new, otherwise it datte of 20 November.
And-CI has nothing to even with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but to the accusations of sexual abuse that the then-Australian faces in Sweden.
Increasingly, the Creator of Wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knew where Mr Assange contact and how."
20 the international police body having headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the next to requests of Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities in this country.
Thus the 188 countries of Interpol received indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain interim his arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanation the organization consider the appeal red notice a clear pathway for arrest --que the National Police Force - must achieve, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
The movement has outraged lawyers of Assange, which yesterday issued a letter dénonceant that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years, has shown willing to respond via video-conference questions from Swedish authorities.
They also remind that Assange has requested and obtained the permits to leave Sweden the prosecutor in his case, which has been compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Berias, security chief of Stalin.
"This appears to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While everyone seeks - and Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to find itself in a place unknown, but it is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview from a undetermined location director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the secretary of State of the United States, Senator Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates they épient to the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States had signed, she should resign, 'said-it.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the Secretary House Press-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the calls of resignation.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a webpage should be interested," said-it for CNN.
Obama-even appointed a high official of the anti-globalization-terrorist fight - Rusell Travers, to prevent future leaks of documents.
The test from door-floor of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King congressiste which starting in January will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower House has asked the Department to the State that it is exploring the possibility of incorporating in the Wikileaks list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue in any person that provides input or assistance."
Even further gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has come back on the statements having said that, Assange must "be killed."
"Obama should transform it into a target and use an airplane without crew or something similar ."
A person who has not asked for an apology has been Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, ex-Arkansas governor and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone who is in the Government which has filtered information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," stated-it to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with clins at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot at its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more plural and the end of the system assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the formula for resolving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without the north because of the loss of 11 members and half the votes.
President of the Party is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient to the followers of the former leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time it knew the influence of this sector is now so diluted that the liar and that absolutely cannot give headaches that he had with other factions been extinguished.
It is for this that the leader will attempt to win its new criticism Esquerra with clins eyes that enable it to shield up to the municipal elections.
Begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will decide her continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not your hand.
If carodistes want to convey a certain vote of criminalisation to the President, they may done without any fear retaliation.
In fact, ranks the head to avoid the image of division and submission to its person.
In several interviews he said that he would consider not ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "the Bulgarian" would not be right.
Carod require people close to the president a little more than put his position available of the militancy, a gesture that will not apply where Puigcercós control the body maxim among the congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will accept with the Executive a road map through May.
For it, they hope to participate in the preparation of the document for strategic reorientation that the leadership will submit to the voting of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of those-CI of scheduling the congress for the autumn of 2011, that leaders will consider their course.
The leader of ERC has confessed that "chorus of many" is affecting the stability and that his goal is to do that once and for all the organization was able to wash his laundry room in a family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in its blog is symptomatic.
Regarded the ideologist Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if it was fact.
And he listed five, he emphasized two.
The first, 'redesign' the executive to account for at least 90% of the militancy is-à-dire, including new figures from the sector Carod fan of.
The second may be the great new.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operating.
Thus, he defends a reform of regulations which permit the realization of Congress through of delegates elected by the electorate.
Put an end to the model assembly, an exception within the Spanish party system, was an obsession ToS Puigcercós, who has already fought in this sense in the past two Congresses.
Actually, convulse the Conclave in 2008 gave the leadership to review the model assembly in a special congress of reform of the rules.
This meeting remains unfinished because the tide of recent years did not address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors to the lookout, the time could be good for the resume and closing it for good.

Obama promotes in Twitter the law to favour students without papers
'If you agree with the approval of the Law Dream Act, is silent senators and demand-their to approve this legislation "has Twitté the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in her personal account of the social network Twitter.
'If you agree with the approval of the Law Dream Act, is silent senators and demand-their to approve this legislation "has Twitté Obama.
Its short message keeps open a cyber relationship with a broader document that asked the public to contact immediately the senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that they hope soon, now it is a time to listen to your voices," mentions-it.
The message were leaked after the 42 senators, Republicans have threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of tax cuts from the time of Bush and the funding of the government continue.
Such a freeze, announced in a letter signed by all 42 Republicans senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, the president Robert Gibbs refers-floor said confidant that it is once the fiscal problem is solved we can fix a AGENDE for the rest of the projects.
"I think it has a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to solve the problem of tax before the end of the year..."
"I think that we can get an agreement at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," said-it.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would seek a "vote to close debate 'Act for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students may be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or Act of Rêve American would legalise 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before age 16, they remained in the country in the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, in moments when partisan organizations of project stakeholders intense lobbying to ensure approval of the Law.
Democrats, the majority of whom supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this reason that supporters of the Dream Act require the votes of several Republicans if other Democrats deciding vote against the initiative.
Among Republicans more courtisés there were the senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux outgoing, Florida, which has supplemented the mandate known Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have in the past supported the Dream Act was Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said that they would not support him in another opportunity.
Another Republican who had supported it, John McCain, did not define its position until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the greatest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature it puts its finger on the wound
Plaisirs of the second stage of the language has been a drive in which the participants flaunted narrating
'Sex in the language, I understand that, but... the nail on the head? That hope-t-on of me? "Asked the writer asked Luisa Valenzuela has open the second step Plaisirs of language, a cycle which famous literature in Spanish and which this time used the title under-its question (another fairground the round table was dedicated in the Sex in the language, explained-it).
The nail on the head ..." we are in a quandary about ," the Argentine writer slowly launched to the public, most of the young people, who had assembled at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderate by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a dedicated text to Gonzalo Celorio as Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person, as a player seeking what is the "evil," it is going to a doctor to another without getting a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue it fate convinced: "Patience is not my strong, it is can-be my head."
At the end, after a frustrated with the approach traumatologue which cut him the breath to the middle of the aisle, but he explains that wound is not a scientific term; this is the that reveals psychanalyste the mystery: " the evil is what is in fact opened, the symbolic is the scar ."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on the wound I have only have known that this is open, and that it does not exist ', but convinced that the joys and the pitfalls of the language must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with both.
Nicaraguayen the Sergio Ramírez briefed also a fetching storytelling he has entitled Éloge to invention, where the heart of the matter is no nombré but at some point was discovered.
With keyboard of magic realism, it spoke a well-known ensorceleuse affecting the clouds was return of people who had gone or was repairing the virtues a damoiselle had lost, a storytelling that transfers to speak then America, the news that has been from the beginning of its own columnists and cita to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises excesses narratives capitans of conquerors.
"Cervantes that we invented all (writers) has ridiculed false witnesses appeared in stories presented as real, but in a way we could never aitre conté American history with an imagination who lacked the same modesty."
However, emphasized-as "the mad and the liars have the best fantasy" and reality here, converge with mendacity, we no longer know how much narrative belongs to a gang or another, where the literary fiction reached its apogee.
This is termed the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to her legacy that it is what the story."
To turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with its panel The must on the wound.
The Cubaine-a Puerto Rican has puts its own on the great scourge of social violence that his country is facing - and Latin America shares - product disputes of traffics and sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry the good songs contain a tacit pledge that is not obviously premeditated," indicated-they, after quoting that reality to the literature is the communication and the size of the commitment between the author and the reader, and that it is a "chemical reaction."
Night is over with the involvement of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "this must on the head of the writer committed."
He felt that in a world experiencing in high-speed also in which the intellectual habits and control consciences which work to the advantage of the strident, "behind every assertion there is a small and not behind every denial there is a little yes'.
'To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality, we must qualify: And qualifying means much of time put the nail on the head, and disturb the people that feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, and without nuance by established ideas and also bored the powers who prefer a world in black and white,' said-there, inviting to recover the meaning to write.
Romano to hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the number.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are a further two different styles themselves, marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast from the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final, it has had some ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if he so far has not brought in the head and it is for this that this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina eventually consolation with the medal under-champion, it was a step behind the winners and curiously, with the same team he played consecutive final.
The strategist santiste arrived in his first final as entraineur in the Tournoi of Opening 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which it had lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, Closure 2003 he also arrived in duel decisive and lost again with the overall result 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered a fresh setback, because his team has done an equal match of 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in a series of penalties it has obtained a benefit-1 for 3 with two opportunities to obtain the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 metres and he suffered the leap the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and a with Monterrey, his rival for the tournament, so it does not have the same fate, he is trying to detach itself of the curse to celebrate for the first time a connection, even if it says that for him, the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, and I do not wish to break no statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when he was asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembered many the last final, which he assured he had learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the umpire siffle the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to learn we were already prepared to run and I believe that it is a lesson, before the end of the match we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could define themselves by penalties, what not worry because it assigns in its players: 'We do ever to reach the number of penalties they try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we can that we prepare, the earlier tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to hold the title in our hands, but we escaped, we served as a lesson to the final and we hope that we have in this situation-here'.
Romano now has an opportunity not to be a technician in-champion tea and the glory for the first time under the titles.

Illegal migration will continue without any problem
Bill of conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten when all three opposition parties reported Wednesday, that they could not support it.
"I am strongly supported on the Charter."
"I am standing with the party which has established the granite under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to a year a person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants, violating Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it takes at the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government will do, " Mr Duceppe has said.
NPD the criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, was rejected out of hand the critics that his party is not quite strong on illegal immigrants.

The new unit is not unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask the establishment of a committee of inquiry on the subject.
Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, contends that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January.
Metropolitan France possesses a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet the announcement on Tuesday has surprised more than one.
I must say that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services of Quebec, on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It should be the critic péquiste more for that in public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, characterizes this announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "solution bricolée on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it, merely-it is to say."
"We are aware of this problem-there."
For President the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
'Mr Charest insists does not want to set up the committee, more people think like you and I that he has something to hide,' explains-it.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, but the resignation of Jean Charest," explains about Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break the impasse, it therefore suggest to Quebec to give a mandate to the auditor general to investigate the collusion and corruption.
'You must be able to broaden the mandate the Auditor-General, instalment-it is that.
It also finds that Quebec could give the supervisors the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling it to force people to testify.
Creating a permanent escouade is not the only project in the cartons Charest of government.
Quebec also seek in Ottawa of changing the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
The request issued by the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, which informed the justice minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson, looks impressively on some amendments related to this issue.
Spring at the 2001 operation, which struck the motorcycle groups, while the Criminal Code was not adequate, 131 people had been arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently fact adopt the Law into gangsterism.

Partially Dupont blamé
Moderator radio of Québec Stéphane Dupont suffered a setback before the Partial Canadian Council standards of the Radio-Television (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and the Haitians as his vulgar language on the airwaves.
The CCNR judge that Mr. Dupont and CHOI 98.1 FM his team had the right to express their views, but that certain statements contained "the information inaccurate on social assistance, representations unduly negative of Haitians and the language, which is not suitable to be aired during the day."
Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had killed themselves, did not breach its codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during their broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made in response to a complaint of the Common Front of people assisted social of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issuance were inaccurate.
Presenters must submit information solid rather than to be false.
Regarding suicide, the Moderator Stéphane Dupont had found that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
Majority of the members of the Committee had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes involved" Dupont the noon "raised a sensitive issue in a fair manner and appropriate."
No reprimand was chosen in his place.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to an deal-à-face media which had attracted a great deal of response.
CHOI of the moderator said that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know for sure that the people receive really need the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not improper, but their cumulative effect is unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have served my suspension of three days here-over."
"My file is virgin for a year and a half," said the leader.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of crass language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has worked "to-beyond its obligation."
Consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, to announce those decisions once during prime time hours in three days.

450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Quebec has granted of 450 million dollars in contracts for engineering firms for the hydro-electric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart this avalanche of more 100 contracts, is a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Working SM Axor and the most important, that the administration of the project, for a sum of $295 million without competitive bidding.
This consortium called Energy administration was formed in 2004 parallel to choice of Hydro-Quebec to instruct the private sector responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project $5 billion.
The start of 2005, the Energy managing consortium were to pick up the lucrative contract without there having been to public tender.
Party for the Quebecois, consortia of firms have a serious ethical problem which may eliminate competition and lead to a rise in prices.
'This is the new way of the collusion and to tear down the competition. "
'-à-dire that people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly, "said the MP yesterday péquiste Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue at the National Assembly, because it expresses see hardly how the public interest can be used this way.
Minister of Natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied after-noon, vigorously denying that there has been collusion for this contract.
"I began to have my voyage," after complaining it has-, supporting that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lack of rigour."
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologises.
The consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually an alliance for a limited time allowing two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
Eastmain draft contains a high level of complexity because of the scope of the work.
The site is under way and should be implemented until 2012.
However, the contract has been awarded without competition act; there had been negotiations.
Also, the consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for projects relatively simple.
As revealed last week The Duty, the formula of the consortia in the engineering sector-counsel investigated the government.
A brief survey of the business registry of Quebec can count more than 200 companies, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its major competitors, CIMA +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin-Tecsult and Roche and other.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single legal entity, Dessau.
On the consortium managing energy, Normandeau minister stressed that " the territory of James Bay meets the dynamic of working hand-of specific and Hydro-Quebec that is of specific way since the 1970s ."
Eastmain the large boss of the proposed, Réal Laporte, the Society's energy James Bay (SEBJ), provided an explanation which has blinking on the fact that the contract of newly-arrived of the project has been granted.
"If you're going into tender and that there were few bidders, your price will be higher. "
"You have two choices: Either you take those in this market-here and you say: We are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price. "
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the responsibility of the people, " said Mr. Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium managing energy is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000 secured by the Parti Quebecois.
Contracts have been awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for draft-1-A Eastmain-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, The Customer were 109 genius-council contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including laboratories of soil.
SNC Lavalin-swept 22 contracts Génivar has achieved 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, not counting its participation to newly-arrived Energy.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled 783 344 $449, including the contract to Energy managing 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard intimated that the four firms comprising the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Working and FS Axor) are "well-known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also bound to these firms which the "finance," before specifying that it was rather to its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The label 'green "revocable
More green but frankly sceptical.
Quebec the consumer very little confidence to actors for sustainable development, but also brand fair and qualifications écologisantes to guide its choice.
Worse, even if he is floundering in a media universe where the messages for more responsible consumption abound, it deplores a lack of credible information, incompetence that he describes even brake on his commitment, said the responsible consumption Gender Barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they did increase the consumption of products described as socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers seem however give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say indeed not believe environmental commitment of companies like the green advertising companies, reveals the measure drafted by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the Sherbrooke University.
Other observation: Half of consumers questioned the reliability of official qualifications on products so-called fair, but also of the credibility of products and brands being as environmentally responsible way, indicates the Gender Barometer.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
Information to responsible consumption seems however essential to stimulate this aspect of consumption driven now by almost a third of consumers, of Quebec.
Indeed, a vacuum and the untrustworthiness of information calmeraient the ardour of 46 per cent of consumers.
It is the second barrier identified by the Gender Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are also suspicious alleged performance products or green services that it was seeking to put in the hands.
On another note, the consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed mark one or more products to meet their beliefs.
Up to 61 per cent, they also fostered of purchases from merchants in their neighbourhood and preferred procurement of food produced in their region, the Gender Barometer indicated.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum 100 this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king recycling, which is seeking to reduce its environmental footprint by catering for the protection of animals.
But its ecological and social conscience seems, however, to stay out of his car, said the Gender Barometer: In 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they have used public transportation or carpooling advocated green to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling were also backed by 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging inquiry behavioural, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A loan from the State to the buy-back of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who were asked to commit financially in the purchase of film eXcentris by the League and the Angus Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but a loan only.
The Development Corporation and the Angus Parallèle, who hoped one donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy at Daniel Langlois the cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in restoring him its full vocation cinéphilique, are not getting what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than donations expected, the government of Quebec offers a loan whose amount would be lower than expectations, which could be a viable solution at concessional, at least in the view of the sources from the headquarters of the State.
A first plan of action and calls of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec the spring, but those requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the Minster St-Pierre by the chairman of the Society of Business Development (cultural SODEC), François Macerola, which Kit eXcentris pilot.
It has sent a final report there are a dozen days.
But the cabinet against-proposal reached the SODEC Tuesday.
Parallèle and the Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the idea of the gift of the state really should be discarded.
Recall that the Association owners and of cinemas cinéparcs of Quebec was opposed to a direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris, saying that the Ministry of Culture was not to finance housing projects, which he has not done to other cinema.
But several speakers the middle instead demanding a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the Employer céans, has for a decade been to the cinema to author in its premises of the complex after having paid him-even its construction, which could justify an exemption by the Council of the treasure.
Lack of bathrooms for independent film-makers is huge in Montreal, and had known eXcentris retain its customers.
Society and the Angus Parallèle, Christian Yaccarini, piloting, for their part, a campaign for private financing, hoping to collect 700,000 $to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of three screens, The Parallèle, continues to broadcast films eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February in projecting a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois The men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled The Duty and it is not known what he and his group believe proposals to the decline.
Lifted the veil on a Canada complexé...
New US diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks to lift the veil on what the United States regarded as-the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but they will reveal the big sense of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
And, American diplomats are surprised that each elector of Canada has no relations canado-American spirit go vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative Government to get its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, over the public yesterday, offers more details croustillants that the substantive content to eat.
Cable dated 22 September 2008, in the midst of federal election campaign, reports how-United States is not one of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the amazement of the US Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offer some explanations for the situation.
"Canadian an inferiority complex almost inherent biases can-be the Canadian political leaders to talk about internal challenges of daily life rather than to bring this election on-United States (as in the campaign on free-exchange of 1988) ', writing-it.
States therefore-US was, concludes-it, "the proverbial elephant in this election: Omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk."
Ambassador includes even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, considers-it is the ability of a candidate, a party and still more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a factor-key that voters have in mind by going to vote."
Another expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, in which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan by 30 to 40 billion dollars," writing Mr Breese.
Anywhere is-it mentions that the government has had to extend the parliament before Christmas to avoid being toppled by the coalition and that the opposition parties make its survival to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, is warning Washington image increasingly negative as the dramatic series broadcast on CBC cross-refer-United States.
Ambassador was worried emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there were references bit subtle to Maher Arar, to the "No Fly-@-@ List ', or even kidnapping for interrogations by the CIA.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner that if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners to Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner responded yes, but on the basis of "case by case basis."
At the end of the meeting, is-he writes, "it has given a paper to the Secretary of State on Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin. "
"Secretary has agreed to review the file."
Lastly, that tempers are running high on the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former close advisor Stephen Harper, said on the radio of CBC that the head of the mass exodus would be "assassinated."
It echoed Mike Huckabee to-United States.
A global plan to renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday to Cancun a renovation plan the lighting domestic, commercial and industrial sectors in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which is almost equal to a third of the additional reduction needed that to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan comes in the wake of the large concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt to Cancún to compensate for its lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday if bulbs inflammable who monopolize yet 50 to 70 per cent of the market for bulbs were replaced fluocompactes or, better, by of LEDs (LED or "LED" in English) the bulk of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GHG emissions on the planet in order to illuminate the human would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
Is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, as States-US, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are involved in the voluntary reduction plans that should put the overall GHG emissions of 53 gigatonnes to 48 gigatonnes.
But it must subtract this assessment still 5 gigatonnes in order to stabilize by 2020 the rise of climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it becoming out of control.
In bulbs inflammable materials, 95% of the energy to dissipate in the form of heat, with the remaining 5% of the light.
With bulbs fluocompactes, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75 per cent and with the new bulbs for LEDs, it reduces need energy to two again.
Bulbs fluocompactes lasted an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched the Philips manufacturing this week, the company has participated in the study, have a life expectancy of 25 hours and consume 80 per cent less energy than a bulb smouldering, which gives an idea of the economy with a possible alternative plan, which would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also operate with rhéostats increasingly issuing very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists showed reservations against fluocompactes bulbs because they contain mercury, and that must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always feasible in developing countries unless manufacturers follow instructions.
But, said the report, the largest source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the light bulb fluocompacte, but coal-fired power stations, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in bulbs inflammable materials.
-United States only, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report specifies the gains that would each country with the international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save and $1 billion a year in purchases electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost $2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire from the nervousness the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, had claimed the publication "without delay" of the presidential election results in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The secretary general stressed the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without delay highlighted a door-floor of the head of the United Nations."
"It calls on all parties and the Ivorian institutions to act responsibly and refrain from any actions until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite pressure by foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had missed the deadline for Wednesday midnight without publishing results, three days after the ballot on Sunday.
Approximately 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of the Commonwealth had charged on television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second round between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
Camp Gbagbo account on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by the ex-rebels of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, asserted that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the northern region had discouraged supporters of the incumbent president to go out and vote.
All the election might be canceled if complaints by Gbagbo are accepted by the Constitutional Council.
Yet opponents of Gbagbo felt that the highest court in the country is not neutral as it is headed by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north which denies any link with the ex-rebels, as "unacceptable " the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo has blocked the publication of the results, because he knows that he has lost and complain to the Constitutional Council, having prevented the election committee of disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was expected to seal a reunification process and reconciliation of a country still split in two for years.
The UN warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of votes against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who has received the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For over ten months, to July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying," held the opinion in suspense in France, put diplomacy warning, and has contributed to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attentive gaze-diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde showed some below of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée has explained its strategy for Americans, period to give them advice for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of tourists.
They illustrate how leaders in France have sought to convince Washington that the liberation of a young French woman had not had to return for the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iranian held in France and sought by the United States for smuggling materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally they put under a harsh light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to promote the idea that the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
Diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris "Iran: Comments French on how to handle cases of hostages."
The advisor to the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle-Orient, Patrice Paoli, is discussing with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French approach.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals selected of force in Iran.
'Made noise,' say-they, "martelez constantly" in the media, the words' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence "and" immediate release ."
Needed in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
'Made-the fact that the Iranians are asking you not to do so ."
Because past attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are masters in delaying tactics ."
Mr. Richier added that the detention of foreign nationals is "an Iranian tactics familiar: The taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Announces that the release from jail of Clotilde Reiss (which will take effect on 16 August when she takes refuge in the French Embassy) "will require payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros of bond).
And it said that the Élysée Palace will pre-empt other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "going to get worse."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another a few 1 800 French citizens living in Iran ', said-it.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is leaving prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is distributed: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose-United States demands for the extradition for the illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, will be released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The US embassy, as many observers wondered about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington which clamping down on the illegal networks Iranian acquisition of nuclear programme, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has-they accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
Elysée, said-it, had not only 'been completely taken by surprise by the decision of the court ," but had sought to oppose it.
"There have been exchanges loud among the French Presidency and the Attorney-General" (then, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but 'the French Government cannot revisit the decision "judicial, observes-it.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Elysée adviser comprised a telephone number, clutching, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée has spared no efforts, through statements and of "leaks" in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad-plays a role 'important' and 'affect' "Ombudsman."
Americans observed that activity without irony, and realises that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several press articles passed French the official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "The 'media blitz of Records' French '.
To the basis both 'gratitude "expressed to Mr. Assad, wondered the embassy in Paris.
" despite their declarations full of praise, the French official privately admit that they had only a vague notion of what the Syrians really did ."
Document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée Palace to pay into this fiction.
Intense communications effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analysis-it.
A policy launched in 2008, who "had been seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and imméritée."
To "exaggerate the role of Syria," Paris seeks' to demonstrate to Syria which praises it may draw in playing a constructive role in the region ."
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.
The US Embassy knows good source.
11 August, François Richier entrusted: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thank you anyway."
'This should at least stir confusion among Iranians ."
Clotilde Reiss go in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy to the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, from Senegal, and in Syria, for their 'active role in support of the release of our compatriot ."

Draft legislation will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online gambling blocking access to these games after midnight, to youth under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play in these games all night and then difficult to study at the school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health, and for their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the official in charge of the draft law.
Online games will be accessible again to 6 a.m. the following morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, has-it clarified.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the amount of access to these daily games for young people whose parents request it, added the official.
It will also make available to people who demanded free software that make it possible to reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most 'connected "and newspapers regularly reported events related to extensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world competition of online gambling.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, about 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: The Fifa means countries organizers
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa means on Thursday the organisers of the world countries Coupes 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice where the influence and lobbying are likely to take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of the Fifa competition will be held in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgium).
To 2022 will be much more exotic, the IFRC hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia, after a first on the African continent by 2010, or continue its implantation-United States or Far-Orient (Japan, South Korea).
The list of leading party delegations (David Cameron and Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and Dutch, Zidane and Beckham, Cruyff) is a measure of economic and political challenges of the World Cup.
The wrangling behind the scenes that will last until the last minute.
For the rest, which is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the assessment report of the Fifa cases, English, Portuguese hispano- (2018) and American (2022) possess better arguments that their competitors.
But such considerations do not wield very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corrupt practices of two members of the EC (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, could thus have ruined the chances of his country, home of football which is hosting the World Cup, only once, in 1966.
BBC has released a layer, on Monday, a documentary which hones in three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Else upsetting the Fifa and embarrassing the English officials, who are engaged in a intense lobbying in recent weeks, together with David Cameron first in line.
The head of the Government hoped to repeat the shot managed by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of OJ-2012.
This profusion-they will be enough to restore the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the China-US Spain-Portugal is no shortage of stages with its strengths already prepared, its expertise (in Spain 82 World-, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and culture (soccer).
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could doucher their ambitions.
Potential retaliation against the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are increasing the symbol of Russia became an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of his dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in preparation for the vote " in a thinly veiled allusion to accusations by the English press against the EC.
"Cover includes mud, it is trying to undermine," launched Mr. Putin.
For 2022, States-US, strong from the experience of 1994, as the logical favourite.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a head-start on Japan and South Korea, which have built separately a wonderful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries who co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: The awarding of World-2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by the Fifa, which would remove the Asian opportunity was for 2022.
With Qatar, who has lifted the game suggesting stages futurist, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion into new parts, but the two countries have more risks than certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from weak TV rights were acquitted (because of jet-lag) by European countries, the sinews of war to Fifa.
Second mandate: The
De Gaulle really hesitate.
Mitterrand led to believe that it was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have had no hesitation.
Nicolas Sarkozy and even less than them.
An office in the Elysée Palace is another.
Thus the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But evidently does not go well with the hand of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then we must act as if the question were still.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, without even believe this, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that it would take its decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011."
He raised before parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening to the Elysée Palace, the prospect of 'two mandates " has thus caused a bit of volatility.
Etait-this the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was far.
President merely recall that the constitutional review of 2008 restricted to two the number of quinquennia.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he raised the presidential, on tone of humour at such meetings.
'At worst, or at best, you again for seven and a half years ago with me ," had-it launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: 'Do not believe that I am not considering the step after. "
His remarks before-yesterday do not make it more candidate that the day before, they do not make it less.
If they provoke the comments, it is for a dual reason.
Accelerating the race for the nomination to the PS, on the one hand.
But is not vying to Ségolène Royal, who is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
That is the opposite because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that much at PS require up battle earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the nomination of François Fillon to Nicholas Sarkozy (46 per cent to 44 per cent, according to BVA-The Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP this-them, immediately reacted cautiously and the entourage of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the defeat possible, it will not be a candidate," gives Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe they can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: Forced the ECB to keep its government securities purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year should be an opportunity to clarify how to exit or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of the operations' non-conventional monetary policy achèver which should be at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis, the Institute of Frankfurt can probably not afford to be as obligatory under only worsen a situation more than tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has also hailed the role of the ECB in favour of the resolution to the debt crisis states in Europe.
She did not want to say if she believed that the central bank should do more, such as increasing its programme to purchase sovereign bond.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...) ."
The previous day, to Brussels, at her hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more information about its intentions, simply stating that the programme of buying of government securities in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we choose " at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, the lowest level on record since May 2009.
In the facts, the Treasury bond purchases by the ECB have doubled last week at nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the operators in indiscretions to market, it would have carried out new purchases of titles Irish and Portuguese yesterday.
Total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased to 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations of further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect significant change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, this last is still unlimited allowances of liquidity under conditions and generous for periods of between one week to three months.
Economists expect today to what this will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it alters significantly its programme."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual phasing-out announced during the first quarter of 2011 is likely," anticipates its side Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the road its interventions on the market, the public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchasing obligations to pep up a sluggish market," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance exhibitions of European banks to the markets of sovereign debts in the euro area, the issuing institute has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market.
'It must at all costs be a substitute for lack of investors in the market and acting in such a way to prevent a soaring yields paid by the most fragile ," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are high, those states will be most bothered to reduce their indebtedness, otherwise stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is the price.
Italy, the Berlusconi government the back round
After an early week worrying for Italy, the situation was a little freer, yesterday, with the bond rate retreats to 10 years.
A return to calm.
Emerging from a meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the Presidents of region have said having heard Giulio Tremonti called the situation an "indecipherable" and expect a week-end "unpredictable," and this he was then denied.
Tuesday, at least, the gap with the German long rates had risen to a record 210 basis points and the price of the contracts for hedging against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had vanished at 263 points, resulting in a panic in Rome.
By the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain the gap with the German rate was above 400 basis points.
But his arm right, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by the "turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that in Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is as the Portugal" said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth, tax revenues and the depression that goes with them, thus running the State the risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts of Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now awaited to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget being considered in the Senate respectively on 1.3% and 2%.
In these conditions, computes the European Commission, the public deficit will represent yet 4.3% of GDP next year, compared with 3.9 per cent by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012, instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumours of a new budget package that could be put in place after the holidays, to $7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will be taken," said the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment Italy has the support of international institutions.
'The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time ," assured Arrigo Sadun, the Italian manager of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"I have no problem in the immediate future, or for the short or long-term, for despite its substantial debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested to Italy are lower than those charged to other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political instability.
14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure to the Chamber of Deputies, which resulted in the early elections could be held in late March.
Will open then a period not conducive to the decision-making process in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think strengthening of anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde has again reiterated yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think it has demonstrated yet again Sunday in the day and into the night, of course, are united, determined, pledged to defend their currencies and their monetary zone."
Although relative, détente recorded yesterday bond rate of EU State has played right into the hands of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade the debt of Portugal, the target the more covered today speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack clarity and political visibility, that weighs particularly on the banking systems', believe economists to Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially as "the political time is much slower than the time the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers that it conceals, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis devices already exist.
Informal consultations between finance ministers the most directly affected and, more widely, with their peers of the G20 are going well.
And a view also meetings of Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone in the sights of the markets (see CI-above).
As the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors extremely-all-East developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of the visits is not to raise money, it is certainly the field.
The first emissions of the EFSF bonds are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support-a possible increase in funds raised by a more direct engagement from the IMF.
The frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to embrace structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which add to austerity measures to effect more closely.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different way from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both held at all costs to avoid having to ask for international assistance before establishing their own corrections budget and decide on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
European donors, finally, meet on the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of sovereign bond markets.
Crossing Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first put forward the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the European Union would not hesitate to put their hands on the purse.
Barclays Capital economists, a starring player market of European sovereign debt, feel a top-up of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of cash.
The vehicle exists: It is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, to date, 60 billion euros.
Counsel who was likely to be considered carefully in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions have flared up.

Grand Paris metro: Financial first outlines
Since the time that the debate around the modernisation of Ile-of-France is in full swing, the rains down billion.
In the discussion at least.
It specifically mentions 23 billion for metro Grand Paris that must build the Society of Greater Paris.
To kick-start that GSP, the state announced a capital adequacy of 4 billion euros.
In the conceptual design plan is the amount which will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets, a share of funding for its double loop.
Today, arriving finally the first additions.
Act budget-conscious 2010, discussed by finance committee of the National Assembly this morning contain the mechanisms set up to find the start of that money.
They are two: The creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase in the tax offices in Isle-of-France.
The first bed-it in the text of the draft law, Article 15, was' for the benefit of the public school of Grand Paris ."
It is shown, "the proceeds of the tax of 117 million euros a year."
The second is a redevelopment tax offices that already exists "to modernize, to increase the product and to allocate this increase the Corporation of Greater Paris."
How it would leverage?
A mystery.
That is not quantified in the text.
Is far short of the 4 billion.
"It is clear that this fiscal resources are in addition to the €4 billion of capital that will be raised by the state and made the Corporation of Greater Paris as' project, may-it read in the explanatory statement.
Was the GSP, it is not shocking this system.
"Had when it established the two revenue (taxes ndlr), it can cover the studies over three years and then bang in the 4 billion after, explains-t-on."
"That will be included in the Budget and fired as and when."
The GSP is estimated that 4 billion will start to be enrolled in 2013 to 2014 the budget.
The device, in which the 4 billion promised are still on hold, could lead to a parliamentary debate a little turbulent.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Carry hackers and spies in
WikiLeaks case has a double value.
To one side, it is apparent, a scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal before the hypocrisy which governs the relationship between the state, citizens and the press.
Another, it promises profound changes at the international level, and foreshadow a future dominated by the decline.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the confirmation that each issue constituted by a secret service (of some nation either) is composed exclusively of clippings.
The 'extraordinary' revelations on American sexual mores of Berlusconi merely report on what for months could read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the pattern was caricatural unnervingly Gaddafi a long-standing artists for cabaret skits.
The rule that the records secret compounds must be that new already experienced is the key to the dynamic of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a bookshop dedicated to publications esoteric, you will see that each facility again (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-the-Chateau, Templiers or Rose-Cross) exactly what is already written in the earlier books.
Not only because of the author not something secret texts of first-of-a-kind research (or do not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who are implacably opposed occultisme to believing only to what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism the success of Dan Brown.
Idem for the secret files.
The whistle-blower is lazy, and lazy (or minds) limited the head of the secret service (otherwise, it might be, that know-I, editor of Libération), suffering as true as what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
Then why the revelations on these records have-they made so much noise?
To one side, they say what anyone grown already knows, namely as embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and with the heads of states can telephone or a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their function diplomatic and, with the exception of a few small periods of representation, have transformed into centres of espionage.
Any spectator investigative film knows this, and it is only by the hypocrisy that it pretends to ignore.
However, repeat publicly violated the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place under a bad light American diplomacy.
In the second place, the idea that a hacker can capture any secrets the most secret of the most powerful country in the world has taken a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also the scandal does-it not so much in crisis the victims that the "torturers."
But come-in the underlying nature of what happened.
, Orwell time, one could conceive any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwellian the prophecy had completely proven since, which can control every movement through phone, every transaction conducted, visited the hotel, the Motorway taken and so forth, the citizen became the victim of the eye of the power.
But when the demonstration, as it is now, that even the secrets cryptes of power cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the report continued to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power control each citizen, but each citizen, or least the hacker - elected as vengeance of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power which no longer has the option to keep its own secrets may-it take?
It is true, said Georg Simmel already a real secret is a secret and secret (vacuum can never be exposed); it is true, too, that all say on the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel is effectively empty secret a secret, because of public domain; but reveal, as WikiLeaks, that the secret Hillary Clinton were secrets mean empty strip it of any power.
WikiLeaks did harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has made too wide to Clinton and Obama.
What the consequences will be of that wound to a very powerful?
It is evident that in the future, governments will no longer be able to upload any information - that would be reserved to publish on a poster hung up around the corner.
But it is equally clear that, with modern technology, it is futile hope to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing easier than to discover whether and when a head of state travelled by plane and approached one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future private relationships and reserved?
I know that, for the moment my anticipation is Scientific-fiction and is so romantic, but I am forced to think government officials who move unobtrusively in mail coach routes with uncontrollable, with porters that messages learned by heart or, at most, in concealing the few written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored with a single copy in key closed drawers: Basically attempted espionage of Watergate had been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology moves now in crab is-à-dire backwards.
A century after that the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, Internet has re-established a telegraph on son (telephone).
Video (analog) had made it possible for researchers in the film to explore a film not to not, going forward and backwards and by discovering all the secrets of the fixture, while now the CD (digital) do that to jump for chapter by chapter is-à-dire macroportions by.
With high-speed trains, will be in Rome to Milan in three hours, while plane, and displacement that it includes, you need three hours and a half.
It is not therefore extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques go back to cars on horseback.
A final comment.
The past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secrecy of embassies.
Has now, it has been those embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: How France quick fix its promises funding
One year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to examine the basis of promises of funding quickly released (so-called fast start funding and early) made by the developed countries.
Major bidouillages and the French were revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries have pledged to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised $7.2 billion over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million a year).
At the opening COP16, the EU has produced the great game to persuade its partners to the reality of its commitment regarding funding fast start: Report detailing the activities of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of leaflets...
Operation transparency is commendable and widely appreciated: Developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries should do the same, with the same level of detail.
The EU announcement having reached 2.2 billion in 2010, which is putting on the right path in respect for his commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, after the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is done without be to the detriment in official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France blocked the order.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
The European Commission, for example, seen as a reference the year 2009: The international funding are maintained, and she adds 150 million over three years in funding fast start.
Other countries chose references similar in terms of this year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
Contrast, France finds that the funding of all "new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
Otherwise said, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous years, and the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, total support of France to the countries in development could remain stable or even decline), it claims to uphold its commitment in underfunding "new and additional..."
Another critical element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule, and everyone chooses its calculation.
Some, such as France, that €1 paid equates to €1.
Course, this is hard to justify: The effort is not comparable.
Whether the use of loans can be justified for some investments which are cost-effective (often projects related to emissions reduction based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present the Euro that will be recouped as equivalent to one euro that is given... Any the most, should not be counted under its commitments that the cost of borrowing for the country both lender (the equivalent of a rate of interest).
But France did that do to such reasoning: It "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see document of the EU to check by you-same.
It is the only country in the EU to use if massively the loan.
Germany would requires to 46%, while Denmark, the Pays-Bas or Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
I.e., when the overwhelming majority of the European Union is putting €1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is similar.
Beautiful turn of happening-happening!
In summary, in funding fast start, France operates a double scam: The evolution of the action at the time and the other, on the reality of the financial help.
By spending that 36.1 million euros, she comes to believe that it is spending $420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
Handling of the Treasury (since it seems that has done the Bercy that arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other member states will continue to give in just?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely stupid...
Chapter of early funding is only a small matter, relatively short term, compared to the general discussions on the climate.
But there may be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hope that this will not be the case.
Nevertheless, it is essential to learn the lessons from that first year funding early.
First France may announce a change in the method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect its commitments and fairness with other EU countries.
But especially, France could move discussions on issues of long-term funding (other crucial chapter currently discussed): We will not be able to escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France may change his position to be as forward-looking on these stakes as it is on the other.
Hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
An announcement surprised on the 'fast start for France and on its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward with discussions.
Alert to pesticides by children meddled
A ten-year-old child consumed one-day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, the association (Former Générations Future Movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, who warned that its results "have no significant statistical value in the light of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problems addressed," purchased between July and September the foods normally eaten four meals and a snack in a day with a child of about 10 years, in the supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three dairy and 1.5 litre of water per day, as well as sweets, were discussed by laboratories to research chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
Stock of the trim is damning: 81 42 of which are chemicals that are carcinogenic and five possible or probable carcinogenic substances classified some as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disrupters (EP), according to studies of several agencies including the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our investigation that reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possible carcinogenic and / or EP is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea milk alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proved as carcinogens some as well as almost 20 of residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
Apples, imported from Brazil, a snack as planned by the study and submit traces of six chemicals with a fungicide yet banned in France.
Same for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
The steak minced, the canned tuna, and even the wand of bread and the chewing gum were littered with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For the dinner, the salmon steaks was most "rich " with 34 chemical residues detected and even the plastic base used to warm the food at the micro-wavelength was not free.
The final risk to the consumer that "cocktails of contaminants" is probably under-estimated ," according to the study.
NATO Europe Ecologie-The Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "address the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, an end to "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) referred the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables eaten in Europe, of whom 76 in cereals.
