A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the latter keeps the Brennan Center, for a myth by it reaffirms that electoral fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by the lightning.
The Republican lawyers have listed over 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules are on the voter turnout negatively impact.
In this sense, these measures partly undermined the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United States for the holding of elections in the Member States are responsible.
In this sense, the majority of American Governments has announced new laws since 2009, which complicate the procedure for registering or voting.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections of November 2010, involving 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States were listed.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced alone in 2011, that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, laws be shortened by this also the period for early voting, that legal void explains to register on election day as voters and citizens denied the right to vote, for the a court exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State voters demanded to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first State that has levied a such demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
In the last two years they promoted in 34 States legislation forced voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that US citizens opposed to Quebec do not have a universal identification card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million people eligible to vote have a photo ID issued by a government authority of its State.
In addition, five million new voters have in 2012 does not have a such card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to pay to obtain the required certificate.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans have 15% of persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age does not have the required ID.
This goes further still.
It is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by its establishment students who give voters are considered, which increased their votes for Democratic candidates, in several States.
On the other hand, same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations, who choose more for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no State for choosing has requested a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first State to introduced a such demand.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws, demanding voters, they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, favor the Democratic Party.
Moreover, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 laws in eight States, with which the registration was abolished by voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the general election of 2004 to to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of new voters has fallen 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
In addition, Republican legislatures in five other States have adopted legislation aiming to shorten the period for early voting.
2008 In Florida, for example, were 33% of voters who in advance have chosen, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of voters of the State in the general election.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of voters off, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, representing 76% of voters made only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters have contrasted himself vigorously the adoption of laws, restricting voter registration.
Several legislative proposals have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic Governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
Partly, you could limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted legislation requiring showing photo identification.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in States crucial for 2012.
A report of the Brennan Center 2011 shows that those States that have adopted this legislation make 171 of the 270 votes, which are needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in legislation on the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules are on the voter turnout negatively impact.
In this sense, these measures partly undermined the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be or not done?
The PSA test would in fact sometimes erroneous results with false negative and false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions, or.
This leads to greater hesitation of already undecided men for carrying out screening tests.
Should the test be or not done?
We have obtained the opinion of two physicians.
In studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups were so it is difficult to interpret this data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a follow-up after 12 years the probability of the formation of metastases is up 40% higher at 30, when no screening was done.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, when you have a direct relative, which already was suffering from prostate cancer.
There is a higher risk in African-American men also.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer, the aggressive and others who are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer must be made really understood the patient by the possible options are shown him which prostate cancers can remain untreated, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and you rather decide in these cases for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, no treatment occurs in many men, in which it recognized cancer, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them a treatment at progression of the disease.
With increasing precision to determine the criteria for a decision who should be treated and who is not.
Therefore, I recommend performing the test anyway.
It is but most important, to speak, to determine whether he should be or not be performed with his physician.
In cooperation with the international society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is not a panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk to get sick to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least to 50 %", emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of cancer to die by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of illness.
You seem the risk of breast, Grimmdarm-, rectum, esophagus, to increase pancreatic cancer and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends that you limit the consumption of red meat.
In excessive amounts, it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While a study found reducing the risk of prostate cancer, another rather showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was also still not clearly pointed out.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
Analyze the Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has attracted a certain prestige on last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson at nothing less than to the mechanism is involved, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And after all, it is the last particles, the existence of which from the standard model - predicted our best or "the least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - was still not observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson is predicted by the standard model.
In addition this seems new data to be confirmed, which were presented this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto, but lacks data to be completely secure.
We off that it is actually the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk, to deceive, however and we look to what it's about.
There is a necessarily inevitable law that provides that two objects can not be present at the same place in this world.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and not too try it because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really weird world, turns out, that also a such law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle, which States that two particles can occupy the same room at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state" with this "condition" on the whole, consisting of some of their properties.
Assuming physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens who are referred to as Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle good.
And move in the other bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they are in fact located at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the Web site of the particle adventure by the Berkeley laboratories (which is by the way absolutely amazing) in two groups: the Mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particle" by the spread of the great forces of nature and that the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be here but stresses that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this Chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "photon", which is the "Messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If indeed a particle with an electric charge speeds up or changes the direction, is the electromagnetic field exactly at this place "disturbed", roughly like a pebble which has been thrown into a pond.
An electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, etc.) resulting in this "disorder", and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of bosons "Carriers of the force".
Stable field
The same applies for the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that another field, the Higgs field "must be disturbed", so is this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much stronger than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies a bit similar to a frozen pond, which surface could be furrowed by a huge rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerators like CERN is necessary - the large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never by itself keep the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the other (such as by the way the photon) have no mass.
What can all this research now for "be good", asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are Moreover many physicists who ardently hope that such deviations are found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter has major shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, representing approximately 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, such differences were not found at CERN until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s the pioneers of the laser at the Bell Laboratories have not assumed that their work would trigger such revolution.
They saw further scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has been working in the Bell Labs invented us in which the laser in the 1960s was, and 1962 itself the first time line laser (the first were pulsed) developed - said already, that the laser at the beginning rather than a "laboratory"gimmick was seen.
Introduce themselves...
In addition, applications may arise also from all the instruments, surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed again in 1969 a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "Eye", and has brought a 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really never know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec discussed the sensitive issue of the Lebensendes recently with its Committee on "Dying with dignity".
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, it remains still much to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I got seven years," he said half heartedly in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, that you can be unprepared," he says.
The illness makes their work: an immense weakness prevents him from walking alone to the toilet and even to eat.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned to help the food.
Brave manages even to smile him and talking to him are around, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath with strangers.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he tells.
A few hours later, the team has found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that pisses a man standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person", take a step backwards, he noted.
Because according to more than one person working in palliative care, major events in the midst of this backsliding.
The patients, who are assigned to the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois, suffer all of cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them, with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., the worst fear, "deliberately and suffocation" to die is 89 years.
But due to the illness I got to know my children really.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have nothing more in life," she says before she will accept that to set up a mask you, that helps her breathe.
Guests still have a last visit her son, who came from Italy in the next few days.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois, it provides personal care and assistance with food intake with a group of volunteers.
The palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make the dying.
In Quebec, a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we consider the fact that one day we all will die.
Here, life under optimum conditions will continue, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
They have an oral care with brandy or Pepsi the dying according to your wishes.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have served a beer Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help care professionals and patients alike," reported care Director Nathalie Savard.
There is no tag like the other in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, which enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported well by his pillow while one encounters in his honor, died a young man for 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years are occupied", Dr. Christiane Martel tells worried.
53% of the patients hospitalized in the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have access to palliative care, i.e. to a treatment that will relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the society for palliative care in the greater Montreal more or less exclusively specialize in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this major shortcoming in Quebec health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto circulating signed mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe of prominent figures of palliative care as Dr. Balfour, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel according to the Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all have right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted to go to the euthanasia.
More recently, says I have seen it, a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without that it has adopted measures for their relief.
I fear that the patients want to die just because they receive no proper health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst forecasts doggedly until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, she broke off an arduous chemotherapy.
As I've told my oncologist that I'll stop treatment, she has replied me that she regret the fact that I have to give up the fight, she told.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses that there has not been held this request after their pain by a team of palliative care have been alleviated.
But clearly, it must be said that the palliative care in treating pain is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Director of the palliative care of society of home palliative care of Metropolitan Montreal, attract 8% of patients not on pain treatment.
At the end of life the doctors access often terminal sedation, which boils down to the patient either intermittently or permanently up to the time of his death to euthanize.
We can not do as if we do not perceive this page of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the ability to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose Schmerzen not be relieved, all say same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want that you euthanize me", but "I want that my pain".
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism fellowship Canadian Institute of health research.
Real estate scandals of large scale in Quebec
Officials of the highways, companies of the construction industry, they have a great "system" tell what every day fundraiser of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia, to know in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system breaks down, since it has taken drastic measures," quips Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Quebec and former head of police of Montreal.
The scandal was covered by him on the basis of a detailed examination of the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road construction work in Quebec, the Prime Minister had agreed to only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010", he stresses "would have saved alone the Ministry of transport a billion dollars in contracts", because some moved their instinct here to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has brought two Mayor case", he adds in the hope that it succeeds, "to show the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 launched, permanent, anti-corruption unit
Life in 2011 called, continuous anti-corruption unit makes great efforts with their auditors, locate, and analysts of the Government troops.
In addition the police of the "Marteau force" caused since 2009... that the "sewer cartel" of Montreal restrained going with the artificial inflating of the treaties
In recent weeks, she has made rushed raids and raised allegations of fraud and corruption against local elected officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is Mayor of a suburb.
Gilles Vaillancourt, who resigned from his Office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec, would be the next on the list.
He is suspected to have repeatedly accepted bribes in Exchange for public contracts.
Specifically indicted were engineers of Straßenbauamts incidentally of Montreal, as well as businessman of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zabala.
The latter has attracted attention by declaring the operation of the "system" to obtain public contracts to the Commission.
He himself has paid for several years standing Agent 3% of the value of contracts received in Montreal to one with the mafia in conjunction, which transferred the money to the Union Montreal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's Party.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s, by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) on provincial parties, especially on the Liberals unprecedented at the time in power.
He also confessed to have organized an illegal raising of funds for the former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, the costs of which have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, from the construction company golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to 736.000 dollars in Exchange for sewer contracts, whose cost he artificially swelled.
Other officials of the highways have admitted that they lubricate left by them artificially extent on invoices with false benefits by 30-40%.
Also, a broadcaster has accused the party of the Mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay that he deliberately has overlooked a shadow budget, which filled his coffers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay has resigned in early November what crashed Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, beating the alarm.
As Mayor of the Borough of Rivière des-Prairies, in the East of the island, she rebelled against the sale of Gemeindegrundstücks, 2010, that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% Of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which ultimately is carried, she says that she "takes a thread, which allows to understand the operation of the system continued from ants to stop the evil and to denounce the culprits".
She says that the process was "painful, but positive".
We are here to clean the wound, an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision need however to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean turn.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau noted in turn that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", is especially thought about the role of "elected representatives, who are about the tactics in the picture", if they were not involved in the scam!
In a proportion of 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this is only a weak ripoff of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to restrict the donations to parties, to $100 which would alter the situation according to him: "As long as the campaign spending are not strictly limited, dirty money in politics in circulation will be."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of parties: "we can not lower fall; by we are the things with courage to the bottom, we can reconstruct the House on a more solid foundation with more controls and laws."
If this story will damage the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, they took on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can tell it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I'm doing every day on their side progress.
The technical staff has also been much me.
These elements inspire me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the Centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Étienne I did always gradually progress.
Make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti is therefore advantage...
The new additions of this summer are accustomed to play games very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
As a result, that a player has to offer the forehead like me, and wants to give his best.
By the way much in terms of my playing position gives me of Carlo Ancelotti.
He is supported by co coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He can look back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I have had an encouraging discussion with him.
At that time, I had recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
Lyon took the place of the leader in the French Ligue 1.
But we lurk in ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important goals: we have qualified in this manner for the knockout stage.
What is the goal of the Association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
But we will have to talk with our word against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first our group before postage so that we can carry out the second leg of the knockout final as a match.
Can a big European club be of the PSG in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and get a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially the PSG gives the means for this undertaking to accept concrete forms.
It would be a great failure to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really to the heart, to get this title.
Last season we were close.
In may, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry them the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points master be...
But another team that has those of Montpellier, an even better season scored.
I believe that this year is the right thing.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux to the title of wrestling, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media too much by the PSG expect?
Bearing in mind what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that many of us expected.
We accept it completely.
If we win but with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and there is still something, what one can accuse us, which is somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could win never every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to make a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club which fails to qualify for the knockout stage for two seasons and also huge expenditure has made!
With regard to the invested sums believed lead you to the game break with 15 points!
This would mean that our opponents and the French Championship consideration would be left.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we may be the smiling winner a month and tell us that we have won it despite all the difficulties eventually.
The PSG seems to depend completely from the services provided by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that is called a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This inspires the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders around the world, also makes it possible for everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was me in the heart, to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, because my injury has prevented me to knock out some playing time.
There, I've seen things from which I strengthened went out.
Today I manage to make good games for the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in the Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and today we must create an exemplary behaviour on the day.
What opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying Group for the World Cup.
The coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by he had qualified us for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Represents the force on 16 October in Spain draw (1:1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Prior to this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
Bitcoin payments and sell without Bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and fees between the parties involved.
In addition, a political vision is tangible as so often in these technologies: the conviction that the current, crafted of Bank monopolies monetary system, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchanges such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers, around 200,000 transactions were recorded in the network.
Several thousand Web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later on dollars 2 before it has recovered today to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the Web site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive when compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest to do this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
She describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success" bit coin, "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits", which are used to move forward in a video game by playing win or buy (and sometimes also change back) can.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and edited every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositary of Rechnungsbuchs, examiner, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two E-Mail addresses in the form of an e-mail message.
With the only difference being that the user choose a different address for each payment can, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction related is electronically signed with a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
By using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that there are the traded Bitcoins in the invoice book common across the entire network of the public accounts.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers where the winner, which is a kind of interim central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a crushing of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file to a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
Add a number to it, before the whole "hacked" the computer "take" the new transaction
The goal is to find the number that results in a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is right.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to tricking two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) wants to pay same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the others will have no link, as have both different fingerprints.
The computer that initiated the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The outstanding Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionstel divisible, allowing some leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with each improvement of computing power is increased.
The life of the network had already ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The shared vulnerability affects not the actual Protocol", Pierre Noizat, has introduced just Paymium, which is a company to pay with real money and uses the network of Bitcoin is assured.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering by using this anonymous service.
However, cash also exhibit these defects.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse such donations.
Others such as the blog platform of WordPress they are accepted.
Recently Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir from the Weizmann Institute in Israel the invoice book analyzed and show that almost 80% of Bitcoins not in circulation.
A "mega sales" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, converted the Bitcoins in gold would be glad.
Pierre Noizat, who also is author of a book about this currency is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia is a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner maintains its identity and can remain so anonymous.
The system can be implemented easily with retailers, and the latter must install no new terminal or computer programs.
You must specify just an address that from a phone "can be photographed and recognized", specifies Pierre Noizat assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally-oriented systems are covered.
He predicted "it will take some time until Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,".
The ECB provides incidentally in her report, to assess various, regarded today as a high risk in case of success of this currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left its area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are likely to follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army is again taking possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people will decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished in particular the Afghan farmers as we viewed them as terrorists.
And even with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded and invalids.
The Taliban are foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
You want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions even when jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, will the latter be gone, if the Western countries are discrete.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have, watched from a hill planted with almond trees which was financed using French loans was carried out properly.
The truck flown by helicopters and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no influx of more of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and covered the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
Their accession to power was viewed at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants, overwhelmed by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are coming to power in 2001.
They have turned in traders have seized land of the Government to sell a plot of land to refugees from the Iran and Pakistan and moved to take advantage of the massive American subcontracting.
You have brought himself into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
I've heard it in the campaign, the people want a Government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who themselves could take advantage of the American donations: capital flight is substantial.
The young people are tired of the war and his ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls like boys.
You will have to available jobs these young people, who want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties, nor to the corruption of some executives.
All the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; the television with his Turkish series, representing a modern world is everywhere being viewed.
An army is now available.
Are the authorities under whose command she will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already strive for the restoration of the militia in the province that are beyond the power of the Central Government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities would have to benefit from a certain decentralisation on the example of the Western Nations, but through abolition of the Office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States made him wanted to make a centralized State with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzaï wants no foreign checks, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country is dependent on since the 1950s and long before foreign aid.
Industries were not rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation system were not repaired.
Everything is imported; Apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The priority is left the private initiative.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, would have been required to State control of infrastructure.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This strengthens even the impression that the Western countries only locally were of to seize.
Without energy, to consume the iron or copper ore on the spot, or no mining is possible without transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have already left the MES Aynak copper mine, let their excavations make the international archaeologists on the huge Buddhist Centre (funded by the World Bank) and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will be also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which imports and exports are largely dependent on, establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new agreement provides for the continuation of traditional AIDS: girls and boys schools, Institute for French universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of defence (CIMIC), which is set in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation "hearts and spirits to win" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions let to to try to achieve.
This works, for whom, many local workers were required, have can help to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir leave we EUR two billion to military spending?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions are often very hard in these at an altitude of 2000 metres over the valleys.
The Embassy arrived dozens written questions to small-scale agricultural projects by municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
So farmers free from the uprising led by foreign groups, what is your request according to their own statements, the continuation of low, well controlled and they directly affect civilian aid would be required in their favor.
A Constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration that temporarily grants him the unlimited power of Attorney, remains divided more than ever, he has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had granted this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt relies for almost two years now on a provisional, several times amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only caused a further split in the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic delirium" by still "breaks his word" and "is the law".
On pages of its proponents, we assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which forced the brothers to give up explain the text section by section the Egyptians on their projects.
For the President it is also a way, to find its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest throughout the country rages.
After affirmations in an interview with the US weekly time Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians are honored to vote.
Especially since an ultimatum will be the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my design or I keep the unlimited power of Attorney", the latter should supposedly take an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
yesterday 85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent Assembly adopted the text in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals is not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration mid-November they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able, to bring their points of view.
Representatives have been equally by human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society.
To achieve the quorum, morning in haste were added to 11 people, Deputy members, yesterday.
The Muslim brothers, some are very closely related.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted.
The commentators found it entertaining by the way, that the only controversy of the day... has come to the time for the prayer expressed as some members of the Panel of believe that the pendulum of the constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text that has been adopted yesterday evening still consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, remains ultimately identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The salafistischen parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped what would have made possible a stricter application to replace "the principles", with "the rules".
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed a proof for their goodwill and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow reciprocate "Hypocrisy".
Because according to them, is the Islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
They are especially articles 220 in the eye, which recognises a consultative role of Al-Azhar University, in particular as regards the examination of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is troubling because "those who prompted an opinion, are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy herein".
Fears the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next Rector of this University would be far less moderate than the present one.
"Currently no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text, are academics who have been trained in the French system for the part, not ulema"appeased Alexis Blouet, who writes a thesis about the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.
He admits, however, "that in relation to the article 220 ambiguity can occur, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It particularly refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. red.].
And in the future could be raised the question to what extent before a civil court is competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, yesterday adopted text is heavily criticized due to the far-reaching powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that compared are significantly reduced with the former regime.
A further point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military examination of defence is not the Parliament presented, but a National Defense Council.
As well, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have requested it.
The latter tell also their concerns in relation to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now banned, could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, refers more to the protection of women there is no article, underscores Heba Morayef of human rights watch.
In your opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday had to speak out evening on television, this afternoon demonstrations are planned.
The supporters of the head of State will March on Saturday.

The dead sea is even warmer and there is bathed year-round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a layer of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest located sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and easily wears even non-swimmers on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural brine) and mud, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and nerves strained to calm.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
The old town of Tel Aviv, that the city Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast holds these secrets.
This city was the famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
Traditions according to Noah built his Ark right here, and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, where he led a long and happy life in this place here.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members of Parliament and civil rights activist in discussing, what benefits it brings the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals Act already with fake certificates
Every year come 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the families remaining in the home.
On December 1, an Act entered into force which according to each migrant must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the municipal housing sector and retail.
However, the tests with time according to Federal Migration Office should be in future for all migrant workers mandatory.
Here you must play not only language tests but also tests in Russia's history and the basics of the legislation.
Language skills must be assigned to both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991 are exempt from this law.
Meaning, problems and protection of the rights
The whole of the examination bodies is the Russian University of people's friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities are under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian, language.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres were opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal migration service.
Civil libertarians, however, was before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what actually brings the whole thing?
What changes is the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and for the migrant workers?
First of all, say the migration authority spokesman, matter it to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many now speak about the protection of the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the representation of the federal migration service in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected prior to their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers 90%.
Migrants encounter problems without professional, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who stuck him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will hold out for months without food, and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day toiling with dozens peer to peer.
Many complaints by our migrants reach us.
"One is promised you in the home, and upon arrival you are scammed, get off their passports and receive not the promised reward," the Chief confirmed Head Office for labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not ranting, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics that want to make their money in Russia, to say that they can not control not only the language of the destination country, but hardly writing expressing themselves in their own language.
Of course thats not so much their fault, as rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone, them to buy decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activist stress following important aspect with regard to the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
You do not have this status there is no check and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile the bulk of migrant workers is still illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for unauthorized persons prohibited"
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
Bureaucratic hurdles and of course the language difficulties are the reason.
Also, the legalization costs money: 12 16 thousand rubles up to.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely falsified and we not registered are, and from it arise cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for buying cigarettes and tea," expresses the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Only spare no costs for false papers"
Already on the day on which the Act came into force, turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates, which certify the completion of the language tests were taken by employees of the Federal Migration Service fitting.
The fake documents were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course the new owners received it not in vain: every migrant, who hoped to be able to save yourself so the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs three thousand rubles a migrant workers.
Moreover, that is the most important immediate task is to protect the system so that the certificates can be bought not just against corruption both officials and civil libertarians agree.
For the moment the authorities can migrant worker remittances, falling for the first time through the test, promise only that they get time for a language basic course.
In addition, authorities in areas are offered newcomers without language skills where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low crime
The Russian Interior Ministry plans an intensification of the Firearms Act for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: wounded in shootings on weddings, as well as seven killed in the rampage of the Moscow lawyers Dmitri Winogradow.
The police will ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for acquiring firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the Chairman of the Duma Committee on security and fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, has supported and promised that the changes to the weapons law in the near future be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "Attraction of the screws".
An open letter was published in the Internet and whose Verfasser - representatives of various associations of weapon - by the authorities asking to refrain from "mindless restrictions".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is Vasiliy Lesnikow, the BBC's Russian service very low, the jurist said.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 were made, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period as a whole.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will hold criminals not to operate on the black market.
Currently, you can find the authors according to every possible weapon for very little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach across multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of education and the General staff.
Screenshot of a Web page that takes gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers, as well as the Caucasians itself both", says Baranez.
Illegal weapons are stolen by criminal police come on the second channel.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that were stolen from the armouries of the police as well as directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
More illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many military camps occurred frequently to explosions.
"There is evidence that it was in some cases to arson, to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Weapon manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez.
"Today there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken that not withstanding international competition and thus squander the weapons under the hand on the black market, in Moscow,", the expert reports.
Another channel of the black is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes small-scale production as well as a mafia, who organized the smuggling", explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels on the delivery of the black with illegal weapons has about.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for problem analysis and State administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal service of State statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons comes the investigators that by the army and the law protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are through there that "guilt by managers who do their work with weapons", it is said in the report.
According to the data of the research, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to thefts of weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
By a salesperson of of a weapon store, which will be named assures that long no one buys weapons that are found during illegal excavations, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common dealer to get the supplies in a weapons cache.
A weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought via an Ensign.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sells them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he tells
"The police know of course about and performs therefore, if she cannot keep up the plan to expose white-colllar crime, periodically at retailers control purchases offered by illegal weapons", adds the sales consultants.
"As in the luxury shop"
Most often, buyers and sellers find each other through acquaintances.
I had seen on Web sites and blogs I, as someone on me was attentive and suggested me to the station "Begovaya", where a person would wait for me, which led me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I was told the price of the weapon only
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"I need a friend who has contacts to get a weapon,", tells of the salesperson. "I have as an acquaintance, but I don't trust him".
There are traders on the markets, but there you must go and to arrange with a code like "by Iwan Iwanowitsch, which set out that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm currently on some knuckles over a friend who I trust.
He supplies me also just so the knuckles, because he knows that I be not whistle it.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military members Viktor Baranez tried mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this topic.
The schemas have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album, where "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets not the cat in the bag according to Baranez, but can try everything.
I don't just buy as a potential customer, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a bulls-eye.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop from your sofa
Internet search engines see search results to Web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons "for different purposes" are offered.
There are neither any papers needed nor is there in-person meetings.
"You need just the right amount money", it means "buy combat pistol or rifle" in the advertisement on the website.
There, users give up your orders and requests.
Is also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks users "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic question by"Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service turned on countless ticket Web sites recently, and buyers who want to buy weapons, go the service maintains in the network.
People like hungry fish feeding and then land in Siberia and are shoveling coal
Military commentator and retired military officer Viktor Baranez
I've heard from the following scheme: the Web page is usually registered in foreign countries, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those are the orders.
The purchaser will transfer the money via an ATM machine.
The spokesman of the non-profit organization "Response he receives a photo and a description of the space hiding place of weapons", "Pravo na oryzhie" reported Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also do at the end and come behind bars, if you place a request on a Web page.
The Federal Security Service turned on countless ticket Web sites recently, and buyers who want to buy weapons, go the service maintains in the network.
"People like hungry fish feeding and end up in a Siberian labour camp and allowed shoveling coal", he says.
A Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal firearms is to be expected according to experts, with prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the Organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a pistol of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arsenals of middle-level supervisors.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior the number of offences illegal weapons throughout Russia declined in the period from January to October 2011 at 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices 7.8% dwindled.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers go on strike
Every fourth American young people at some point sits behind the entrance of MC Donald's
In the last few days there was's, Burger King, Taco Bell, in the United States for massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald a Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further swell or whether them soon again the air runs out.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to improving the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is not unionized.
46 Cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when in the United States sales took place, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes resulted in melee.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are worldwide 2.2 million, laid down their work and bestreikten branches of the chain, targeting people of low and moderate income together with trade unions and left-wing activists.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores on average between 8 and 27% is cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only at own work shop.
Walmart made one of the largest companies in the United States the prices and the assortment of goods.
Critics say Walmart can sell often only therefore as cheap goods because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter complain about severe working conditions, such as missing fork or hand scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about that contribution for the in-house health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars was increased in the month.
A typical Walmart employee who is the hour earned 9.5 US dollars, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the hour increased the average wage to 12 dollars, 3.2 billion dollars would cost Walmart.
These are approx. 1.1% more than they now spend for wage.
Would Walmart have to assess wage increases completely on the customer, any purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for them compared to today spending increases of only 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart happy determine that protests occurred only in nine States and this brought the company any loss.
The Black Friday until the next day in his shop by 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday midnight, and during this period, Walmart sold approximately 5000 article per second.
Overall, the Walmart cashier on "Black Friday" led almost 100 million transactions.
Spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that "less than five" Walmart employee laid down the work and the protest had been merely 'another PR trick"of the Trade Union, which organized the protests,.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where however not Walmart stores (which are not desirable and therefore so far non-existent in this progressive city), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants were their objective.
McDonald's says the company sell billion servings, but it gives you no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Legislation is currently York the minimum wage under federal and new at 7.25 dollars hour.
Gradually, the minimum wage is however not too strongly, lifted in fast-food restaurants, and average their simple employees in New York City, 8.90 US dollars get the hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
It is incomprehensible to me how it is possible to come into New York with so little money.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people stood after school behind the counter at McDonald's, but the young people lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income in or planned to stay longer.
Now people who complain that they come out with this wage must feed sometimes even their children meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly.
On the other hand, there is in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal comment, whose Verfasser notes that it was irresponsible to have children, if you did not know how it is to feed them.
The participants of the protests called for on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began that the cashiers and cooks the hour get a minimum wage of $ 15 by fast-food restaurants, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage is equivalent to.
They also demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The American law prohibits corporate governance to this objective in the way and to urge Union members or dismissed.
On the other hand the management makes it not easy them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day well before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a gathering at noon before the McDonald's in times square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion servings, but it gives you no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also from other prominent New York Democrats supported mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said, for example, that "we should jointly the fast-food employee support, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry are engaged, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
Still is not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can trick themselves so far only modestly"
The theme popular among followers of modern technologies of augmented reality is commonly perceived in recent times through the lens of a special pair of glasses.
First, Google presented a working model in the summer at its annual Conference, in November it was announced then that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, shows however that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
Irritating to the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual spaces.
-Describe briefly what research your group operates.
-We deal with the interaction of man and the limits of this interaction want to expand machine, however.
So far is the humanity in the phase stuck, in working with pixels on flat screens, are sometimes affected.
However, we want to 5-10 look years ahead and foresee radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a leap forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because interested all for motion control.
-What can we expect in the future?
-Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, many things still on the flat screen takes place, sometimes in 3D.
The input information (the system gets more data) could be improved the output so far still not decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional presentation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have released the world of computing in our physical world and make them believe.
To do this, it is but you recognize not only the user but also its surroundings.
Then, we could supplement the real world with virtual objects much easier.
And first of all we should rid this crazy one virtual-reality helmets!
-What do you think about voice control?
She is popular, but it is not overrated?
-It is certainly not the all purpose solution because it raises questions about privacy, because we would like to inform not all bystanders about his actions and intentions.
Any kind of interaction with computers is actually good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked on a project where we were experimenting with short and tight, instead of using expansive gestures relating to the control of objects in public places.
While the gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a strap, which recorded the movements of the bone and muscles.
Still, it is relatively large, could theoretically but are shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But as a whole belongs to the future of however mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
-Like that?
-Would we ask me for example, to reach you with this bubble box?
You say it and pointing at the same time.
-Usually, I'll just say it.
-Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
— That is, you want that the user adapts to that, what can make a machine at the relevant time and what is not?
-Not necessarily, but it involves a mutual approach.
I think that we will work in the near future mainly to the development of new sensor types, that allow to gather reactions from people.
For example laser sensors can be, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
-Which claims do you starting from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors in modern cameras?
Lacking resolution, depth, or anything else?
-The present generation is a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection basically.
Of course, 8 mega pixel at a speed of 1000 would be not bad fps.
But not the mega pixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth are the main thing.
Seen in this way, all current technologies for us are not good enough, because the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be considered not only the resolution along the x and the y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second is important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and quite frankly, too little the current 30 fps for gestures.
Stephen Betishes has developed a touch sensor with an adjustable delay of processing between 1 to 100 milliseconds, in our laboratory in Redmond where the today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this will affect the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed as a device, just no touch controls and more frames per second.
-Should the number of cameras does not increase?
-Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", where one actually an infra-red transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It serves not to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem because more calculations would be needed.
A flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to determine how this helps us in determining three-dimensional, a position would be nice.
-If I remember correctly, Microsoft presented in contrast to Google his glasses not the public.
Don't you think that, with regard to the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses has the best prospects?
-Of course, it is not pleasant to keep on the move always a Smartphone in the hand raised, but I think the following: the best variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we could toggle through a cloud of spectacles on the Smartphone,
The glasses is a personal gadget and their strength lies (only you can see private), but also their weakness that prevents an augmented reality through glasses that you can work together with others on virtual objects.
-We imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark from iron is accessible to, but also mere mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
The answers will your group to this objection give?
-In my lectures, I speak often of the augmented reality to represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method currently is to use the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection surface.
It is excellent pressure!
There are also technologies that are actually designed to give something tangible "Images in the air", for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound beams into a certain point where the finger is located, creates a feeling that is at the moment but still so weak, as someone on the palms of the hands blowing.
There are also tapes for the wrist, which have an effect on the nerve endings in your fingers, this is a potential direction.
-Have you tried to trick the brain?
Think it can, that it feels that what should feel it when it sees something?
-This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here is another task that we long to fight will have, to believe someone who is physically located in a confined space, namely, he possesses virtually infinite space; instead in an open, Here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can be only moderately trick, and there are still many busy years ahead.
Just what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so appealing: in many areas, we are only at the beginning.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", which is dedicated to urban dwellers who make up the vanguard of art and culture.
Already senior officials of St. Petersburg art scene, whose success go beyond the borders of the city, and which often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia landed on the fine list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, the Red-clad bearded, which can be found at the Russian Museum, times in the summer garden, times at scene-meeting or exhibitions.
Where the images are also issued by Kirill Miller, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and In the early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile in the face of his fellow citizens through its presence on the street, and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently, he snapped a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg barrel organ player, because he felt finally ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist General, his philosophy and his image.
-Why are you Kirill, always red and not for example yellow or turquoise in the city on the road?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between the artist and image consultant company.
Everything is different some of the grey standard, aggression and bad behavior causes in society.
But, I want to come through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
-When did you know that you need to become a painter?
-At an exhibition in the Palace of culture of Nevsky of my works were exhibited.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then went to the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painter at that time to end, and new and free painter like me were incomprehensible.
I befriended me with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of "Gazonewschina"; This resulted in "Pushkinskaya-10", and then was once.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to the music, actually everything except for the literature.
And all this combined is in your kind clinic... - it was important to stand, where the best creative artists should gather in the center of St. Petersburg culture.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical artistic Club for the Bohemian, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians to the renovation work.
Many were there born: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember also, as cord came with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight uniforms and also the today featured composer Igor Wdowin belonged to them.
As the Group began to play, live her "Leningrad" was taken.
Trachtenberg hosted many programs ahead of time "Halli Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The Gallery "D 137" or the Club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
There went our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In the year 2000, there was a poll, which dealt with the award of "Personalities of our city" in the press.
I won in the category of "Artist of the year", and thus I had arrived at the peak.
It is not easy to work, according to old rules in new times I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without thus make a cultural contribution.
-Your works have a distinctive style.
-Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the freshness and sharpness of thought.
I am going to have an exhibition with the theme of "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and is afraid to do so.
In a clown, blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
We can save for example the world by we prescribe that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and focuses on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps may be not the hand a person, but should it have to spit in the face.
The illusion disappears through the dressing.
-More recently, we saw you in the role of the municipal organ player. -A city of culture should have as a hero.
Who, if not I?
-Can and commercial art be beautiful?
-Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of civilizations.
Earlier, the people formed large groups: Bohemians loved the other one and the common people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred dollar bill, which pleases everyone.
Now you need to think about you, you'll like who.
Now, every cult star has about 100 followers.
-Several thousand come to the performances by Stas Michailow but!
-Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand come, hence there is less management, money, and everything goes based.
I have followers, and the important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures hung at a collector even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I began with images, which usually come at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It's called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, this is something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture that I am in favour of.
-Petersburg Kirill, what's missing?
-Good culture experts.
It is said: servant of the culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
At the real Tsar, it was different, because the Czars understood much of culture perhaps, but they understood that right experts are needed.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In Petersburg, we have that the experts might be, but them is blocking the way, as it hochrangigerer experts who correctly evaluate the former and pave the way to them.
Now counts only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all must accept contemporary art and some painters are looking so other museums.
-Petersburg what is for you?
-Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there are much more culture and an appropriate medium.
On our stones, art can grow difficult.
We need a cultural medium, because for example, we have now more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people, the exhibitions or attend concerts.
We are much less.
Art has to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded from grants of the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are on the search for a substitute planet.
To save the mankind, is the important question of how we us can breed in space or on the spare planet?
There is not many choices in my opinion.
De facto, there are only two real planets we might inhabit at least hypothetically.
The scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Wladimir Surdin says ", namely Mars and Venus".
While the conditions on Mars comparatively are enjoyable, however, a temperature of 500 degrees is on the surface of Venus.
Life would be possible only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, at all.
The researchers treated the question of reproduction in space first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century earlier experiments with plants were performed.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit differed not at all of the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), into the orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It developed into a normal chick.
But then the trouble begins.
The problem "is that the chicks must find support It must can stand on its feet and begin to move,"explains the head of laboratory of the Institute of medical biological problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without solid base the chicks fought over wild.
Ten hours later the instincts of newborn blunting completely.
The chicks responded not to light and sounds.
Four days later she died then.
"Twice we let slip chick and then set the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew maintains the failed experiment with the chick at all.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments are continued in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be located on the Biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were sent already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found here.
"That was just with the Biosatellite, but it was again just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Wladimir Sychew noticed.
After landing, the space rats got young.
So far, it could not solve the problem of reproduction in space.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat, can not just follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb.
Unlike animals humans might be in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not performed.
However, women fly for 50 years in space.
The greatest risk occurred with Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that has humanity, is the female organism.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one would have to answer the following question on Earth: it survives the spaceflight?
She can bring a child after this flight to the world?
"Eventually, no one answered this question", says space veteran Vahtang Watschnadse.
The first female Cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter gave birth to in June 1964, only a year after their spaceflight.
The father of the child, ANDRIAN Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who twice was in orbit and performed even working outside the spacecraft, a son gave birth to.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more it is more dangerous even for flights into orbit", concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must search for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory at the Cosmonaut preparation Centre is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a State of limbo, the cosmonauts win routine for working in open space.
The water provides weightlessness.
Even though adults find water, it's a foreign environment; However, infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander would drop testimony that life on the land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months is in the mother's womb in the amniotic fluid, and that it can adapt more easily to water.
In principle, this makes sense, because from birth up to the first swim just take 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, the weightlessness that is a much more natural condition, the woman without gravity comes out.
In a State of weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles regresses very rapidly and thus decreases the ability to squeeze out the child.
Oh well, we bypass that by birth-introductory resource.
The birth could occur for example in a Special Chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?", is the not insignificant matter of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity of Earth, the organism can not make out the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child can be placed in orbit not as an adult for training in a pollution suit.
That is simply missing him is for his life of fundamental importance.
The head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of medical biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow, "This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead, we will bring a disabled, a completely non-aligned people to the world" predicts.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point it becomes reality but when break Earth dwellers on their ships to a distant planet, which is the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ-Chef: Control of the black system failed due to fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has good control and appropriate laws relating to public contracts, but falls back into their application.
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz the highest control Office says this Miloslav Kala (Nejvyšší Kontrolní urád, NKÚ), Vice President.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly and this is not the case in my opinion with us", Kala commented on the current situation.
Apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditor comes to a similar conclusion.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black"System.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would harass the entrepreneurs do not use controls - is the system so now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must however have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the Government Chairman can not just come, and interfere with the Control Board, which required is the control of the compliance with the law, in his occupation," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, whereby the laws of both countries of concerning public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it that specifically?
It is a parallel test, where we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it comes to the European legislature sets out how public contracts are to handle. Build on the national legislation. And finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all this, and although the review is not yet completed, we find very interesting differences. The laws in us are generally, maybe even more "strict and perfect", the actual application but is better in Germany in some of the parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project be you help? What emerges for you from this project?
Just such joint control could help that we cease to strive if apparently not especially positive effect to a perfecting of the law and the reduction and balancing of threshold values.
Economic efficiency means to purchase something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for contracts not guaranteed that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we stress the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, have it much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher.
Talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the NCU has the General Accounting Office, which is similar as ours and also a college which is made only slightly differently. Basically, both agencies work but similar.
Also the skills are similar to a certain extent, with Germany however is a State, i.e. that there are these courts in the individual federal States - it, the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can control only federal funds, which corresponds to our State resources.
There, public funds administered for us by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the regional court of audit.
As regards the German legislation, which is easier than ours?
Generally, I would compare this reluctant without specific details. Nevertheless Germany is often referred in some respects as a model, whereby one but definitely not can say that Germany is better in all.
Is this perhaps because that the inspectors are there better?
Determined not, but as I said: I do not particularly like like such comparisons.
For this purpose, it is noted that those countries that are a model for us, have also to deal with problems.
Would otherwise not true they have nothing of a collaboration with our authority?
Regards the Czech legislation, what the proposed revision of the public procurement law, had for your authority you feel have any impact?
Considering that this amendment is in force only a short time, she not affect so far yet during our tests.
Because our checks subsequently take place, you can expect some delay here.
We now in preparation for future controls feel impact - so we have introduced the new monitoring tool "Detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this considered almost 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here the changes will affect of course, modified as the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of alerts have been
Rather positively see the passage of this law, or the system with another bureaucracy will be charged?
I think that this Bill is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
It can however occur the problem, that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be kept.
Already under the previous rules are assessed a checking persons compared to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable so that any non-compliance with the procurement law is a violation of budgetary discipline.
It makes sense but then to make even stricter the law?
My opinion in this way.
The system must rule out those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not punish those who have committed an irregularity, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system is merely the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
Say, first of all, what way is inexpedient.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would bother the entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called "black system" - what does this mean exactly?
The black system is now prohibited or allowed?
A law must however have its validity, and if something is illegal, the Government Chairman can do not just come and interfere with the Control Board, which required is the control of the compliance with the law, in his occupation.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", but he can't say that we will do so, as if nothing could be.
The law contains relatively strict rules about the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic, if the bidder with the best bid solely on the basis of irregularities will be excluded.
The law will be never perfect, but it must be applied properly and thats what I think is missing in us.
Frost there is scattered on the streets, they are mostly but dry.
Some snow and ice is on the streets of in the Czech Republic.
The streets are mostly but easily passable, sometimes, increased caution is advised.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary of district of, the streets were today tomorrow easily passable, occasionally there was snow and black ice.
Temperatures fell to-5 to-10 ° C, during the day, it should be slightly warmer.
In the region it's snowing now no longer, and only a thin blanket of snow remains in the lower elevations.
But about 30 cm are snow on the ridges of the Ore mountains.
According to the District Road Watch, limited visibility was due to fog.
Expressway R6 and the routes of the first class of road in the region are currently fully accessible.
Attention is however, for example, on bridges, where the roads are smooth and sometimes iced.
Also all roads of the second and third class of road, including the mountain roads are passable.
However some sections of icy or extended snow remain on these streets.
Therefore increased attention is in particular at the higher elevations.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia, there is a risk due to frost at higher elevations and in the mountains, sometimes even an extended layer of snow, is located on the streets tells the road and motorway Directorate on its Internet pages.
The more alert driver before Frost, which can occur particularly at higher altitudes in the Pardubice.
To frost, it may in particular on roads of the second and third class of road in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Vysoké Mýto, Polička and Svitavy come.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Especially on the streets in the giant mountains and the Orlické Mountains mountains there is snow.
An extended layer of snow is located at altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is today mostly sunny or overcast, and it remains largely overcast.
The temperatures range between 3 and a light wind blows it + 1 ° C,.
Pilsen region
The streets in the Pilsen region are today easily passable, locally, but attention is required, and the driving is to adapt to the weather.
It is chilly in the morning with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before temperatures fall then, there may be ice on the streets.
Locally, it is also fog can be expected, where the view will improve but in the course of the day.
These figures come from the District more.
The D5 motorway is practically fully navigable, the more recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131 km.
The tracks of the first class of road are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the South of the districts of Plzeň and Tachov can occur but some sections to frost.
The roadways of second and third class of road are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area of Šumava.
District Olomouc
Drivers can expect slush today that are traveling in the direction of the altitudes in the district Olomouc.
After the use of Streufahrzeugen, slush on the pass remains Červenohorske sedlo and kříž on the road in the direction of Videlský.
Nightly snowfall the more forced Šumperk to use, in the District of about 3 cm fell according to road administration of fresh snow.
In other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully navigable.
"Šumperk in the District still remnants of snow remain in the high altitudes."
On the pass Červenohorske sedlo riders in the direction Jeseník must reckon with slush", an employee said the road administration Šumperk today ČTK to the Agency.
Their colleagues in the District of Jeseník were out at night, according to their statements, the streets are free at the altitudes after chemical treatment and wet.
In the District of Olomouc, the streets are fully accessible, in the District of Šternberk need drivers but proceed with caution forest sections, because here the surfaces are still wet.
District of Ústí of nad Labem, Liberec of district of
In North Bohemia, the more log several poorly navigable roads.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice after Knínice district Ústí N.k. is locked according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain in the lower elevations below zero, so that is will keep snow and ice on the roads. From the lowlands, especially Southeast of the Bohemian central mountains are reported no problems, however, and the streets are usually dry.
So far, no traffic incidents are reported.
Frost is reported from the District of Štěti.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions - day rain and melting snow, in the clear night sky and frost do this at night.
The main lines as well as the road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n.l. and Liberec bad traffic conditions are reported.
Blocking the road between Telnice and Knínice was required because of branches, which were pressed by the snow load up on the road.
Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about it, that the end of the world to take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we love to jump on people.
With our Band The Tap Tap, we make us more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world to stop or prevent.
In December, you also realize a unique project with three concerts to the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project our readers?
It is a national charity event which we plan to two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar which end is forecast for the December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on December 20, take place from 21:00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be approximately at the time of the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone to 12 hours ahead of us.
Who does this idea come from?
Probably originally from me, then we have designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Here we want to collect not only sufficiently positive energy, to prevent the end of the world, but we wish to think together with the public about what state we once passed this world our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, bags, and key fobs to the end of the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people also can support us.
The Band The Tap Tap has recorded also the so called hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world is" along with other performers.
Today, the anthem on YouTube is very popular. Will she sound on the benefit concert?
Of course, assuming, right at the end, that all goes well and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem to be sung at the same time by all performers in all three concerts.
Also, the hymns are live transferred together in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also collaborate with other personalities of Czech cultural scene, which connected with it, that we realize many fundraisers and concerts...
We strive to incorporate these people intensively in our projects.
While that most cooperating are interested in us and have fun doing it turned out.
Benefit of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world to what purpose?
The establishment of the barrier-free training centre Studeo, where we already six years together with the tap in the Jedlička Institute work.
The student of the Jedlička Institute is regularly serviced by editors which help with different activities.
Since students do not have the resources, in order to find the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
A separate building is to be in part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute in which we then insert this project.
Several groups and performers appear at every concert.
What criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support read biens, Illustratosphere occur with the Tap tap, Marián Bango, Dan Bárta and Jiří Suchý.
You will learn everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Planned are similar "major events" in the future?
In May we encounter for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we want to occur like House in New York City in Czech, and I personally - if we are then ever in the United States - would combine like this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not exactly small, so far have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the tap tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these visits logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage compartment. In addition we must carry of course many instrument suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless it has worked out so far without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were prepared very well on us, I've wondered sometimes partially already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By your traveling abroad you have a comparison, it looks like in each country, with accessibility, how there dealing with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything works better than ours, we were witnesses that in the East still everything in its inception is now in Russia.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicap-accessible. There, it is still uncommon, when someone in a wheelchair in the city centre alone on the road.
It is there, not even granted that it leaves a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, clubs, attempting to point out the problems of people with disabilities arise there.
And how must we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things where we afterwards hang...
For this purpose, it is still noted that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common, that even people with severe disabilities independently move in public space, go to the Museum, toilets, etc. can use
It is common but not exactly that it is there a larger group of people with disabilities that are actively involved in social events, we are ahead a little the West with the Band The Tap Tap!
Respect among the public and accessibility is one thing, but only coming from our ranks major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The tap tap is currently very popular. If we go a few years back: what you in the year 1998 to motivated, to form a band?
At that time I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested to deal intensively with something.
And since I myself am a musician and including play saxophone, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time is, likes to say as our Facilitator, Láďa Angelovič, somewhat out of control get (laughs).
Known, but it was the band in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation has helped us with famous singers In addition we have also started, to actively advertise for us.
Us has become aware that if one does something and not to see this outside, its own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU funding we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment and etc. do.
Was it your goal to get it with the tap tap?
From the outset, I have felt the potential that you can do things differently.
In show business, one now much copied the other.
This is logical in its own way, because everything new with caution is considered and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that include tap tap.
The first impression the viewer usually has, of course, is compassion; This is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned creatures, that we would regret.
There are people who can live a full life and develop, provided that they have the necessary means.
I always say that something if people with disabilities, this is a step forward not only for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful that you are a strict boss, as one hears from many people for this success?
If you would like to do something good, you can make any compromises on many things and must demand a certain discipline.
This is my opinion but perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have twice a week sample preparation phases must complete, and spend much time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm many goes out quickly.
So it works but everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, the tap tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, i.e. Since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open Group. People come and go. You cannot avoid that.
Who has the will and the desire to participate, is always welcome.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 to 21: 00
Venues include: Incheba arena/Prague, Fléda Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are interconnected to the end by going live and sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "Is end of the world" the Band the tap tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multi-functional disabled training centre, that STUDEO should be named in the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
The entrance fee is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week Poland was taken up as the twentieth member of the Space Agency ESA on a ministerial meeting of Member States of the European Space Agency. Poland is the second country from the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was on November 12, 2008 member of the ESA).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in several ESA projects.
The Poland's path into space started however much earlier.
Even before the second world war, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte engaged in the space where they were not always understanding.
I remember, for example on the lecture by A. Šternfeld from December 6, 1933, in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to the cosmopolitan".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) were cold the audience however, and after years remembered Šternfeld still, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld Hirsch won the donated Prix REP-Hirsch in 1934 for "Input to the cosmopolitan" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie, and André Louis.
Later, Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important advocate of astronomy and Astronautics.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was recognized among other things as a result one of the craters on the far side of the Moon is named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway trolley was built in Poland, for which a rocket was planned.
The author of the design and the details of the project remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the trolley.
The information, come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi led the research.
The surviving documents should be clearly marked that the research was penetrated in the stage of practical tests.
Research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937 the originating from ING. Rohoziński design of a photoelectric hunt rocket appeared in the trade press, and in the following year the work was published "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" Leliwa Krzywoblocky author.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocketry from the temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy) were coordinated.
The Committee was set up in 1937, his work was completed after two years of activity, but by the start of the war.
More article space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is carried out in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy are dedicated to four extensive article of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects for the satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956 the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951 founded International Federation for aerospace, and indeed the PTA member was already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International was Federation space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated substantially in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later built an improved version, the RM-1A, and in 1959 began in the Błędów desert of flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and are used for the observation of altitude.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
Successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the Meteor-1 rocket developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed by this missile (Meteor-1A, - 1B and - 1C), that the size of the space for scientific instruments differed from each other.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport capacity with 0.4 liters, Meteor-1 (B) 0.34 liters and Meteor-1 C over 0.62 l.
The maximum flight altitude was in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the Aviation Institute, whose initial flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a takeoff weight of 380 kg, and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 miles.
Then the versions were Meteor-2 H and Meteor-3.
Worth mentioning is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for space research) followed in the year 1960, on the two years later the establishment of a National Committee of COSPAR.
Poland participated in the INTERCOSMOS programme to space exploration with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, Vladimír Remek was second inter Cosmonaut after the Czechs.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision provoked a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies into a permanent conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
This term is a condition to understand where the manufacturers tried to pass by it "undercuts the competition", thereby to seize a larger market share in itself and increase his profit by imports of cheaper goods in economic competition.
On a large scale, for most companies, to buy there cheap or to relocate their manufacturing abroad, or to abandon their business but this means. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital no social responsibility and so bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, spending rise necessarily.
This situation is exacerbated that men entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace the society-wide economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics on this point are unnecessary.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which the Governments be compelled with each other to compete artificially reduce the social level of its own people and to lure foreign capital into the country in the various economies.
In other words:, Governments provide its own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This manifests itself in changes of laws.
The aim of these measures is its own people to force to accept the dictates of the private sector especially in the wage area.
This is a through economic coercion to long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of the rights of workers.
Growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor are the result.
In Germany, there are public food drop-off points for the arms, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for several years.
The number of those affected is already going into the millions.
In the course of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it comes regularly to cases where employees receive a wage so low, that the State must increase their income up to the subsistence level.
A such scandal was revealed even in the case of unskilled workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU Southern certainly tantamount to the same State, in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level are forced to emigrate (as it was the case in the 19th century), or left to languish for a pittance at the margins of society, and hope that at some point private investment capital in the country will go sure.
Here arises the question naturally, from whence comes this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, moves only the poverty from one country to the other; or the capital remains out immediately, as in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africa at all the employees for a fraction of the wages of European work.
This applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim nauseam that the State not with capital must be involved on its own economy, and that economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital narrow-minded insists on its position that the State may not directing work on the economy.
Then one must wonder but whether private capital not affected the policy and thus the entire State in terms of own selfish or even directs.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all States lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual immediately, a legislation, practically in all criminally, but nothing is a criminal offence.
In Germany, the situation is so that a State Ministry due to lack of finance commissioned private law firm entwined closely with industry with the drafting of bills.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer by the people from how the Western Constitutions proclaim it, but of powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously advised the liberal democracies currently quickly in a situation such as Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic to times of Julius Caesar and Pompey's describes: "the State was already for a long time in the fall, and the offices were filled by violence.
Against bribery, by unlawful cheating benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption proliferated uncontrollably, and the people went with purchased votes to the election"... "People with character not applied for posts, so that the State as a result of this decline had no Consul for eight months"... "It started really to talk about, that the only medicine in this dire situation is a one-man rule, and that a strong man must be chosen"... Appian was thinking about this while Pompey, but Cäsar, who permanently replaced the democracy with the autocracy was the strong man finally.
As it turns out today's society as well as in ancient times based on the ruthless preference of the own advantage, irrespectively of societal interests.
Private capital by its very nature is not in a position to recognize the benefit to society as a whole and to enforce.
The result, today as it was then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who seek in-depth reforms in the slightest.
We must seek the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state, the downfall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies as a certain pause can be viewed, in the next round already looming.
The fact that today's elites are the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, witnessed we are already, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and newer history, in perfect ignorance towards is particularly disastrous.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is here no solution, at least not permanent.
Czech Republic will be forced under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
Targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the State of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the State is the only solution.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"... nothing of violence arises, or could ever be" sting sings in the song fragile, whose most important vers in the refrain is: "...damit we not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons wanted no war, there would be no", says the dying Gutele second, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1849
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip there were a myriad of reactions, as always.
The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while she described the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the State of Israel, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs and refer to the State of Israel as terrorist.
I want to write at this point not, sacrifice is in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who; ultimately the current inhabitants of Israel including the self-governing areas in the current political situation were born and have never experienced even the beginning of the violence.
I am about to open the look behind the scenes at the readers, the look, whom the tension of 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partially based on available historical facts, but are derived from this and emerge from my own understanding of who or what group influenced the events of the modern history of people.
The history of mankind is a history of the struggle for power in the first place.
In every era, we can make out an Alexander the great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious, is the question of whether there were really getting these individuals themselves, which autonomously determined their steps, or whether her throne someone was behind, who brought their deeds to a predetermined target.
We must acknowledge, that we live in a time where the wealth of the world in your hand less individual focus, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power not within the lifetime of one generation was born.
Under this astronomically rich family one which stands out particularly, could be described as the head of the Octopus (I don't know whether anyone stands above them, I do not exclude but this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about it.
Understandably.
The first News Agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century, to prevent the connection of its name with high criminal acts in the background was always the consolidation of their power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks, and they fight wars against the countries in which they are not involved in banks, or prepare them (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on the Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall, Qadhafi remained only four, while Russia has assumed its Central Bank of the Russian Government in the meantime).
Who has ever tried to oppose this family had to pay with his life for that.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild Bank of America as the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (say: State) to issue banknotes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
J.F f. Kennedy began to issue their own banknotes and wanted the FED abolished - he was assassinated in 1963; the members of Parliament Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED due to triggering the great depression in 1929.
The global power cravings of the Rothschilds led Spades, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan to the unleashing of three world wars by Albert.
The first war had aimed to eliminate the large monarchist State being in Europe, especially Britain's colonial rule should be broken through the war, and the third war is to reduce the world's population on about 0.5 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and their luxury and would consume not so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing here more than the apron), and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method with which the Group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top, is triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are but false and always lead to the aggravation of the situation (see founding the FED so that crises such as those of them not repeating thrown in 1907).
After succeeded them by the murder of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo, to trigger the first world war, she destroyed the Russian Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer required for the destruction of the Russian Empire), then the resolution of the Central European great power of Austro-Hungarian Empire took place.
To spark the war easier, the banker by the policy could create a latent conflict, they occupied Germany with huge war reparations; as a result, they created the condition of impoverished masses so that they the Germans had to cheer, only a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; Another factor was the creation of the multiethnic State Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should have the function of a fifth column and also took, to ignite the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement at a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish State, as far as possible on the historic region of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital of (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; It came to first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether is now Hitler ripped off from the chain, at the international bankers had thought initially him, or whether all ran, is difficult to assess in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as through war reparations against Germany was prepared the ground for the second world war, the Declaration of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the third world war.
If it will succeed the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people is this time together with the Arab or Muslim populations of the Middle East similar to as in the second world war to the victims in the front line of the battle.
Israel is a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country as a giant laboratory, itself, but also internationally (just think people in trailers just how hot are and opponents of Israel's divide).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice throws only injustice in an endless spiral of violence, which at the beginning was the greed of individuals and their aspirations for global power?
One must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its leadership here, put but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Hawk of Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism-prone international bankers of loyal devoted politician who does everything to ensure, to ignite a war with the Iran, which quickly spread in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), a global conflict it could, and because of Iran's control of the only 2 miles wide Straits of Hormuz, about 20% of the global oil supplies could run, come to the destruction of the world economy.
Appear as the words of David Rockefeller's in 1994 in which light: "the only thing we need is spanning crisis everything, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocracy is used.
A world in which a chip is implanted every newborn at birth to subdue this essence of total control.
"And it makes that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, he had the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name alone.
Here is wisdom! If you have mind, that considering the number of the beast.
Because it is a human number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film ARGO: when's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of who Islamic students occupied the American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had maintained the patronage of his regime over the decades.
For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because this would massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
She was not at the same time able to push through the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime resulted.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco of the violent attempt of the hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations were arranged by the Algerian Government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti Iranian moods at home.
The debacle in the Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small partial victory ARGO of Director and actor Ben Affleck.
Six embassy employees immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy managed to escape.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
Succeeded to the CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from the Iran; helped them an extravagant story to mask their true identity – they travelled with Canadian passports masquerading as members of film staff who allegedly visited locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
He developed plan necessitated the cooperation of Hollywood by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez.
So the camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real Office.
The details of this operation were kept in long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Monkey leaks film is a special combination of multiple film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic thriller but also a so-called "caper movie", i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the film ocean's eleven.
Thus the mood levels turns in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs are shown in the title sequence, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that ironic and slightly exaggerated so come.
And then there are still scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, the Office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed a remarkable restarting of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respected Director and as an actor he no longer is the aim of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film after the crime no brainer (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city no mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is monkeys leaks first film not playing in his native Boston of directed.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place among the features that took off the previous films of this Director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in ARGO, where Tehran "is played by Canada".
The best scenes in the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the Embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere once yet.
A similar effect achieved Affleck with his team even when fictitious scenes (the wrong film crew at a Bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot, too many places
The Director had to grapple also, that history offers not many really exciting scenes in terms of cinematic.
With the few he works but quite successful, where he sometimes helps the reality - which then not always so elegant effect (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America is averted, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat contrived).
The weakness of the ARGO is its too wide dispersion that is caused by the need to show too much story to many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staffs but very charming, had their figures but deserves more space, and so they are by far not alone in the movie.
Monkey leak film loses some traction. It is a movie, you can follow and appreciate doing the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70's with some interest.
However difficult, he stirs passions.
As a reminder of a piece of living until today in some way history and as proof of how covered but the ideas of the Almighty and all-knowing intelligence services, it is however sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year gets a poll about the most absurd charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the plan put forward recently by the European Union to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies brought us," said Patrik Nacher, which deals with the Organization of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice about the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women is located under the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women for life insurance enjoyed an advantage because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU may be nominated by the end this year.
The actual voting takes place until end of February 2013 ", after communicated.
The binding incorporation of bioethanol for fuels include the controversial EU regulations, which consequently damaging nature is banning the reliable Mercury thermometer, just because they contain a relatively small volume of this dangerous substance, or the directive to the size of chicken cages, because of the eggs were much more expensive this year, also.
Criticism was also the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butter spread" or even the sales ban on conventional light bulbs in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine will often decide under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose Forderungen in Brussels generally by one or several Member States are represented (so tried Czech Republic at present, for example, to enforce the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Also, lobby interests stood behind that bananas of the highest grade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and may have no "curvature abnormality".
The European Commission defended this with the argument that she harmonize only the non-uniform national rules that would hamper trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been softened already by the EU against the resistance of some countries stating that the previous policy would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons on sale with the note, that children may inflate the balloon without adult supervision under eight years of age.
The EU invoked an American study, which are the leading cause of the death by suffocation of children in accordance with balloons.
A similar restriction applies already for children till 14 years old when using fair trumpet.
There are curious ideas at home
Also a policy that pertains to the European officials themselves is relatively absurd - everyone who has a formal role in the EU, may use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated fair in addition to the above absurdities in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists laissez also the EU regulation on the scope of laying on the territory of a Member State.
Thus, the EU put the maximum volume of laying fixed, which was allowed to be on the day of our accession to the EU on the territory of the Czech Republic.
Czech Republic exceeded then E.g. the set volume for mushroom preserves, what a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressed by the idea that certain countries should get money for this, that they have no sea, or by the idea to give funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were admittedly not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are thus at a disadvantage, having no sea.
We will request a refund to the EU", the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav said Palas (ČSSD) in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he stated that the harvest was very high and the State bearing as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU according to Palas should pay hundreds of millions of euro to us.
The European Commission met Czech Republic finally so far that she organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
For requests for funding, the regional development Ministry chaired by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered funding communities, specifically there should be funds for the preparation of grant money applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are the EU efforts to regulate in the Member States, to a target of criticism, and thus to effectiveness and development of throughout the European Union deserves recognition according to some experts, but rather.
According to these experts, the EU funding for projects that together have nothing with the deepening of European integration, which however were enforced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations in are more likely a more serious problem.
Emotions causes in this country the fact that Czech Republic like other Member countries in Brussels the right to use specific names of traditional products must fight and while not always wins this fight.
Czech Republic could although after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria the designation "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to rename our manufacturers but "Tuzemák".
The designation rum may be used only for products from sugar cane distillate products from sugar beet.
Rusk, carp from Pohořelice, and Třeboň, or also the Saaz hops appear in society of the world famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or of Parma ham of now of Carlsbad in the official list of products registered in the EU.
With a EU trade mark, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořice rolls can boast as.
"People want that I'll save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for President?
I'm not about to be Senator or President.
If everything would work in our country, I would not run.
But I can not longer see how the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free while the taxes and the retirement age increase the people.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
When I see something but, what you don't like me, then I try a solution to propose to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and to do so independently and no party affiliation, I have no other way to influence things, as for the Office of a Senator or the President run again.
In the Senate, you have succeeded and made then same on the way to the Castle.
Turn not your constituents back to this?
I've told all the time that I will take the fight to the Castle after the results of the senatorial elections.
Later I clarified this, and said that I would run for the Presidency if I am elected to the Senate.
But, my goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence and a possible strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people in the pub and in front of the TV rant, but cut down anyone who wants to make a difference.
To get the media who want to Rob one of the honor and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
About me was that I would bribe journalists or that I was Adviser to Jiří Paroubek said, for example.
Let's talk about your vision.
You took the fight to the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians as well as retroactive declarations about 20 million crowns.
To do this, you must change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
I've campaigned as a simple citizen me that the Guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small mind policy - when someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and only keeps on the population.
I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in the Parliament as an independent politician.
My advantage is that I can take the me without drawer thinking and party dogmas by any party, what is best for our country.
Look left or right as a human being in politics rather?
From the Czech perspective seems to me that people see me left.
For me, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right wing; I would like to connect people.
Always I endorse publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and also I will turn myself against bad ideas.
It displeases you, if someone called you the populists.
But confirm that not by what you have just said?
If you are a business plan in a company, then you have also an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
This may be because of me as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by key experts.
But only tags remain without support in the Parliament.
And thus to get in the long run not far in politics.
Or do you think that, if you're talking just long enough with the people, will succeed you, to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and to try on our side to bring them to enforce these goals.
As President, there would be no problem, the Chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to urge, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors by law for me.
And the addressed should then say why they reject this.
A strong personality that draws attention to abuses, to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, which was one of the merits of public pressure only once.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun to and trying to find the support of the majority of my program.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work out, then I go back again in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I'm no Savior.
I know that I alone do nothing; Therefore, I have spoken with several celebrities about whether she would run for the Senate.
For example, I have talked Radim Jančura, but declined due to overwork.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which revealed the fraud in trade with light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now, I'm no longer sure.
Sixty-five percent of the electorate have gone at all not on the elections, and those who have gone, have chosen mostly representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
The people have chosen such a composition of Senate changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions for the direct election of mayors and district captains.
Thinking about the establishment of a private party?
I have not thought about yet because I have no time to check the past of each potential used, and did not have the money for it.
I didn't even have money for the presidential campaign; There are only 20,000 CZK on my transparent account.
Do you have any money?
You are your talking about declarations, as would be like?
I guess my personal fortune to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and one Škodu superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream by the way - I liked James Bond ever, as he rode in the car, was galant to women and fought simultaneously against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, has a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but you want to invest your own money not to.
This is not exactly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program captures well not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are covered basically taken by my salary as a Senator.
But the Senator salary alone, I could not live; so I could finance my son for example not the English school, the 30,000 per month cost.
If I wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
Remain so more active as an entrepreneur, to be coming out?
Not did you say that you will drive back these activities?
But that is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially retracted my activities.
So, as my Deputy is Managing Director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live but also by something.
On which monthly income were you accustomed to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still so.
I would however set my activities as President.
See the full interview in the Saturday edition of the Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that are the true adventure not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchberg - 2 photos
"Funny, I find the building, it looks futuristic, and finally there to see again something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big, says: "However, it is beautiful the House already."
But I was wondering what we need today a library.
All of them have Internet, iPad, E-books.
Is no man today still volunteered in one of these old-style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a little visit needy bedroom community on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The community of 80,000 residents is the lowest formation rate of the entire Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, it was decided some time ago to contribute to the education and to develop the seven fictional bridges which are shown on the euro notes, as pretty bepinselte steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the education campaign has been limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there would be only a single way to tackle the statistics: A library must create!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master of the magnificent bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took the thing with his usual aplomb and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under her arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury still puzzled looked around and jerked with the armpits, stacked the cheeky Meuse his exquisite gift size to a pyramid and finished his ist based speech with the words: "Love town!"
Thats it so my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bökenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is filled up.
He is part of a revitalization project, include also underground car park, supermarket, post and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November the Buchberg was awarded with the second prize of "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 has been nominated.
So is the faceless small-town retort, which had to offer up to date no longer than for a piece of contemporary architecture richer a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly Town Hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public involved in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: book paradise under a cheese cover.
Although there is a lift which runs through the middle of the mountain, but the real space and reading revolution opens at foot-barreled climb the topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clearly, speak the language of a public square of burnt brick floor and the elegant street lights unequivocally.
The urban ambience is perfect.
It is looking for already park bench, dog and football of playing boys and girls.
And anywhere books, books, books.
"The bookshelves along the façade are typically available, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have the classic space configuration on the head and put the reading pane from inside to outside.
The Interior of the book Mountain is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, Internet-based library, Chess Club, environmental centre and Home Automation Control Panel.
The black bookcases are a special joy, the time wall tiling, times times staircase railings are sill,.
Look, feel, and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads whether the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we have encountered a suitable waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm someday.
For many years using a millimeter-thin plastic mat in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields as a root base.
This is low-cost and time-efficient.
The thin fabric holds one or two seasons, then it is ready for the bulky waste.
The fleece - pressed for the first time to four inches thick plates in these quantities - for the library.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, strain-enabled material turns, a fun new cars and a riding shoe smell.
After 105 steps, one has arrived at the Summit.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering, you are rewarded in the literary Café not only with fantastic views over the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen.
You create atmosphere, but especially for the correct humidity in the literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it Yes, but this House is a flagship project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Is the heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book Mountain stands under a glass globe, the sun shines only briefly in the Interior even on sunny days.
The wide glued binders, which are transverse to the glass facade, serve as shade and intercept much of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared their way into the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Bökenberg even called Spijkenisses 'long overdue soul'.
The reason: opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
Thus, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 units - are to be filled for the time being once.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled capacity.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, now every inhabitant has a certain relationship to this new House.
Everyone knows that his book part of this building is.
And if it is only for decoration.
Thus, those Supreme discipline succeeded MVRDV, which is called in the jargon of identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
It may be so young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.
Szabó: "Germans must play greater role"
Germany has abstain in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, of Berlin thus balances on a fine diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: earlier this week Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then, Berlin is included.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis in Gaza have done.
Now, Germany must be careful on the basis of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also supports not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany abstained also the voice, when it came, to set up a no-fly zone.
It was finally enforced by NATO.
It difficult Germany to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is just his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed so to speak by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
So the Germans can be found between the fronts against.
Is expected of them, that they play a more independent role, because they are but not used.
I think they grope is still on their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions that are independent of those of the United States or European partners with national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, about Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other great powers to a certain degree, and that is why Germany has to protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful to meet the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to the head.
That plays a role in any case.
But I would want to not attach also the too much weight, which is not completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations in any case.
Germany damaged its relations with the United States, it has included important decisions of the voice such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German position.
Therefore, I don't think that this was a breach of so dramatic as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will play a is even a certain respect.
Because it signals yet that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have expressed their clear, however, for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European Nations?
These differences have always existed due to American domestic politics.
I believe that Obama's Government has secretly probably quite sympathetic to the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the Government may not represent public course this position.
I believe that the actual differences are not so big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so absolutely thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
Hard it Germany to agree on its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and consistent European policy, which currently is not the case.
So, they cannot be part of a wider line and instead must advance things from their own position.
You do this just with the euro.
I think in the future, Germany will assume a leading role, to urge Europe to a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a touchy subject.
But I think that the Germans is clear, that they must play a more independent role.
Sees itself as a major international player himself in the role Germany - Germany ever wants to assume a leading role?
Or the leadership is still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not accustomed, that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is difficult still the country, to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, because various anti-German feelings be free each time, when Germany assumes a greater role.
This makes it not just the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Now continuously decreases the influence of the United States in European politics, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans are simply must play a greater role.
Even if you don't like them, it is unpleasant to them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China, which however has nothing to do with the original company behind.
However, they enjoy protection as long as the actual namesake is not complaining.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It will be increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, specialised on copyright infringement in the far East is Thomas Vinod hole.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters range the imitators, so that you may login to their brands.
So Lu-Gucci, rather than Prada is easy from Gucci man can wear Prada Kane.
Also German companies doing this legally copied, as the sporting goods manufacturer PUMA.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the Office in Beijing.
A Chinese company had there the trademark Zegna DF PUMA protect, an art name that is served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna at September 14, 2010.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in the copy and the injured of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively to counterfeiting.
Patt hole cases but are different: on behalf of his clients take action, that Chinese companies officially received the right from the Trademark Office to use a label that is already elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a brand of the passenger.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant, fish are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"This is bad for business, you must fight it", calls standoff hole.
"The brand will be diluted, the all setting disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned going into the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the world's fastest growing in the year amounting to EUR 15 billion.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the register of trade marks are difficult to achieve, and go in the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can take, with an uncertain outcome.
Standoff holes reported cases in which the Court dismissed lawsuits, because after a long period the offending name has become the "market reality".
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he must pay even money the plagiarist because he violated its trademark in China, says Patt hole.
Sometimes, the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases relate to graphical elements.
2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with a construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company, which recently took over the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese must use until today an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo, commemorating the BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion company in China was defeated by generic from Hong Kong and Singapore, who look at the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Btmo Crimson in Beijing although admits that there 2010 there were bottlenecks due to lower personnel and equipment.
Last year, it was but the "Emergency in the work flow returned to normal".
So, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings 22 per cent was dropped.
Almost 57,000 of such cases you have completed 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, wait in the Office still 81.500 appeals on registration.
To address costs much
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year more than 1.4 million applications received the Crimson on trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
That was a record and meant that China leads in a row to the list of new applications in all over the world for the tenth time, the authority shall.
That applies also to the inventory of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees had been captured.
This means simplified that any registration in the section cost 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
To address costs many times as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the Group fights against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans could reach that its illegal production of fake automotive parts has been excavated.
But the generic still secured the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg.
You missed that, because in Germany surnames could not be protected Hanno Wentzler, Chairman &amp; CEO of Freudenberg chemical Specialities in Munich says.
The Crimson Office also rejected the opposition of Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got that right, but the defendant continues to fight until today.
You have to watch like hell
It is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the procedure is extremely expensive and cost us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly put a figure, the company archive have have to see through even a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg of the opposite side offered a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle in vain.
"Because you can see how much this is worth", says Wentzler.
Back to splash the dangers in the far East are threatening even to Europe.
Namely, if there, imitators unprotected brands secure.
So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to login name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business field, yet he could avert the registration.
"You have to watch like hell", says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer standoff hole advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners should "everything that is somehow worthy of protection, apply also in China" as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registry.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject in the last act of the drama of his brand, then you would probably pay royalties for the own name the opposite side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed into the relevant segment of the market.
World AIDS Day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi - choir rehearses and AIDS orphans in Swaziland is getting happy.
The story of a connection that transcends more than 8733 kilometers.
First is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and Mr slipper look for the clock on the parquet floor, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Only then, the voices of the singers swell slowly - Alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and traced.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, lifts it almost out of his cloth shoes if he merges it with his smooth wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg is the Imbongi choir rehearsing a new song.
50 Singers and singers are come, aged between 23 and 69, from the geneticist and the Hausmann.
' OM'Obani "is no easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and it even in a very foreign language: Zulu, that eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and is spoken in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are approximately 34 million infected with HIV, UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the treatment of AIDS, your estimates.
23.5 Million people living in southern of Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now living with HIV.
The Association voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
You can take on a sponsorship for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily in the GoGo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storytellers or even Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluency can nobody in this room but sing.
The choir practice songs in this foreign soft language for almost ten years and she returns, and even then, where they originally come from: in the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 km as the crow flies from Heidelberg Centre in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because they have succumbed to HIV.
Evident in Esitjeni in small, how very Swaziland suffers from: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Clipping the male foreskin, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people of Swaziland have the immunodeficiency virus, not uncommon with mid thirties to die.
In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only on parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without education, you have certainly no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a child to the school to send still private commitment of individuals, for a couple of bucks a year and to allow him a hot meal of the day.
But a year later the choir founded the Association "Voices for Africa", which is since almost professionally caring for orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common Viral STI are HIV, human Pappilomaviren Herpes herpes or hepatitis.
The parasitic STI include Pubic Lice and scabies.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute expects that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human Pappilomaviren are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country relatively small - yet: 20 percent of the new HIV infections accounted for by this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections occur much more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country, also human Pappilomaviren in adolescents occur frequently.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis cases has more than doubled according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in the year 2001 on 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is decreasing since 2007.
2011 there have been cases around 2700.
This is approximately one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, vaginal discharge, pelvic pain and blisters or warts.
Often, they can however cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but not offer full protection.
Because some pathogens can be passed sexually transmitted diseases lubrication infections with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts especially for frequently changing sexual partners recommend regular testing.
Early diagnosed can be cured most STI and prevent complications.
Through sponsorships, donations, and last but not least the fees which the choir in whole Germany he sings himself, a lot comes together.
"Overall we have sent around 200 000 euro Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself managed a confident and assertive woman, Zodwa Dlamini, the money from Germany.
You also care that the orphans is well accommodate at one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, as it is called the old women to Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans to, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day appear just in time for school.
Who is no more, is a single woman who is paid by the Association as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children in the shelter Khanyisile.
Also, "Voices for Africa" has let a sewing school in life called, make two chicken houses built and organized jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI, that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because the disease across the country also is so obvious, one silent dead prefer them.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country in which the King is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is due that the HIV virus has so quickly spread in the past few decades this state-sanctioned way of life.
But also the many migrant, which carry the virus across the country.
There free condoms while at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, travels every two, three years jointly by the South of Africa's Imbongi choir and singing songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence, and black self-esteem, who know many of the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white, singing songs in a black - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has defied that even some fierce border guards a few tears.
The journey takes whatever to Esitjeni, where the singer can visit their godchildren.
Even though one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the Valley of the Ezulweni River, it is more than known.
"After Esitjeni, because the light is" the people there say.
And if the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies return to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then one sees shine there too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice should be may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there are also there frozen water as three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is a sheet of ice in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water came probably comets or possibly asteroids that are bashed on mercury.
Nobody put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the Chief Scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how got water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the corresponding probes, telescopes, and small robots such as Phoenix are to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: small peepholes into infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera that have developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is according to the new definition of the terms of the International Astronomical Union from 2006 no "planet".
This image of an infrared recording the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of Star: the oldest stars are as blue points to recognize are the pink "newborn" in the star circle Hall harder to identify.
This star-forming region - by scientists unromantic W5 called - the telescope has discovered Spitzer in the star image of Cassiopeia 6500 light-years away.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has recorded the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star in the dying process hurled out.
Located in the enormous Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new star arise from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the Galactic birth room.
Called the Pleiades star cluster, "The seven sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, the colors come however better to the best advantage.
Such as a red, the Helix Nebula in this infrared photograph looks ahead to the Viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought the title of North America in this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular colours.
This baby star could only be resumed by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors in its full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: How these have arisen, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and hottest shots of the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour images of spiral galaxies are true works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years distant in the constellation Sagittarius Trifid Nebula.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts, three Spalten), as dark dust strips instance the glowing heart of the birthplace of stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic Carom: 400 million light-years away rush the nuclei of two merging galaxies together to and are inevitably are colliding.
The birth of these stars was the Hubble space telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who are not technical abbreviations, which may call them at her nickname southern wheel of fire.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the IRIS Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away.
This group of galaxies, ARP 273 called the space telescope Hubble for NASA is recorded.
Scientists UGC 1810 call the larger spiral galaxy.
In this Nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.
The stern cradle produces new youngster.
Also these stars cloud brings forth new baby star combined with the Rosette Nebula, - 5000 light-years away.
Still no dust, but rather only gas exists in this bright shining Galaxy with a small black hole.
Researchers suspect that he was born shortly after the big bang, was mainly hydrogen to be found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The main telescopes
The telescope should be - invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey even before Galileo Galilei one year later used it to star gazing.
Since then the mirrors of optical telescopes have been getting bigger - and the insights which they deliver deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world was.
The mirror in the picture, had an average of five meters.
There is the large binocular telescope in Arizona, United States.
It looks into space equal to two mirror admits, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge – alone of the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African large telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reached a diameter of 11 meters.
Disadvantage of reasonable construction: the telescope is lashed in his elevation - and limited in his mobility.
Also the hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in elevation.
Its special feature: the high light gathering power.
This is namely - despite relatively small mirror diameter — to the world's largest telescopes.
Researchers monitor space for alien signals using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Every computer owner can help with the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI), providing computing power available.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It says here that the very large telescope - which lives up to its name.
The telescope can illuminate the middle infrared spectrum with its four mirrors.
The European extremely large telescope is scheduled also on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror to include whopping 42 metres - and used from approximately 1000 mirror elements together.
With images, but no earlier than 2018 is expected.
Until 2007 the two Keck Telescopes on a Hawaiian Volcano Mauna Kea is considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two levels with each an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which can look next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.
The Hubble Space Telescope provides the main impressions from the space however.
Since April 24, 1990, it provides images of distant worlds already.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 was announced by NASA, 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the final preparations to the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The space infrared telescope primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: to light from the first stars and galaxies after the big bang look.
Scientists assume that ice exists at the South Pole of mercury.
However there is no reliable data, because the Messenger at the North Pole far closer orbit around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on mercury for decades.
Through the 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Daily drink butter - and be 168 years old
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical old age.
There is even a Museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country, in which 97-Jährige are still comparatively young.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical old age.
There is even a Museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country, in which 97-Jährige are still comparatively young.
The trip by the Talysh mountains is romantic to name a few.
The van rumbles on the winding road, past thickly wooded hills, raging rivers and simple houses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think that it would be in the black forest.
But this is the deepest South of Azerbaijan, the border with the Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known except that she speaks perfect Persian as well as Aserisch and is very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town is set to solid crisis architecture from Soviet times who wants to so do not even fit in the scenic mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come here barely, the directions of Azerbaijan capital Baku is too burdensome.
For the 323 kilometers it eight hours is necessary because the road is only single lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not here yet arrived in the province.
But Pileta Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the makings of the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - next year, we have a Festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the Vita by eight dozen Talysh is documented from the area, which shows older than 100th on a black and white photo Fatulayeva.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years begotten a child
But the controversial star of the Museum is the Shepherd of Şirali Müslümov which should have become at the age of 168.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man who was 122 years old Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he should have begotten a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov miscalculated so his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, has heard of the "very old" in Central Asia.
"There are remarkably many elderly people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "live in Sardinia extremely many very old men".
Due to missing documents, but no scientific proof of the age was to lead, because registers were missing.
Every day way cup melted butter
But the fact is that the people in the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 persons who are older than 100 years.
So why live here in the South so many elderly?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh said with the special genes of the Talysh.
Director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it was the diet.
But that precisely the rich diet of the Talysh to be as healthy, who love bread, meat and especially dairy products and of which drink many a glass of daily melted butter, seems hardly plausible from a safety perspective.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Jack Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she relentlessly back and forth rolls.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents long ago.
Two toddlers jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped glasses of Armadu guests.
Mirzayevas are perfectly white teeth in row and limb under her headscarf conceals them long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled before us.
I washed my hair with milk, so they never went out me and kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
She has eaten only that what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I've bought not a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the second world war.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, driven to the father figure of the nation who ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no bounds in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan old.
An amount by which one can live well receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local conditions.
And maybe even Mirzayevas long graying son is right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "Human" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep split in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian President is not saved with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he can succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, above all but probably the Christian Copts, the Liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because they all have hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically, that temporarily curtailed powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its agenda "in order to save the revolution".
But what the 61 year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save it, the Egyptians, are is the world not completely in the clear.
Should the judiciary be overthrown?
Actually, the 234 articles are worrying that the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly, because in a nightly, 15 hour ride were rushed through some concern.
As in previous constitutions even stated in the draft, why the case law on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does it mean "Principles"?
This was and is the interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least a newly added guided article suggests that: in all matters concerning the Sharia Al Azhar University must be manual, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great charisma in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not be, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise legislation what would de facto have the disenfranchisement of the judiciary resulted.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be further maintained.
These dishes were used during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Arrestbetweenapril.
The State should also, as it stands in the draft "the true essence of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values".
This is formulated legal point of view, so blurred that State institutions with the help of this article could control even the contents of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
There is no article by the way expressly establishes equality between men and women.
For another prohibits insulting the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers or slander.
But what is an insult and how she should be punished, remains unclear.
Also dubious is the formulation, "Insulting people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a leader?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, which exists in Morsi for signature and according to him "very soon" will be presented the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has come back"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening on Tahrir square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Leanne Sabbahi, 3rd place finisher of the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft Constitution belong "on the rubbish of history".
Via short message service Twitter he accused morsi's followers to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will to his palace go and overthrow him", said the opposition Jasser said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned", the Egyptian media have quoted the opposition leader Chaled Ali.
And several justices announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which it would be invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to the counter-demonstration, just in case but not on Tahrir square, but after a mass prayer on the opposite bank of the Nile at the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists participated in and shouted: "The people demands the application of God's law."
They demanded by Mursi: "Clean the country!" and promised: "The Quran is our Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the emblematic Tahrir square, where everything began, would have conjured up probably civil war conditions.
Morsi's followers wanted to do not risk quite obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood said proponents as well as opponents of the draft had expressed loud and clear.
Now is the time to decide the people at the ballot box in what direction the country should go.
A majority shall be considered safe for the design of the Islamists.
"The word not even comes before human rights"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which actually would have until February to go and involve all social forces.
The 48 year old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood as they sat under Mubarak in prison or were before the Court.
Not because he'd share their worldview, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For he was beaten up, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complained in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi power Ausweitung were on all three branches in the State to be resigned to the lawyer.
These actions are flagrant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put them de facto override", Saeda complained.
However, a democracy could not function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considered the ideological direction of struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "you gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave it there a week.
Something must the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and these stubborn odor in the air that just won't go away.
Rakfisk is sprinkled trout that-, how smelly they would like to have his fish - up to a year in water is fermented depending on salt.
If in Norway comes the darkness over the land and the weather gets colder, stream Norwegians into a celebration here in Fagernes, this, now, really captivating specialty dedicated to is.
"You eat it raw and then rinsing it with a glass of aquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as so-called "Rakfisk-General" organizes the Festival.
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and to consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Number of people more than the Rakfisk like the aquavit", Harvard says.
The spirit can displace the odor.
I taste some snacks.
When to avoid bringing the Rakfisk close to the nose, he is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite a long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling options and dipped in the autumn in airtight barrels of salt water fish.
In the depths of winter he was then taken out after long fermentation and eaten - no doubt see senses muffled by alcohol.
A generation ago, faced thousands of Norwegians in search of work forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants lured by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Immigrants flock from Sweden, the old rivals, which was far richer than Norway, not too long ago.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, smelling part of Norwegian history if also strict.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here everything is expensive--a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euro.
Norway not often succeed in the world press, and which seems not to bother most people.
Here, one there still hates Anders Breivik on behalf to name a few - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians do find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country such brutal killings is capable.
The growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries of the world is mainly responsible for the present wealth of Norway's since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it goes so well us," says Anna, our waitress who distributed round trays with ripe Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are one - how do you - say prudent people.
Her English is just like that of most people here flawless.
We are not very pretentious, we like not an idle boast.
Norway is handled very carefully with its oil wealth--a large portion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the great depression all money around threw, that they had not, Norway was firmly closed his wallet.
"As long as we can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk", she adds with light-hearted laughter.
I stand in the snow and make me for another court - by Rakfisk, I've had enough.
As a Moose-Burger is something else anyway. The juicy meat tastes me.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel where I logon, is one of several venues, organizing a Rakfisk dinner the guests for the best--or perhaps the most challenging the Geruchssinne--fish can agree.
There is a live TV link to a presenter with a bow tie-clad surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard".
It claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But perhaps it is but the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
As Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, analyses Will Grant by the BBC of the upcoming it challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is an always clogged city, but on Monday, a steel ring was built, which shuts off several important traffic routes in the capital and ensuring chaos on the streets.
The goal was not it however, to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from, to reach the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's armband and assumed the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing Government of Felipe Calderón Mexico has to prove themselves well economically but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost already 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My Government committed heavily to reduce violence", Pena Nieto told the U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US President on par, Pena Nieto worked as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this sprawling, densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, divided the opinions about the new head of State.
A direct man
One is reminded in the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, likes him.
Inhabitants of the resort of attributing him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, can you go on one of the highways, built the Pena Nieto and represent a vast improvement over the crumbling, bumpy streets, which once existed.
Plaques bearing his name hanging outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting changes", as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a U.S. Congressman from the party of Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, we hope with regard to the security and economy, on an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party is great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years out of the President Palace of Los Pinos.
The allegations of the opposition, the new President it lacks substance, he refuses.
He was very involved with a very straightforward man and have big plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, especially he is also someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the State, not many people share this view about their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle could be del Bravo not greater.
The place is tucked away under Highway overpasses and represents, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, turned the military to fight drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill site the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left behind in the last two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women have been murdered in the State of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
Pena Nietos critics believe that he is at least not adequately addressed the issue of the murder of women during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his Government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down district, Irinea Buendia struggling with tears, as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed, as her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the caused had begun.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down from the wall on us. It is located next to a cross, which bears a single word: justice.
But you have denied her exactly this, so the family, until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
You want that you simply accepted her judgment and keeps the mouth.
"But this is not possible, if there were so many irregularities and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's armband on Saturday, he takes over therefore also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were pulled over the past six years of violence suffered, and the new President has promised to worry about during his tenure to this problem.
The PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo says "I hope as President he is, how he became Governor,".
But just before the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The Prosecutor's Office claims: Bradley Manning had not complained of ill-treatment
The public prosecutor's Office contradict Bradley Mannings allegations, he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing focuses on Mannings time in the military prison at Quantico, VA.
The Defense seeking a dismissal of the indictment due to tough prison conditions
The U.S. Army Corporal is accused to have stolen thousands of confidential documents
The public prosecutor's Office on Friday tried to determine that the army Gefreite Bradley Manning - missed indicted for the biggest revelation of confidential information of in U.S. history--several opportunities, over the mistreatment allegedly suffered by him in who to complain.
Maj explained in a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland. Ashden fine, that documents relating to weekly visits, that prison officials had made while Mannings nine prison in Quantico, VA., had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which held the defense to the dismissal of the indictment as a result of an application – whether Manning by hard prison time already adequately punished, Manning had testified he had considered suicide in the prison.
Accused the intelligence analyst of the US Army, who was arrested in June 2010 to have stolen thousands of sensitive documents while serving in the Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday the forms went through fine with Manning, who had filled out officials after their meeting with manning during his detention at the military prison in Quantico, where he served from July 2010 to April 2011 under reinforced conditions of detention.
The officials asked manning questions and wrote his answers.
As fine him on Friday about the forms respondents, manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had asked manning directly about his treatment.
Manning said he have verbally expressed his concerns to and officials had discussed this with him and given to deal with this. You have been not logged however.
"You wrote"No problems"(after meeting the concerns), and that does not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all", so Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked manning why he not complained about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a Committee, some months previously should examine it on a form of mentioned suicidal thoughts.
Manning answered during this meeting have consisted his intention to downgrade its observership "Prevention of injury".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - a level of the suicide risk - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees of which that it went well me, and rid the observation status to the prevention of violations of (...) to achieve a better quality of life from my point of view", Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait where he nearly two months was held, before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the marine base Quantico in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he had considered suicide and had become once unconscious due to the heat, he said.
Not to know what happens with him or in the outside world, has been stressful.
"My world contracted, camp Arafjon on this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often longer than 23 hours - and without society.
You have it only allows a mattress, a blanket, Flip-Flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it had been forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
Always he did have to sleep with light that penetrated from outside his cell.
If he himself had flipped at night and guards could not see his face, you have woken him up so that it turns back again.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally raised objection to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was moved at the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning asked also to an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he must sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and against guards and other prisoners stand naked at a morning count.
Manning had testified he never had the opportunity during this census, to surround himself with his blanket.
The survey on Friday manning stated that he made from his guard command that he should drop the ceiling, with which he can cover. He admitted, however, that nobody had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced into the previous night to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show that he poses no danger to themselves a civil servant.
Manning had the officials said he would use the waistband of his underwear or his Flip-Flops to hurt themselves, but not done so.
That night, so Manning said his underwear, flip flops, and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that his prison experiences to at least respect the judge and his detention measure would drastically reduce, should he be convicted at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The Defense has stated that manning lesser misdemeanor guilty is committed, while other charges, which are regarded as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. A justification of detention conditions is expected by the public prosecutor's Office.
The Pentagon remains at his position, that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions which apply to all prisoners held under the highest security in Quantico, Virginia.
The favoring of the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence information in the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents are among the charges against Manning.
Is he found guilty to all counts, threatens him a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of missing opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans between two worlds are trapped
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had only just crossed the Hall and had arrived at the passport control when helplessness in me was wide.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds long, uncertain of which I myself should go.
I grew up in Central California and "Mexicans" was called all my life.
Exactly how, my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians" call an ethnic symbol.
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just plain Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to hold me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going off also my American accent.
So, I took my American passport and introduced me to the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
All those issues are expected to meet the heads of these two countries were on the agenda: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain nowadays as likely in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, although he named no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico, and this forced the leadership of the country holding out gun to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
If so, a US Government official has even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one - stops in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how Americans urge the sovereignty of its neighbour.
And the children of Montezuma embark on the warpath.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico's truth in the relationship lies with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans, who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for the opportunities the country, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio living, is that at one point in our family tree, one person, maybe offered got a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the North.
And in most cases this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visited good schools and good jobs will have we must never lose sight, that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurry sometimes perhaps, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a Memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never well be enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families not in Mexico would have failed, they would not have.
And then we would not see us now caught behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child, immigrated legally to the United States, reminded me that Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions between, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican-Americans resent this them.
While it is a United States citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated want to resume ties with the diaspora.
You want to use Mexican Americans provisional 'Ambassador' for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great is a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders, to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country in the face of the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption, and the drug-related violence.
I'm afraid, because you need to through alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries ago they must also accept that some Mexican Americans cherish a grudge that their family members were treated until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The truce between Israel and Hamas could prove to be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there be ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in the bud.
Countless buildings reduced to rubble were laid in the midst of the usual finger-pointing, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza close to the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem are bashed.
But although Israelis and Palestinians appear trapped in their historic conflict, he changed Middle East around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Maybe this will lead only to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff might finally find its end.
A war, which is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the this week's fighting have strengthened the hard-nosed on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his grouping had to record large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and crammed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the resounds and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, has not succeeded Israel so far, to destroy Hamas.
Actually gains the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So, as Islamists have increased their influence in the Arab world, Hamas has can draw rich and powerful friends on your site.
Turkey, a back-country, regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken party one of the richest and most dynamic Golf States for Hamas - just like Qatar.
Cheering Hamas supporters to believe that to Israel an Islamic Crescent forms - from the Lebanon in the North, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels of increasingly islamistischeren embossed Bashar Assad's could stand before the support to back to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the King.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - changed the balance of the region the by far the highest population and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel's persistent.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot 2011 30 years ruled Egypt until his overthrow, had left little time for Hamas.
In contrast to this, the brotherhood with the Hamas is related by marriage and their leaders more of people views depend on.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could be as an actor, which not can excluded itself from Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, can draw an opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no threat militarily seen.
The Israeli missile defense system, "iron dome", has to prove himself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least awhile long Israel can sleep quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States adhere steadfastly to their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest Gewalteskalationen.
Fared well Israel in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, for example, is the country not least remained relatively free of suicide bombers – thanks to its locking facilities, the inside run in the West Bank and thus the bulk of an eventual Palestinian State. These protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for illegal under international law, but always further expanded.
Netanyahu stands out as well. His Likud party has allied himself in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren group.
Left to their own state why coddle also these malevolent Palestinians and them?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they fire rockets also not exactly like their comrades in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall at Bay and punish them should they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard-liners can prevail. But the Arab spring could make them a stroke through the Bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and in other countries in power, have left little for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab Governments barely repair their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi with Barack Obama teamed to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps to symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democracy, Palestinians are deprived continue their autonomy - a powder keg that undoubtedly to explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just like this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression undermines democracy in the Jewish State already, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to the repression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take their diplomatic toll increasing over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that which is represented by the wiser representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two States cede the areas where Israel for security purposes.
-Small for the near future – hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt must stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip have in common with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish State based on borders of 1967, complemented by land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem, to persuade.
Outside Arab Nations should move also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
Thus, more for the creation of a Palestinian State would be done as with the upcoming request to UN observer status.
Obama also must help his part to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he dismissed the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems far away in the White House, he would be averse to participation as well.
But that is an unfortunate and short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws are in force in Australia. So brand logos and colours be replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are printed in addition to dramatic images showing diseased body parts and babies affected by cigarette smoke and children.
Aside from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs in the brand name, which are printed in identical, small font is coming Saturday.
Thus, Australia leads the world's strictest rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco use will be eliminated.
In this respect the Government assumes studies, which showed that people who still do not have started to smoke with 26, also no longer will start with 99% probability.
"You can see with children of young age, that they understand the message, try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image", so Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cited studies that have shown that children associate the Crown of of logo with the idea of a Princess, for example.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and only slightly changes will affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said with the laws the black-market trade would favors, what would lead to cheaper and easier-to-reach cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra HA by Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand greatly increased after cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging, since corporations British American tobacco, Britain's Imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco have failed two months ago Australian Supreme Court with its challenge of the laws.
Zico had sold to wholesale stores up to 6,000 units and wait for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media is exactly the population to whom the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbids them to act as sports sponsors, and forced most traders no longer put out cigarettes in stores. Now, the tobacco advertising on the Internet has changed.
The Australian Government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sites, has not have any influence on international sites.
"Who marketed tobacco and has only a small area, to promote its products, does not get around the Internet", says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted a surge in reports to brand authored by "ordinary people".
We must ask ourselves the question: that's just a private citizen, which takes so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes to take on even a video for it - or a marketing agency that has to do?
British American tobacco Australia says, that is the industry instead of marketing to focus, to deal with the new legislation.
She has gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules – those countries complain at the World Trade Organization over unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries has greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek according the Government has held talks with other countries who are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile, these were expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and the Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"It simply takes a butt and puts away the box," Victor El says Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes, on which a photo with a mouth tumour is printed.
Honestly speaking there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade in "King of the Pack" in the Centre of Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made filling his shelves.
"Previously I needed an hour to sort a delivery now I need four," Yu says.
"The Government would have to completely ban cigarettes - then we had okay said that's it, sealing," he adds visibly angrily.
In a continuously electrified world, it's nice to be sometimes bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as was our aircraft due to mechanical problems and we had to wait on a different plane.
So, I had enough time to make me a few thoughts to boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport one to wait for flight is pretty annoying - even, if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's for us and our children - okay, being occasionally bored.
Thus the brain is forced to lose, interesting thoughts which might enhance the creativity.
And because most of us these days almost always stare at the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom won't benefit us.
Should we therefore welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
Sure I come back again.
How many people even I am always assumed, that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "boredom: A lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) which does not appear.
"Actually the boredom has a very long history," he says.
A Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century decorates the walls of Pompeii.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada according to is the problem is that boredom in many ways has been defined and discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience can be define "to engage in any satisfying activity, but not to this".
Boredom differs from apathy as a result so that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of attention, coupled with bad mood and feel that time passes slowly".
Boredom can be heard almost as it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two States in context may be, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that is boring us, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" – to German as: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention", in September in the journal "Perspectives on psychological science" was published, wise Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment and the operator a tape listened to where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room, that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group at all not heard these noises.
Those who heard the barely audible television, say they feel more boredom than the two other groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for this and wrote to their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If however, a monotonous activity carried out - "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to feel not bored".
In fact, he says we now know that foraging dithers and doodling, often as a sign of boredom interpreted, even can combat this by people remain physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are jumping around, learn more and retain more information than those forced to sit still are," as Professor Fenske.
All of us will ever get bored - my delayed flight, a booming speakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to the vulnerability of boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements offers such as "Many things that I have to do repeat themselves and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I have not enough time for everything".
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida-, particularly the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But, in General, teenagers are a pretty tight bunch.
Reed Larson, Professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, introduced in 1991 by experiment, where he seven to eight times contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents on the day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and while doing the homework were bored, while 23% indicated to be bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents stated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom are increased or decreased.
He was however sure that "the youth as a particularly boring perceived", mainly because children and teenagers have no influence on their daily flow.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes that people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs, to relieve it – studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers explore the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom the brain wants to tell, that you should do something else", as Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what to do just the best.
When is a boring and to use this energy to play guitar and to Cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide in the short term, while feelings of happiness, they evaporate in the long term but again.
Who extends his bored child so an iPad, can bring down certainly from the boredom. It has not learned that but to entertain themselves or control, Professor Fenske said.
And he adds: "Self-control spreads of a situation to the other".
The child learns not only to entertain, but receives more self-regulation in other areas.
I don't think that we should celebrate boredom.
We should not be too critical see it also.
Instead, our aim should consist, also away from the constant activity and technology drip irrigation to feel us.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so than needs to be more boring to us. But boredom is excruciating, unrelenting desire to do something useful,"he says.
He believes that people in fact are looking only for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we constantly over are stimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silenced once."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19 year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for a misdemeanor in court, which will be soon legal in this State: the possession of some less chunks of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day in Lamar car close to the border with Kansas on the road, when they were arrested.
After the police had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - offenses, each fitted with a penalty of $ 100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated as criminals", so Orozco.
But he is also one?
Depends on the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences, less by the law than by the location in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the State to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use.
Hundreds of offences that are turning to marijuana, are here and in the State of Washington approved the similar measures, already dropped.
Police no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts in Colorado have announced to continue existing marijuana offenses and quote are still people in court.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver, through to the Western mountains in vote to prevent new, state licensed marijuana shops opening in their communities.
"This situation evolves so quickly, that I don't know what will happen next", says Daniel j. Oates, Chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And even regulators in the State of Washington is clueless scratching their heads.
You are waiting for a guide to establishing a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period until December 1, 2013 in mind.
In Washington, if one believes that Colorado is the most States ahead in any case, what concerns the regulation of marijuana. There was legalized the drug only for medical purposes and then to the own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The State is therefore suitable for the orientation", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for liquor stores in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, we can follow," he added.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and is also the terminus of a grey area, in which the State licensing system but does not exist, but the ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be - clarified during this time such as the State standard of "reasonable access" to license marijuana with the prohibition shall be agreed cannabis shops within a radius of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere it will be more difficult, to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an E-Mail in which he said the Prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses for persons over the age of 21, his employees in Aurora and that the police "now" will seek no criminal charges for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police will enforce continue to city specifications to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continues to pursue.
In Weld County in Northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly, to move consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently 119 persons for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana Court must answer, although many also for other crimes were indicted.
"Our agency has the duty to prosecute violations, which were criminal offences at the time", Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer displays adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided but also to do so, not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
"I don't think that I waste my time to enforce the right, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear right from the outset that it would be not easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of Government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the State encouraged a profound dichotomy in regard to the large green days experiment among local officials.
When District Attorney was a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for marijuana-related crimes in court and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"You've spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute that they always still cannot accept the legalization for people", he believes.
As the first States that handle smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, dealt in Colorado and Washington as a national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and State officials prepare for an era of legal sales, waiting at the same time also nervous statements of the Federal Government, which will handle the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice is yielding.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama Government believes, that detective who will enter no doors probably to seize small amounts of drugs, are reluctant but most likely to tolerate the legal under the new law, Government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait that the Federal Act.
Before election day, some local Governments approved moratoria on new marijuana operations, although this could open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the West, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We would not be in a position, in which we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level", so Bob Nicholson, Member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We focus then, for what the community has decided and not afterwards, the State has opted for what.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for their views
Has always been greatest dream was my to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, I once considered to be the largest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek Symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilization--freedom of thought and tolerance--.
But two weeks after my entry into the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The evening standard stated that I would be gone, because I would have had a problem with it, that fellow students in the adjacent room had sex.
The author of A N Wilson mischievously said I could leave the University because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not due to my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
You had me just for a reason harassed - one reason seemed so parochial and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key Adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the conservative party.
Why I mention this right now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar prosecution.
Organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed now such dimensions that a bunch of them last week demanded the same equal protection benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Specify the conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they will be on the basis of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable".
Request a seat on the equal opportunities Committee of College, to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC two, "Wonderland: young, bright, and on the right", portraying the Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It was among other graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove a Rolls-Royce and showed off silver-coloured suit with silver-covered walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "Scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year old Luke black, Vice President of the conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, he said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend of link at universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without ever having met us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative Student Association of Oxford says she have observed a growing aversion to students of the moderate right in JCR members.
"This represents a danger for intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford I was such a minority.
As incredibly shy 18 year old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year, the University that had voted Margaret Thatcher - a previous student, to give no honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have put even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first week, where new students meet up and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but participated even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners strike, privatization, and the rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa's Government found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
My first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century in English. What then should come, I had been unmounted.
"Miss Wyatt", the tutor of Harry Pitt (now deceased), said "contact over the first paragraph".
I stumbled here.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from cake mix, and quite spiteful.
"Refuse Thatcher supporter, to learn French, or are they just stupid?", he asked.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears manage to.
"I suggest that they take some French lessons in your spare time - so, if you are not too busy with your social activities", Pitt growled at me.
Hanging his head, I returned to my room.
This evening, I sat in college alone at dinner, when somebody lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is harassed.
For me, it's bad enough, but they know that your father of Margaret Thatcher is close, so it will be worse for you.
The most Tory students pretending to be supporters of the labour party.
At a local pub, I tried later to dissemble.
I insisted that I was not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher of agrees.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who as a conservative force Eton College had visited, said that ironically to me: 'you're the daughter of a fascist pig'.
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" one asked me.
That fight each other, or?
I felt so as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States had to have felt.
Would succeed depending on me to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I can meet only like-minded people after dark?
Should I need to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years, which lay in front of me, expanded my mind's eye to a purgatory of exclusion and isolation.
The only tutor who did open as a Tory, was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, which had its seat in my college.
He was not only hated being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded, and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
in 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will be not happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents House and took refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me, that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They would never do such a thing not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends were always impeccable manners on the day.
Himself tarnished his moist eyes.
Give a chance to the whole.
I'm sure you only teases you.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance grew weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporter, had yielded to the pressure and renounce his beliefs.
While a tutorial in the following week, in which a further history tutor seriously maintained, I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging with shame, I admitted that I had submitted to my parents "Brainwashed", and named it "old sucker".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press per week.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and my captors gave up after five minutes.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should have to suffer ever school such intimidation and wickedness.
And even more tragic is that it was a University, Oxford – not produced only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hiding today behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino is elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture", which opened this week in London, says ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of the lodging of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has recognised the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture", a magnificent retrospective for the more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture created by its "Maison" in the last 50 years have been compiled.
"I love this Palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani is, but do not have can be written without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino felt has always been fascinating for the stuffy and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the world's finest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England until Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion designers in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love, in the nobility must not be detrimental.
"At least she not escape their tipping on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, lived both in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all are glad if we were invited to his house in Gstaad," the ex-wife of "Heini" explains Thyssen tight friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has chosen has always been the elegance of celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza do not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went di Spagna in Rome after a fashion show at the Piazza to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including even Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and it felt its influence.
"All invited feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", which in 1995 began her career at the Haute Couture week in Paris.
"It never comes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art" she finally says...
Fashion show of the origin
Garavani's life is a story of obsession, more than mutual liaisons.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long runway, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk, to admire a fantastic "audience", the masterpieces of Valentino wearing costumes, such as, for example, the dress that Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, chose, wore the Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls broadcasting names such as the Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino's "unforgettable" like first love.
I can remember perfectly.
It was type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because it underlines our beauty", adds ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have plenty of light and highlight the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the Princess and Meinungsführende at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola D'Arenberg can not forget the first time, as she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to have to wear one of his evening dresses, the age and the opportunity...
At the end of the 1990s it was decided finally.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that makes honor to his name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d' Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend of fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg kept their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to customize this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme authority of the press, this dress at the end of the 20th century, "the return to customers the top society" was a milestone in Haute Couture.
For many years Valentino is tarnished with the "savoir-être" the elite, now your best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L ' ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Légion d'honneur, Garavani accumulated so many honors, such as any of the husbands of his customers.
"Always be refinement, his calm, his well-groomed and perfect appearance I noticed", admits D'Arenberg.
I've seen him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no marks on him".
And this says a Princess...
The most difficult profession of the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carrier of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health on the line if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, Rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives, by they get sulphur from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen in East of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this he must descend every day on the bottom of its crater, where solidified the escaping from the Earth sulfur-containing gas in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large stones of sulfur, can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the steep paths of stone.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 m, but the depleted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at a turtle's pace, where they must keep the balance and carefully their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost your life, as happened to a French tourist, that crashed years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram sulfur, which they remove.
Once at the top, make them the way between tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run three miles with the tiresome heavy baskets up to the scales, which has set up a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1850 metres
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrences in the volcano and (never better said) exploited his workers, where 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram sulphur pays.
Which they then sold for each 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) on the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widely used and is used for the production of matches, Fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we are typically 70 kg, we get approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way", explains Abdullahi, who makes three routes normally on the day.
For each route, he needed three hours, stating that he is completely managed, at the end of the day he has but then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for a such seemingly inhuman effort, but is three times of what he would earn with the fieldwork.
"Had of the miners here, where the harvest paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income amounts to two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Abdullahi is family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned, and that with his reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java", to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hat often and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto continues three years his life on the Kawah Ijen on the game, its sulfur at the it already the first traces left, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hat often and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work two more years here because I want to make a store or learn Spanish or French", he promises a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but floggings of life young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of wearing ass.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands at two o'clock every morning, because sulfur emanates at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish shines.
Challenging the shadows, he rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he has purchased of his own money into the crater.
About 400 vehicles load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite their large profits has the mining company not mechanized reducing sulphur, to save costs, and delivers the carriers, who work on their own account and are paid according to their weight, no equipment.
You will receive also no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera charge the guardians of this natural park together with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and the human wearing ass.
"This work is for the animals and not people" protested Madrusin, a burly, 42-year-old carrier, three decades since leaving school working on the Kawah Ijen.
He is capable of carrying up to 110 kg and insure that he continues, 'as long as it is", because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not go into retirement, I'll die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and trapped the miners in the thick pillars that rise from the crater the men are so hard that no one on serious diseases complains... of course except the usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blow on their shoulders from the weight of the baskets have deformed.
With the basket on his back Unainik is with his 53 years only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions breaking 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano carried by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to camp in Tamansari 18 kilometres away.
"I will not go into retirement, I'll die here, because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains where he far opens his mouth in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest with his 30 years works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery continues generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: the who work as human carriage in the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame that they have no children on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we fulfil our duty, and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verse part of an advertisement for mints are yet - or just because of that - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The records are part of a rapper songs, of local proverbs such as "push is a"bao"(loaf) into the oven, to make you funny about the low birth rate in Singapore."
The advertising agency BBH, which has filmed the video, preserves the hope that reached the commercial in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its Creative Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to meet their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to design funny and humorous.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When planting continues, we are the worst in the world, therefore, we realized that it is a topic to which we had to take care.
We knew that the Government had tried much, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization by speed-dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but does not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why do we not something as creative as possible to address this problem, like for example a rap to compose?
1.2 Children
If you cannot easily take this topic, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it spends US$ 1,300 for policies to stimulate the citizens to have more children.
A package of the Government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech City-State in Southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national authority of the population, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
Was the last time this rate--2 - what is known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the marriage and family policy of the national population agency, says that this is due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form to have more options in terms of goals and priorities a family", she explains.
These changes in the social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single adults and delaying marriage and births, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile led an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in the migration to prevent the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where blooms the barely clad xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized, that they can keep wages low and do not integrate.
The rise in immigration is regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year posted their worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, the cost of health and immigration policy, the Singapore shows unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to achieve that not so many small flats will be built.
So, she has also impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "Shoeboxes" and may be installed in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of single adults, and that they deter the construction thereof, to build large apartment for families.
But Lim yew soon, General Director of real estate company of EL developers, says that his "shoeboxes" can be very sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units sold out faster than the larger units are days and even weeks.
As a result, they are much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give clearer guidelines to developers which previously created obstacles in the way, if you wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birthrate, the talks with the Singaporeans, who work in the financial district, is to see that they will have no great effect.
"People are highly stressed, the apartments and also the education are so it is pushed out of many expensive," says one young Manager.
The children can get the others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time" says an other, approximately twenty-year-old man.
Men and women their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for this cause that they can have no children.
Therefore the Singaporeans have since, when it comes to having children - the last word the Government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary it involves the property privately, or "area of privacy, where you have a right to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
He understands the dangers that he sits out, if he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years who are frequently on the net.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" if they applied it on the social networks.
"Would I not announce my deepest secrets in a post" says the 10-year-old Jorge when attempting to, the meaning of "private" in Web sites as Facebook, Twitter, to explain Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts in two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother should know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB, I upload beautiful images or images of games.
I dispel me also my time with acquaintances.
"I would share a photo that is not from me, or from someone who makes the fool" he says.
The boy is about to write in clear, that it is wrong, obscene photos, naked, from crime to post, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured knowing 35 friends in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and to write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if me someone responds, I only upload" he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he specifies.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone empfähle him a stranger that he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask. Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of persons that he has attached to his friend list.
"This not startle me, because we have something in common, for example music", it specifies.
According to the boy has nobody made allusions to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harassed me or calls me, I remove it easily from my user account" he admits.
José volunteered to ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
Experiences are not unknown in the boys, which is now known as cyber-bullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the account.
"He has made only private it."
Then, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathetic or I one wants to wipe out him.
"But I know that this cyber-bullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, means that it must be understood to orient the children and young people, that it is a purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet arose as a medium for searching for information; with the advent of these pages but the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras explains that the academics of Marc Prensky, holder of a Masters qualification in education at Yale University and author of the 'Digital Natives and Immigrants' forming these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that they should teach, where we learn but even," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them a defined criterion also having, what may be disseminated, published or said, and this in an age where the maturity that is not sufficient."
"You should be also picky when it is most important to them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the specialist is the most effective manner, to teach the children and young people, what is privacy to ask them questions that bring them to think.
He says "to tell them that they should not do it, doesn't".
Porras is called then some options: there are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why do you do it then on the Internet?
Or, would you like it, when it published a photo of yourself, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the other about you publish?
Have you asked before the others for permission altogether, if you've tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: all need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to understand them to announce that they must act online as they do offline.
There are the same rules.
"Is someone outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it indispensable that parents carefully read through the policies of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid basis to talk with their children about the importance of the opening of one user account on the Internet.
He says "For example, the age, or what you can share or publish".
According to Guardia, the children must be remembered the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Summit of Unasur no publication of the Declaration of Lima
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically from the seven present ruling should be signed.
Eastwood repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI ordinary session of Heads of State and Government leaders of Unasur. Sources at the heads of State and President Office shared initially with, that they would pass it after the exam, then however said that it would be released at a certain time on the Web site of the Peruvian Government.
Questions about the text, they stated that the content, was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to provide information about the Summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the President meeting without sound with the message "private session, limited audio" was transferred to the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists, were obtained by the press officers of some of the of the Unasur Governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document that was circulated during the day, was the list of the participating Presidents, causing discomfort for hundreds of various national and international media journalists demanded more information.
Then, the President of Peru sent an email with the "final Declaration" of the Summit, which however was the statement by Humala and not the official document at the end of the Summit the media.
Last October, Peru was host of III Summit South America - Arab countries (ASPA), and also on this occasion, nor was released despite the strong request by the press of the so-called Declaration of Lima, which it had announced previously.
On the official website of the ASPA they may be persuaded, that the document was released last Tuesday.
On two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for the journalists were present, they limited the access to information but to a high degree.
The Summit ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru, to accept a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague, which attaches a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the ICJ's decision, which begins on Monday in the Hague, in the process, ushered in Lima to Santiago, to listen to the arguments of both sides.
"We will follow the verdict on the differences which we currently make this International Court of Justice, and perform," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will remain a country that adheres to the international rule of law, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submits to the international courts", adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
Both President, confirmed that it would abide the ICJ, came after Colombia had filed a lawsuit against the agreement of Bogotá after a decision over the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, wherein it agreed to comply with the judgments of the International Court.
The Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present at the Summit.
Paraguay, which is excluded in 2011 after the deposition of President Fernando Lugo of the Unasur, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the Summit shortly after midday in Lima.
The head of State, made the final document wherein it announced that 16 decisions is taken and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries over a set amount of investment by a total of $17 billion.
To the taken decisions, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will undertake important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be promoted, "cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities, and against the organized to improve cross-border crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and in the case of natural disasters together and efficiently to act".
With the crisis in Europe "economic consolidation (in Latin America) accept no triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production capacity and to show our peoples a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided, sollen...und therefore unite our countries a series of 31 emblematic projects to give priority, which improve the spatial connections in South America, especially in rural and frontier areas and new economies develop," said the Peruvian President, in a statement read out.
These projects include five Peruvian, who would be on the cross of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and of which two for a better connection with Ecuador to provide, although he gave no further details.
As well, the final document made reference to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country is used for its recovery in the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded.
The necessity that Latin America continues to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was emphasized at the Summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said prior to his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict following a judgement of the ICJ of Bogotá in question, respectfully.
"Maybe I will hit me tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all of these ways – they are not exclusive, and talks with Nicaragua necessitate also the agreement with Nicaragua," he pointed out.
"I hope the President Ortega to be able to say that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the taking of Office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit, the Minister of Defense of the block to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, met in the run-up to what the dialogue and consensus in the defense of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even when the latter country is currently closed.
Peru has the chairmanship of the regional block of time.
"South America has to learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, "South America actually can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was held in Lima, told state television in Peru that where Europeans "were in the second world war and in other disputes" and "A fatherland are today virtually."
In this sense, he defended the project, to create a South American citizenship, which promote the Member countries of Unasur.
"Be achieved free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries to, as this is the case, there is already in the Andean Community still reactionary sectors, aiming at a return to the past", he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the transformation of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have subscribed to the San José Agreement on human rights.
Those who teach, undertake never to anything, and in return we will sign all the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum, which has granted the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Ecuador.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because he betrayed his principles, not so, but had met its "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that it at the time "gave reasonable guesses, that Assange's is a third country ships and its procedures not followed would."
He also criticized Swedish prosecutors, who demanded from him on its territory to take him an interrogation because of an alleged Sexualdelikts, while "The Swedish case law allows this via a video conference, which would have run through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
CORREA said that risked would compromise the health and the psychological state of Assange.
"Since he is in our Embassy, I have not spoken with him, the Ambassador, has informed me however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of State of Ecuador.
However, there is the danger that he would take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could perform any physical exercises in the open air.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
CORREA said that the solution to the asylum, since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London granted Assange, was the granting of privileges which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe's. He pointed out that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, there were however ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in hands of United Kingdom, Sweden, and the judicial authorities in Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures on various European agencies leads", he explained.
And "when Great Britain granted this carte blanche tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype interrogated Mr Assange, as it allows for the Swedish case law and was made in other cases, the problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he will not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie, which undermine the freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself, that Ecuador no longer of such journalists "and also is not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois country", and was anticipating that he "will deepen the revolution at a re-election, to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and Fradkov held no opportunism and no coup d'etat disguised as a legal", because as a result "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also maintains the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice at the Hague, which were the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua to negotiate with the law of the sea borders between the two countries, "completely justified."
Currently, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome but in the quest for a common way.
They must be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome it and look ahead.
Likewise, he relied on a good degree of disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, call international instances, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it turns out very hard."
In relation to the possibility that he is as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to achieve his third term in Office, he stated that he "sees this opportunity with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that, if he would lose the election in February 2013, he would retire from political life.
Power has personally never interested me, but under such unfair circumstances such as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was there, this likely victory guaranteed, therefore I must assume this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I retreat from public life.
The same applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa referred also to the treatment of health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I spoke with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled for a scheduled, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could again travel to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It means never relapsed in the State of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call to a higher regional integration, to ensure a sustainable progress, equality, and security.
Cause of a death due to AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed him the test results: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment in which he was diagnosed the doctor without apparent success to mitigate "tried".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of just about his illness and started to know; and this with such usage, that he celebrated just his 43rd birthday.
He is without a doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, there were many doubts, a few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, himself the Director of a clinic of the IMSS refused to say goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However still many people in the clinic, who know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already done damage and has exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 Years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success means today, that the survival of a patient in a timely manner taking the treatment, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been backed in April of this year by a reputable scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded in 2008 that AIDS was a death sentence, although, that but the years of survival and quality of life depend the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those had greater opportunities that are not drug addicts: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that who gets HIV-positive at the age of 25 years of diagnosis, "can be easily 75 years old in this sense, as long as he is under control", this expert said.
To properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate significantly has decreased in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying of AIDS, has come down from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS)), it is still true that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the advent of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco, 255 people were killed in the year 2011, and up to the month of may of this year, there are already 187 deaths; However, it is assured that there is universal access to the antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
-Why die people so still it?
-In my opinion the problem is not access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence, to the global mortality earlier diagnoses are so massively screening tests must be offered all persons where this is required, required."
Experts and officials of the Council approve this proposal Estatal de Prevención del SIDA en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio to, who had his test at a private lab, and this reason only, because a friend of his had made it, who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), what is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die, and would hear nothing.
It is said "If I must die already, then prefer three times burst", in my case.
The change was to the towards improvement, I feed myself well, do sports and take the drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
Also, I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, doing much, have an active and responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details, to animate those with his testimony that fear within the framework of the World AIDS Day today with MILENIO JALISCO enumerates.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. Once they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to can live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the commoners are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV.
And the most important is prevention.
The places for this purpose "the distribution increased actually condoms; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with one hundred pieces, which is already good, there are still people who do not have access to a condom,"he said.
Young people are among the people at risk of new infections.
"Why do you need that?" is a common question of ridicule by social workers, in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, the young people would not expose the correspondent assured orientation staff.
He proposed to orient this inefficient distribution; Condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets by facilities that are frequented by young people.
It should be encouraged not promiscuity.
It should be paid not the beer and Motel them, as the Governor Emilio González to the question answered whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not looks like this; It is best, to bring condoms to those who already engage in any sexual activity", he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is nationally seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection via sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people with HIV live, because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know it.
After the Court of appeals of the United States has confirmed a judgment, which does not recognize the restructuring of liabilities the Group vitro, which was achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a dire precedent for any national company with offices in the neighboring country, having payment problems.
So, one could say that the procedures for the survival of enterprises admitting the Mexican laws, have no validity in the land of stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice results in the recognition of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale at the Court for the Northern District in Texas that the Mexican company of the seizure of their property across the River are Bravo helplessly exposed in Bancarrotas issued on June 15.
But the decision opens the door the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, to call the Supreme Court of the United States because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case indicates that the creditor must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Court of appeals for the fifth circuit based in New Orleans first says that the main proceedings is the commercial bankruptcy discussed in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the event of the insolvency of companies with regularity profile is not known.
Actually the model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the unification of international trade law, the American Law Institute was used as a mediator.
Second determines the judgment that without the votes of the companies after recognition of liabilities in the bankruptcy estate, which had branches from vitro with its parent company, not the required majority for the restructuring of liabilities would have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the Group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) were confirmed.
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of vitro, the creditors that filed a lawsuit in the courts of the United States against vitro, had reached i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and limited Liverpool, no majority.
The vote went out 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is not considered by the Court of appeal.
On the other hand, there is guilt for his difficult situation as of 2008 as part of the big economic crisis in the United States, which granted the country beats vitro.
For this reason the family González Sada before the same Court of appeal objection, to ensure that the vote in plenary, that is by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
Is not given place, the Cerciorare opposition is filed, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the Court set aside was a document that amicus curiae (friend of the Court) was sent, which describes the procedure carried out by vitro in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies and what is pointed out by the Government of Mexico under the Figura that it is strictly to the two countries signed agreements had kept to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
Also indicates that is the country the principles of the United Nations for the International Trade Commission has subject i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Two-band Carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The GlobeTrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the Korbsport for more than 60 years combined and has travelled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a big mental collection of the history of basketball of the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in early 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes 6 years part was this sport, be it player of the National League, agent and Manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón as players of lower classes, or President of the basketball Federation.
"My life long I put on many hats me in basketball, at the same time, when I President of BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the national team and President of the Association was even more in the 1990s", Reyes recalled Hora near him during a visit by Primera home in bayamon, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that the 50s as a player until 1982 reminiscent of his time at the Vaqueros from the Middle, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a fellow Managing Director or General Manager of the Club.
"These were my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I could be as Managing Director, with business leaders or coach part of the eight Championships who was Vaqueros since 1967.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships consecutively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed me with a championship of 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
Then "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good Manager took over,"says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was hired at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2 m large players.
Do you want him?"
And that was one of the best players that ever had Puerto Rico the beginning of Mincy.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who is naturalized and was one of our best pitcher.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a Championship for bayamon, Puerto Rico, Gausse would provide for a more.
The Championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance out, because he was at the top of the Association in 1988.
At this time he preferred it from Mincy to enjoy its executions and the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the pre Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 FIFA World Cup, in which we occupied fourth place, which was to be actually bronze, if not these Canadian referee had been, let us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
1990 Was this group World Championship the best team you've ever seen?
It was among the best, as also those who in 2004 won against the dream team at the Olympics.
But, my favorite is the team of the Pan American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight team of the United States, as they did, when they won bronze at the World Championships against us.
That team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) back here, but also young players (Javier) "Tamara" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 could be due to a knee injury not included.
A team that perhaps was not the best on personalities with, but we won a gold medal and that gave us great joy, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one has so dominated in Puerto Rico at this level as Piculín.
And that's without considering his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coach like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, arm at Dito Torres.
Of the boys, the work of Leo Arill like well.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the Association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to do?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce for example only in their area of play and only meet in the national playoffs to teams from all corners of the island.
Today, the children make unnecessarily many travel and games.
At least I can see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table official and referee.
I am proud of it.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time at YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in forth worth, Texas, and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.". in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, treacherous and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose being the magnate J.R.. was Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role the most liked him," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of Thanksgiving.
Hagman Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was, when he died in the Hospital of Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He was all joy, who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," gray said in a release.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk much over the years.
in 1995 a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years leading up to "Dallas", Hagman became known in television as a nice guy in the years 1965-1970 with the sitcom "Jeannie" the broadcaster NBC.
He played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose living head will be when he meets an attractive "Djinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who is living at home with him.
He was also cast by two comedies, which aired only a short time, such as e.g. B.The good life"(NBC, 1971-72) and" here we go again "(ABC, 1973).
Among his cinema work are well valued roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors" by critics.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R.., the Hagman became a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS TV chain of the Ewing clan and other figures in their environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who scored on J.R.?" that would create anticipation for an episode full of emotion, where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars have been bet in betting houses.
Thus, the series reached a record of attendance at that time.
The answer in one of the chapters became known in November 1990, she was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" were transformed into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH", 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) sister-in-law of J.R. who had fired.
J.R. had impregnated them and threatened to present it as a prostitute if she would leave the city. But others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt and voracious man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and unfaithful husband, who sought, his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) have up to them.
"I know what should be on the tombstone of J.R..," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here lies the Honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business, which he has not won.
Victoria Principal, actress of the original series, is remembered on Friday at Hagman as a "great personality on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for a million admirers in the world and is retained in our hearts to us who were lucky enough to know him and to love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was filmed just informed the broadcaster.
Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation, how the loss would handled by Hagmann in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman Larry.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air force in England.
There, he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the Californian City of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
in 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: tall (and absolutely true) tales about my life".
"I haven't written anything, which I believed that it could hurt someone or to any wise affect him", told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet up with them, and then if their operations are imminent," he said in 1996.
I would like to donate them some comfort such as "don't worry, it is the first time a bit uncomfortable, but it will go you well".
Likewise, he campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, who studied the "end of the world"
Each week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and bacteria, and global warming.
Each semester, if the religion Professor, decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long counting down" the Mayan calendar on 21st December, which many people thought that it would mean the end of the world.
But charm had no idea what should expect him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane of sandy, which some have dubbed "Deudarmaggedon" have referred to, as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I've not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester, ever" charm of the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) said this week.
If someone analyzed what now has happened in the world, as if we were thirty days thereof, would this be a really good period.
And he pointed out that the bad news well for those with apocalyptic mentality is.
And he is not the only professor who offered this semester, which should actually be the last in the history courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple is the Professor Barry Vacker seated with the course "Media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why spread these ideas over time," he said, as well as the manner of hypothetical scenarios are offered, which lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare in comparison with real life had.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," said VACKER.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American history Matthew residual all and his colleague Amara Solari, seated in Professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "End of the world".
"We do not on 2012, we maintain always the option to hold the course for the case that the world does not" rest all said.
In spite of "impending doom", the students must study, create projects, and participate in audits.
At Penn State, the statutory audit is performed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance as "until the night to continue where the world supposedly comes to an end", said rest all.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats" rest all is said about his course for students with high average, which is filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semester begins, we received emails from students who asked whether places are free.
The students in turn assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25 year-old student Will Wekesa of psychology and nursing declared to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"Never I heard something from a classroom where this is taught", he stated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the interviewed students - and less still a professor - said to believe that the last date of 21 December.
"Our first project treated the Mayan prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year at Temple, at the age of 21 and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; There is only one key point in the calendar, rest all is said.
However, he notes that in Western society an apocalyptic fear is that traces back centuries as people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased the speculation.
"Elsewhere the people don't think so", he says.
This is the case mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion Professor, Universidad de la Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not contribute to the end of the world", he wrote a higher instance as an allusion to an exception.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Rest all pointed out that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people think immediately of a new date" or about brainfucks that the 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take lightly to this date.
Several said that they would go to parties on "the end of the world".
"Maybe I call on a few friends, so that together we can laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year old communications student.
