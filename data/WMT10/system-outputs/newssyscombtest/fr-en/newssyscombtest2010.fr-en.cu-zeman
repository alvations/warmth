Shortages of snow mountain tracasse the hôteliers
The runways désertes no quarrel problem that goes back - slopes farmers.
The lack of snow dissuade people to confront their visits to the ski in the hotels and pensions.
Thus, it is always possible to find chambers free to all dates in winter, including christmas and new year.
We have many visits on our site.
The internet parcourent bids, asking prices but dare not commit to ring for the moment.
And if we call, they ask any on if there will be to the snow or the dirt christmas, "said martin jandura, exploiting the front gate of information spindl. info.
If one wants to shift the new year of his dreams špindlerův mlýn, better no longer too hesitate to handle.
If the on gives priority to economies and that the quality of the host comes second, then you can try to expect even a few days.
The hôteliers of špindler offer for the moment that visits to a week for the new year.
I believe that they will try a moment wings, but they cèderont them also accept and shorter periods.
And then the number of free chambers will quickly reduce, "said jandura.
The vrchlabí 's agency tourism ingtours propose also still of free beds for all periods of winter.
The week before christmas we interested the more for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free of, say, half of chambers in our supply.
This is why we have already prepared some last minute of christmas visits cheaper, "said the director of ingtours petr schiefert.
The agency tourism vrchlabí can also provide the new year to krkonoše, but there is less places free.
The fourteen early days of february go well, the hivernaux visits remaining sell moyennement.
This year, the interest in the winter of visits was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still not snow to krkonoše.
People expect that it is to put to fall.
Nobody wants to shift the winter à la mountain without snow.
If the runways are recouvrent during the week, christmas also will be complete, "thinks schiefert.
On the contrary, the occupation of the horizont to pec hotel pod sněžkou is slightly higher than the last year.
On a improvement of nearly five pourcent.
We remains a few recent places for the new year as christmas.
There is a strong interest in the vacations in january of polish and february sells well, too, "amorphous karel rada, director of the best pec hotel.
The omnia near the parking hotel central of jánské lázně is also comprehensive in ninety - pourcent during the period of the new year.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty christmas in the most recent jánské hotel lázně.
This year, we were agréablement surprised by the month of january, where we have already sixty pourcent of occupation nowadays.
February is a bit more low for the moment, but as the snow will fall, the interest for the in the krkonoše visits grandira yet certainly has indicated the head of the omnia hotel, erik sporysch.
The hôteliers krkonoše will not, however, must hope more snow.
Jeudi there will be more costs, and if it a mountain of rainfall, they should be neigeuses in.
But by a result, the time should be warm, amorphous jiří jakubský of the station hradec of the czech hydrométéorologique institute.
Us: repeat is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the effort assidu with which to president barack obama 's reputation wise, replaying the afghan strategy of his predecessor, on the question, that he considered himself as a simple.
When he expected ultimately letting transpirer its wanted doctrine if, as it turned out that it had recopiée the paper carbon since the iraqi scenario of bush 's three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in iraq," he did not faltered, moreover, to use the title of bush 's speech in january 2007 as title of his own words: "a new route in before"
At the same time, he personally criticized the bush administration 's idea of sending call new backup in an iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible, and a decision catastrophic in its consequences."
The following months, however, have shown that bush 's strategy, by the recommendations of commanders campaigns, was the only possible and susceptible of success to the point that the newspapers nowadays do not speak of all of iraq.
This has not improved bush 's reputation, but, objectively speaking, he has left to his successor a situation final far more favorable than on could hope.
Barack obama hope that in afghanistan, the miracle will replicate
These are to new commanders campaigns, which have asked him a surge of contingent, including the military commander of the afghan operation, the general stanley mccristal, who has severely criticized the unwillingness of the white house despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
President a keen for three months, but in the absence of a better option, at least he had escroqué general 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extirper the promise of additional 5,000 part of europe, even if it relied on 10,000 to the origin.
Which brings the more problems in the entire strategy of obama seems his intention to withdraw the armies of afghanistan by 18 months and complete all this process by three years. all the doctrine of obama brings more questions that it provides responses.
Many doubt the fact that an increase in half cause the same fruits that the rise in iraq.
Despite the wars fratricides in recent years, the iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honorent the agreements.
The situation afghan are strikingly by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for afghan security forces, way to change leader of the day the according to which suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, would remain that of the eyewash behind which will proliferate ethnic patriarcales relations.
It is significantly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, that are still complicated by influences pakistan and iran.
Even the foundation of a "quick to act" state, which is the basis of the operation, but does not seem to be very real.
The time of the strategy of obama 's horizon makes bewildered through its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in afghanistan has only worsen and it is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war in view of their "prompt return to the house" will bring is a real miracle.
From a political point of view, define a date for troop withdrawals is purely irresponsible as the taliban regard as america 's admission indirect defeat.
The latest summit of nato has shown that the willingness of europeans to participate in military operations in afghanistan shifts towards the negative.
Europeans don 't know neither policies don' t want to explain to their own voters in what security in germany, or italy is tied to a war in the hindu kush mountains.
Another factor capable of alter radically the situation is the evolution of events associated with iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and tougher sanctions did not of effects on the iranians, americans will meet face to the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
There will respond by example at a time when, according to obama, america will come in victorious withdrawal troops in afghanistan.
Yet each solution of this type into a dramatic reversal of the afghan situation.
The only rustine for obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential election, and therefore remains enough time to print on a new strategy, in cases where it be révèlerait a total fiasco.

This 13th essay is taking place in the early normally.
It is at the end of the theft that there were again on the appareillage damage.
It is clearly the engine of the third étage the rocket that exploded.
This time, "bulava" has disappeared of the nuclear submarine dmitrij donskij which naviguait under the surface of the white sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire of a embarcation in movement and immergée
This is why the mysterious light above of norway caused by an object stealing not identified precisely the was likely by a "bulava" flawed.
The rest, norvégiens have not doubted a moment that it is a russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The two premier there 's rocket have resistance and the avarie hit that the third.
In the previous case, the engines of prime étage have experienced on failures.
Even if no of launches test happened without bumps, the direction of the ministry of defense considers only six on thirteen have been failures.
This rate of success almost fifty pourcent so emplit generals optimism and so they claim that one day "bulava" volera without problems and that it will even ten noyaux nuclear hypersoniques of a total of 1,15 tons weight.

Hyundai listened trade unions, and canceling all moonlight
The direction of the plant hyundai nošovice has put agree with the unions to cancel all moonlight.
It is precisely because of moonlight frequent that the unions have declared a state of emergency strike on monday.
The petr spokesman vaněk plant 's hyundai has confirmed.
But direction wants to go further agreement on a saturday worked with the unions this year.
We can 't renounce our plan of production, it is essential, for it is that some moonlight volunteers saturday have been proposed the 19 december knowing that there would be two teams, declared vaněk.
The site sedmička. cz has indicated that society has proposed a bonus 400 couronnes czechs workers who would part of the saturday 's team.
It will be attributed also a postériori for the day worked 28 november.
Society, according to vaněk, decided to change the way to boost its additional workers in exchange for hours.
Or they receive the extra for hours in more, they can pose a duty to replace the 28 december and prolong so their effort to end of the year aindiqué vaněk.
In addition to this all workers present the saturday receive compensation for the expense of transportation, and their lunch.
Given the fact that the moonlight were the most urgent and hot in the comments and claims of unions as workers who have stopped spontaneously production last week, the immediate direction took the decision to write all moonlight in the months of december, said vaněk.
Until the last week, workers of the automobile were forced to plant work almost daily two additional in more of their eight hours.
The unions are reversing the state of strike after agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the automobile plant and unions should be held on friday after -.
The trade union leader petr kuchař a mercredi stated that they were ready to stop the state of strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.

Czech discovery: a substance that works on the virus hiv "endurants" also
A team of scientists czechs and germans testing of new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the virus hiv into the organism.
The key advantage of the substance is that it is also on improved viruses that have already developed a immunity to drugs.
This reality is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as on the intensely variants of the virus as well as some drugs prevailing already available.
It is not possible to heal the aids nowadays.
One can nonetheless radically prolong life sick via a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the virus hiv in the body.
Yet their consumption causes a series of side effects.
More the suppression of this multiplication a effect of the development of resistant viruses what we call on which medication will have more effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the academy of sciences in the czech republic, the všcht prague and the university of heidelberg paves the way to a way to cope with hiv resistance.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the virus hiv.
The metalocarboranes are a combination of carbon bore, hydrogen, and cobalt.
This interfere with the development of the virus combination of a different way of all drugs employees so far, and this is why they could overcoming the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers improved leads to find new "substances," on the basis of their molecular mechanical knowledge of the nature of the virus on proteins.
The metalocarboranes have a single tridimensionnelle: two cages to structure multiple walls are created by the atoms of bore, hydrogen and carbon and linked by a atome metallic, in this case, the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant viruses.
The protéase hiv is a protein of hiv viruses that is indispensable the cycle of life of the virus.
Without the division of the virus hiv caused by the protéase hiv there would not birth of infectious particles mature of the virus.
If one end the protéase hiv, it also stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain researchers press in a statement issued by the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the academy of sciences the czech republic.
In their work published in the journal science journal of medicinal chemistry, scientists describe a series of cages combinations where two members (cf. picture) are linked by a court organic link, which is then systematically changed.
A bit more weak but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substance on the protéases hiv has been tested in éprouvettes as well as its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with hiv / aids.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not so high that clinical on drugs, however, the other not on the current versions resilient against which drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their mechanism single action and other chemical and biological properties as their stability, their weak toxicity, and the possibility of other chemical changes are so combinations interesting to examine more to move to the development of effective medicines against hiv, argues pavlína řezáčová, laboratory director of biology structural the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the molecular institute of genetics of the academy of sciences.
Dispute surrounding the budget. the right takes on to fischer, which is defending
The president of the right (civic democratic party), mirek appalling topolánek has accused of "" ratified the budget for the next year and according to him, prime minister jan fischer 's government should in jeopardy its existence.

The czech republic should run a deficit of 163 billion couronnes.
The right has left the courtroom before the vote, obeying as well as what a budget changed in the desire of the government is a variant less bad that un interim budget.

His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the right.
If fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, nečas believes that the representatives of the čssd, which have imposed changes in the budget, did not their place in the government.
Prime minister should also make clear that it quit if the house ratifie other laws increasing the deficit such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: the appointed by the right ministers are not in cause.

That said, it should not expect to support and tolerance of democrats.
There i not thinking and once it to be the order of the day when i consacrerai, said since the house of journalists, the defense minister martin barták, elected government correctly by the democrats.
Prime minister fischer has soared in the european council 's post - on to a debate in brussels.
The right has been reversed at the behest of prime minister.
At the same time nečas has emphasized that the right probably would have voted mercredi against the budget changed if it were not explicitly asked deputies democrats to allow the vote budget.
We don 't the sense of being of orphaned, there is not the small children, he responded to the question of whether the right reproach did not suffered from the president of the party in the house, or in the country during the negotiation of budget.
I don 't have noticed that my vote would have been missing.
I knew already at a time when i conceded that my term follow in the months would be a bolchévisation of house and the destruction of all that there was positive, responded topolánek in person.

The trains express are commissioned and paid by the ministry of transportation, and versera railroads the next year 's four billion in all of couronnes to settle the losses visible, is the same amount that this year. the regional trains are commissioned by the regions will pay for their a total next eight billion a year, knowing that the state participate worth nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railroads have newly signed a contract for ten years, so far duration was always a year.
The railroads like the system, which also explains that they would not have resorted to a rising prices of the great majority of securities transport.
The changes affect only the money to a day čd net internet and the money to prices reduced eliška.
For travelers buy without carte reduction, the price of čd net rise 450 to 600 couronnes.
The price of eliška will newly depend on the journey parcouru, while previously, it was valid between cities to a region in choices and was a unique prices to 160 couronnes.

The second male role of the legendary champion sudafricain rugby has been assigned to matt damon.
With the film 's arrival in rooms, the returns of critics and public are heard.
Nelson mandela
Full of its name nelson mandela rolihlahla, he was born in the 18 june 1918 mvezu south africa.
In 1988 sakharov he received the price for its freedom of mind, in 1993 he received then the nobel peace beside de klerk.
It has been south africa 's president of 1994 - 1999.
The film contains of great expectations, because it is presented at a time when a part of the south africa is in full preparations for the world cup of football, and other part because the media are by ominous new uneasy about rising racial conflicts and discrimination of the people of the part of the majority black power.
According to the pa agency, the new film reactions are for the moment rather positive in south africa, despite the frequent reserves issued to the roles major where "pavanent" stars hollywoodiennes.
Nevertheless, morgan freeman is, for its own terms, proud of the film.

The film based on the history of roman of the british writer, john carlin the title because freely reflects. in the role of the enemy: nelson mandela and the people who gave its creation depicts the sudafricain of human rights defender during his tenure to the presidency.
So morgan freeman trying in the film of dumpty two racial groups of a long divided population and that even nelson mandela in 1995 it between vêtu of swimming of national team sudafricaine on the lawn of the world cup, south africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn swimming, which is regarded in south africa as something of mandela sacred, had been long ovationné fourteen years ago mainly of public white, and has been recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the championship football manages to unite people to one nation, a new indicating the rugby player chester williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the situation sudafricaine tense will improve.
The white south africans, however, are skeptical as recently complained in an interview for ln christopher dawson, fan of rugby who fled to britain.
The championship begins the 11 june 2010.

The complaint is linked to society 's attempt to exploit of regional railroads in some regions.
But all regions have fini by sign of long - term contracts with the railroads czechs.
All three we attacked and say that the fines on fact mouths, while the on a only a bid for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the railroads czechs, which is not true because we know the price of railroads czechs that have been signed last week.
So we remain more than to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the vilified him on society student agency, a declared jančura on radiožurnál.
Likewise, he indicated have some evidence that no region a process in accordance with the european right.
We prepared for this a complaint for the european commission.
Hašek regards deposit complaint mr. jančura is the result of his media spectacle that serves free publicity for its society and to its person.
Of course, i am willing to defend my name and the name of the region and i call the other préfets to do likewise.

The vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and facultative
The vaccination against the pneumocoques renversera the old habits from january.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time facultative for families.
Already the voices, arguing that an obligatory vaccination would be more efficient.
The vaccine preparations for the introduction of the free against the pneumocoques culminent.
The pharmaceutical defines already institute for the insurance vaccines maximaux that prices will pay the disease.
Experts are also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children of august.
Since january, the last year 's children born from the 2 august can be vaccinated against the pneumocoques gratuitously.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccination.
If the on began vaccination last year or more self - sooner, we will have to pay the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine must be administered between the eighth graders and the 5ème months of the child.
The last year 's already a quarter of a families voluntarily vaccination its children against pneumocoques.
Yet the parents paid 1600 couronnes even more for a dose.
The vaccination younger requires four doses.
Experts argue that each year insurance disease spend 300 to 450,000 couronnes doses of vaccine.
Yet they save on the medical care that children not vaccinated nécessiteraient.
So far, state dépensait about 500,000 couronnes per year for the entire vaccination children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the "two janota."
The pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the average ear, but also serious infections whose inflammation méninges and the empoisonnements blood.
According to surveys in hospitals, there was previously 28 death of children of less than 10 years caused by pneumocoques infections.
Apart from the czech republic, roughly 40 other countries have introduced the vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be compulsory it?
There are views about a possible vaccination obligation to the future.
From january, it must be addressed by insurance and facultative.
, for example, the president of the association nahlas rudolf kalovský has said that an obligatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association promotes long immunization against the pneumocoques.
In an international conference to which our association has participated, scholars have not been really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination facultative.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been impose at least this.
I believe that it is a direction that it must now follow a declared kalovský.
But the ministry of health does not change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques.
We will not envision absolutely for the moment, a declared its vlastimil spokesman sršeň.
The vaccination facultative has its flaws, doctors claim.
Hana cabrnochová, president of the company specializing pédiatres, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, one could envisage lowering turnover of vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum i understand the decision making the vaccination facultative cabrnochová, however," says.
Experts predict that next year, more than 80 pourcent of new parents will vaccinate their intervention.
The vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a rupture also the fact that it is the first vaccination of children who is financed by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová that explain the insurance should free of funds for prevention, they économiseraient so on possible future medical care.
Physicians will have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the problem of pédiatres practitioners, however, that address the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by the insurance, doctors receiving of the same way that other vaccine products provided by the state.
Yet some deputies feared that this would enable the assurances of "deduct the amount of health insurance."
Thus, doctors to buy products and expect that insurance them pay.
Estimates that, individual pédiatres must invest nearly $40,000 couronnes per month in vaccines, which is a sum important.
It is far from it be easy, according to cabrnochová.
Still, and we
Islam can be french?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger bootle, deloitte
Some readers will be lured by this new book, fans in the last book of the french author, "why don 't like the headscarf" (2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that a divided and preoccupied the country for 15 years and the effects are still feel today.
The latest book of mr. bowen presents a broad plotting far more and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it would not only know what politicians and the media say about islam in france, but what is happening now in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools, and the institutions that provide now in france quem. bozen called "muslims" to 5m spaces - 6m of muslims.
He knows well listen and reproduce the between teachers, and students debates on the issues that concern the more.
A muslim must be marrying in a mosque or to the council (or both)?
Evolution and the rights of homosexuals must be enseignés to young muslims?
A woman muslim may marry non - muslim?
A muslim can use a banking system based on the interests to get a loan?
These problems, he says, practices that are the occurrence,, rather than the dramas political issues that concern the media.
The author discern a new generation of imams, teachers, and of unknown, all of the great public intellectuals, except perhaps tariq judaism, a muslim arab born in switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on the way to be both good and a good muslim citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a french or european islam.
Thinkers and activists who have been interviews by mr. bowen are usually islam in accordance with their counterparts lawyers' a sunni puriste associated with saudi arabia that nowadays, constitute a small part of muslims in europe.
Mr bowen estimates that the values of muslims and secularism of french could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of individual camp.
He wonders how the french politicians (and the intellectual elite gardienne if strain of secularism) are actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, muslims have not been endowed, compared to, the protestants and catholics jews who have also been to make historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a pragmatism, it détecte a growing "narrow key values."
Islam can be french? after reading of the book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The world 's view the darker
The arctic change faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice that compose is being squeezed at a rate alarming, emportant with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, the fishing expeditions and sail in new waters open, with the diplomats, lawyers, and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin coat of ice", richard ellis, and illustrateur writer, peint a natural history of the symbol of grand north, the polar bears.
Knowledge of history and political complicated to the whale fishing, he described the long tradition of the arctic explorers which were their demonstrated in driving the ours white.
The meeting of the admiral nelson, then courageous aspirant 14 years that had to fight the tip of its mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons, captured while they nageaient alongside their mother, just murdered, were caught and sent in zoos, and cirques.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a spectacle famous contained 75 ours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always generally a millionième of the surface necessary to an adult in freedom. climate is rarely indicated: a polar bears living in singapore became green because of algues that drove in its fourrure épaisse.

Mr. ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat that constituent fighter on the survival of species.
Although forbidden in norway, america and in russia, the killings continue to groenland and canada where fighter helicopter and indians inuits in motoski use of fusilsd assault powerful to cast their gibier.
Ironically, it is in the more north waters of these two nations of the manhunt that the ice will remain the longer.
In his new book, "after the ice," alun anderson, a former editor - in - chief of new scientist, offers a summary clear and frightening the science of the arctic and a glimpse exciting of what may be the future - - low.
Not that scientists have all responses.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the océanographes cannot recount with accuracy the pace of change.
This is not to try.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of fridtjof nansen have given the first report on the melting of the polar ice cap.
The cold war submarines then cartographié changes in relief under - - it.
The satellite surveillance and sondes placed on the icebergs are a great help, but the biggest labor is by genetic men, campant in the cold.
Mr. anderson contemplate le monde extraordinary and minuscule coexists system of the arctic ice, formed by the nets water saumâtre hurry by keeping.
But the ours mentioned above the marvels microscopic locked in the mirror, all will be lost with the disappearance of the planned ice summer, between 2013 and 2050.

The society works on projects for clients, such as the u. s. agency for international development and the world bank.
The authorities consular as well as the u. s. interest section to havana try to have access to the detainee, which has been stopped the 5 december.
Public accusations accurate have not been made, although under cuban law, a citizen cuban or foreign visiteur can be arrested, alleging d 'être "dangerous".
All the activities so - called revolutionary, comprising moderate protests and written criticism, causing the risk of a arrest.
The graffiti anti - government and the speeches are regarded as a serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, led by yoani sánchez, commentatrice popular who writes often on how are husband and they are followed and harassed by the government 's agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to move receive rewards but licenses have always been denied him.
The detention of an american ressortissant may increase the tensions between the communist government brothers with cuba and the obama administration who pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first rapportée by the new york times, friday night.
The new american policy insists that the cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as liberate the political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the us can make the pareille.
Cell phones and computers phones are allowed to cuba, although it either goods new and wanted in a country or the average wage of an official is of $15 per month.
Only this year, the cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for the textos or a conversation of 15 minutes which corresponds to wage a day.
On the island, the use of the internet is extremely limited.

The pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men in afghanistan
On saturday, the pakistani authorities have circling an organization supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of north virginia in afghanistan in the but to kill american troops, arguing that they hoped that this affair would demonstrate a network of important recruteurs of terrorists who écument research internet of young men radicalized.
The investigators have said that they chasing a hidden insurgente personality, known as the name of saifullah that a invited these men pakistan after the have found when one of them has waves of comments approving terrorists on the site of video youtube on the internet.
Came in pakistan, these men were guided by saifullah who tried to help to join the region remote of pakistan 's tribal belts, household of al - qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret pakistanis who has been informed saturday 's case said that saifullah had not managed to convince the commanders of al - qaeda that these men the participants not plot of the cia to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they have been isolated in the city east for days of north sargodha, far mountains prohibited - has become a refuge of terrorism.
They have been seen as agents infiltrated.
This is why they have been dismissed, a declared a representative of the authorities that has expressed the condition to keep the anonymity, owing to the confidential character of the case.
The representative of a authorities claimed that men were determined and that they were always get the licenses required to get the membership in the camps of al - qaida when they have been arrested pakistan by the forces of law.
The case of these five men - - who remain in pakistan and are asked by the fbi - - recruteurs insist on the crucial role in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps most importantly, in the determination of people in which its trust.
Since the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, the secret americans have had to priority to leak men in the al - qaeda network.
The recruteurs of the organization play the role of guards -, refused entry barriers to those who do not show a serious engagement and those who can prove spies.
According to the analysts, the us recruits potential are studied almost by al - qaeda.
But they are also very attractive potential for the group, owing to their access to american and their value propagandaire targets.
However evan kohlmann, an expert on the foundation nefa based in the us, has said that the terrorist groups must also be more and more attention, in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the secret americans have become experts in regard their methods of recruitment.
If you attempt to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow his model of recruitment that so many other people have already followed? kohlmann said.
The model is one that is increasingly on the internet.

The police prevented the protesters from come too close to the center bella and has said that she had arrested 19 people on the grounds wearing a mask or that they were in possession of knives pockets.
According to a shift who has asked to keep the anonymity, owing to its involvement in discussions about the climate, activists who focused black masks and clothes, have allumé several explosives near the principal canal in copenhagen that is surrounded by a few ministries.

A inside the palace of congress, people were assembled around to follow the march television screens, throughout the after - on.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to revive the conscience of key authorities like su wei, china 's representative to climate change.
When he was asked if he believed that a demonstration have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in english "in fact, it is something that i had not conscience.
He then continued mandarin, declaring "the event is important, i can 't hear what happens to the outside."
He observed that the march could seem damaged or useful according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the great public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he says.
On the other hand, "you can also mean that they disrupt the negotiations, or that they hurt the freedom of others."
The results of tests reveal departures stubborn among races
The last week federal report on the results in mathematics has provided a good news for public schools in washington d. c.
Although the district is still far behind the institutions of mind, the report shows that grade 4% and grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as atlanta, chicago, and new york.
But what the last figures of national assessment of educational national progress (evaluation of progress of education) is the gap between the results of the ongoing african - americans and white, on the plans to both local and national.
The results means children white grade 4 (cm1) in washingtond. c. rose, over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their fellow african - american class have risen than three points, 209 to 212.
The success has actually increased gap between 2007 and 2009, from 53 58 points.
The progress of african - americans in grade 8 (4th) remains largely constant, tombant only a point, 245 to 244.
The outcome means white has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The sight of all over a period of six years is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between the black and white in class of grade 4 (cm1), when the first report naep the district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results for children in the two groups have increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the district have expressed concern that increase célébrée by the director of michelle a group of education institutions. rhee and mayor, mr. fenty adrian (democrat) were propulsés by the students white who were already good things.
This would mean that we have high agrégat viewing elements at the height of the scale, which is problematic and gênant, a dit jeff smith, director of d. c. voice non - profit, a group that defends the district 's equality in education.
I do not leaps joy to one or two points won, declared kwame r. brown (related democrat), a member of the council of d. c. and that the daughter is grade 4, to eaton elementary (school basic).
Often critique of style of management rhee, brown has declared that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools (school) of the city desperately need attention.
Really you wish, always see the positive signs and i respect.
But what makes fear, it is that we do not consacrons enough time and energy to our middle schools (school).
Rhee has declared that the district must continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in trouble.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of wilson reading, the reading system, aimed schoolchildren classes of late cycle basic and beginning of college that have not integrated bases of the lecture earlier in their path school and which are relatively behind relative to their cronies.
Every day, the program of mathematics, for the classes of kindergarten maternal () to grade 6 (sixth) emphasizes the games and the experiences of the real life, such as they have been implemented in the district by former responsible clifford janey, which must also be crédité for the progress of naep reported last week.
I think simply that we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these pupils level than the class, rhee said.
Others argue that the results of naep raise the question of whether rhee can continue to raise the results of the system in providing money generals and the resources to schools with less performance to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for michelle rhee, a dit bruce fuller, a formateur teaching at the university of california berkeley in which explores the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and your management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods in washington.
So it may have repercussions policies that blocking targeting this important program.
But the problem, of course, is as other superintendant schools, it tries to use the black and white middle class.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.

It appears that a us missile, having struck along the border with afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of operations of al - qaeda, this week, authorities have declared friday of us the counter - intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, this is the second deadly attack against a of terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al - somali was one of the two men arab suspicion of have been killed by a pair of missiles engaged in their cars, by tuesday near the city of miran shah, in the province of north waziristan pakistan, according to the us sources and the authorities in the region.
The local authorities have argued that the missiles had been drawn by a plane pilot without the type used by the cia, inside pakistan 's anarchic tribal of the border.
They conduisaient a car white leader to the afghan border, when the car was struck, declared a member of the pakistani secrets civilians services, expressing the telephone of miran shah.
Representatives of the authority have declared that the local militants suspects hand on place and quickly confiscated the remnants of "body entirely déchiquetés."
It has been fully impossible to the local authorities to check the identity of the victims, but the two anti - terrorist americans have given representatives of evidence not spécifiées that somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as the un officials organizers' s military operations ruling al - qaeda terrorists of the region 's group outside afghanistan, pakistan.

He said that he wanted to prevent the united nations.
The secretary general ban ki - moon now knows that it is time to find a successor.
I simply says that it is better to start to seek my successor, eide said.
When i come here, there had been a vacuum of two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the un, ban has already begun to seek a successor.
Officials say that the name of staffan di mistura was cited; it is a italian - switzerland who has recently chaired a citizen of the un mission in baghdad and jean - marie guéhenno, a french who led the earlier un peacekeeping operations.

Gates: iran must show additional sanctions
Mr. secretary of defense robert gates a friday declared that the world 's major powers would soon impose "additional sanctions important" on iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressing before a floor of 300 us soldiers in the north of iraq, during a visit to a week in the areas of war in afghanistan and iraq, a dédramatisé the possibility of a military action against the islamic republic.
There is no good option in iran, he said that, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. falling
One of the things that me weighs more, is that if i learned something in iraq during the past six years, it is the hand unpredictable inherent to the war.
The obama administration is a set of sanctions that viseraient iran 's political and military elite, but gates warned that some of these sanctions could also affect the iranians in the streets.
He declared that a "set of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the iranian government that it is in fact less good with security of nuclear weapons, "as" its people suffer none of these sanctions.
Friday, in a declaration of the white house spokesman, robert gibbs, the administration has joined the european leaders in a warning that iran will face "likely consequences" if he doesn 't been full its nuclear program in conformity with the united nations security council and his body of surveillance, the international atomic energy agency (iaea).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful but.
In geneva talks, on october 1, he indicated that it reprendrait dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear program and accepted to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium fuel, in exchange for desperately needed to a reactor of medical research.
The administration has gone such an agreement, way to develop a confidence of both sides and to buy time for talks.
Since then, iran appears to be removed the attempts of agreement - in part, experts say, because the iranian leadership is divided on the fact or not to engage with the united states.
Frankly, according to me, the raidissement iran 's face to some of the international community proposals for which they were in fact given their agreement in early october, pushed the international community, including the russian and chinese, to join on what they did not envisioned important, in terms of additional sanctions against the iranians, declared gates.
President obama has set the december 31 like iran deadline to meet the proposals, before it has turned to other options, including the pursuit of what the secretary of state hillary rodham clinton has once called "sanctions accrues."
In a declaration jeudi in new york, iran 's mission to the un has denounced what it calls "the allegations sand" some members of the security council on the nuclear activities of iran and said that it was agreed to continue the talks with the us and global five other great powers, "to get a satisfactory long - term" solution.
Gates, which was to return to washington late friday, a met the morning, iraqi prime minister nouri al - maliki, before take the plane for the oil rich region kurdish so derencontrer officials troops to kirkuk, kurdish and irbil.
Tensions between the kurds and the arab majority persist in iraq, especially concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of income.
Gates has urged the two parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to prevent all retards the us plans to reduce the number of american troops, 115 100,000 to 50,000 before the end of the month of august.
Gates also wants calmer anxiety of kurds regarding the withdrawal unresolved. american authorities cited gates called to massoud barzani, president of the regional government of kurdistan: "we maintaining your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified iraq."
We do not you abandonnerons. "
Aging in china, a change of direction
Wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded poster of propaganda sermonnant, "the earth mother is too tired to welcome more children" and "a baby in more, it is a down".
They have learned the lesson so well that the government 's authorities in shanghai, alarmées by the fertility rate insufficient their city and by the aging population, have changed radically direction this summer and began to encourage the young couples to have more than a child; their response has been instant and firm: ever.
We already given all our time and energy to a lone child.
We remains no second, a dit wang 31 years, director of human resources and which has a son of eight months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child "policy in china, creating two generations of the unique notoriously with good joues and spoiled children, dubbed" small emperors ", a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the un, the average fertility rate fell from 1.8 children per couple relative to six when the policy has been implemented.
The allocation of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more bursts, 16,7% of the population in 2020 31,1% in 2050. this figure is well above the average of around 20%.
This imbalance is worse in the rich with a highly educated population, coastal cities like shanghai.
Last year, the people of 60 years, and more accounted for roughly 22% of the population of residents registered in shanghai, while the fertility rate was less of a child by couple.
Xie lingli, director of the shanghai municipal population and family planning commission (commission of the population municipal shanghai and family planning) has declared that the couples fertile should have babies order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labor in the future."
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "as old - but not as rich, however - developed countries like japan, and sweden" a - - she says.
A mitigation progressive
Written in the country 's constitution in 1978, china one - child policy is to this day, without rival, the obligation most controversial introduced by the communist government.
This is the policy couples who transgressent may have to pay colossal fines - - until three times their annual income - - and to undergo discrimination in the workplace.
The chinese authorities have attributed to police the obligation to help the country to avoid a trend dangerous for natural resources, while the human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority of pregnant women have forced a second child to abort.
Moreover, many couples eu resort to abortions selective leading to a ratio boys - girls anomalously high.
In recent years, the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one - child "policy.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions for the rule - - including the résidants cities, members of ethnic minorities and the case in which the man and women are already children unique - - and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans hard.
Qiao xiaochun, professor to institute of population research (institute of research on the population), to the beijing university, has recently declared that the central government 's authorities have discussed more radical changes, such as allow couples to have two children if it is a child unique un partners.
In july, shanghai became the first chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage the births.
In a little time, the posters spurring families to having a lone child have been replaced by copies of regulations, detailing, which has the right to a second child, and how the demand for permission.
The city 's government has hurried officials in the family planning and volunteers to meet couples, to their homes, and slipped prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide advice psychological and financiers to those who would have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Response disappointing
Although rural officials in a city of the suburbs of shanghai say that they saw an increase in the demands of records of couples wants a second child after the launch of the campaign, urban district more has reported that there was no change.
The common huinan, with a population of 115 10,000 people, for example, is always only four to five demands per month.
Officials in shanghai, disappointed, say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the town, by 2010, is always expected be than about 165 10,000 - - slightly larger than 2009 but less than in 2008.
Feng juying, responsible for the committee of family planning in the shanghai, a common caolu declared that the financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want to have more children.
They want to to their first child, a - - she says.
Yang jiawei, 27 years and his wife, liu juanjuan 26 years ago, have declared that they adoreraient two children, and that they are legally allowed.
But, like many chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The western mistakenly see that the one - child "policy is a problem of rights, said yang, an engineer in construction whose pregnant wife is seven months of the first child of couple.
This is true, we steals the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other pairings cite psychological to explain their hesitation reasons.
Wang, responsible human resources, has said that she wanted to only one a child, because it was a itself. "we were the center of the family and airplanes used that everyone deals with us."
We don 't the habit of take care of someone else, and we do not wish to really take care of other. "
Chen zijian, 42 and owner of a society translation more puts it crudely.
For the couples working to two, middle - class, which are lower fertility rates, he said, it should be selfish pourbien succeed.
People in 10 or 20 years have grown to see their parents fight in the first time china 's capitalist and do not want to have themselves the style of life, he said.
Even a lone child demand a lot of time of his parents, he said.
A mother must abandon social at least two years of his life.
Then there are problems of space - - "you have to alter your apartment" - - and planning - - "when your child a 9 months, you have to write her resumés to get a place in the best maternal."
Most of its friends are willing to this experience chen once, says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to be too many sacrifices.
The united nations a group of projects plans for reducing emissions
The climate, ward off the un - sponsored conference - - so far characterized by special désorganisées and recriminations mutual - - is revenue under the fires of the rampe friday, owing to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious cuts of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with the industrialized épaulant most of the charge, in the next time.
The text that could provide the foundations of a political agreement final to regulate greenhouse gases, has emphasized the remaining obstacles, as much as it has been the path to take.
But it has been seen as an important step in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world took the next week in copenhagen.
Produced by a group of the un special work, the text does not say how the rich would give poor countries to bear warming, over and over the long term.
And it offers a broad range of options for the key issues, including the way the advanced economies and emerging economies new could decrease their superior carbon production and what is the limits of the increase in global temperature that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It provides a flexibility in the process, said àwashington representative, john coequyt of sierra club.
Michael zammit cutajar, which has produced six pages of document, a studied a text of 180 pages talks to focus on what described the secretary general executive on climate change of the un, yvo boer, as "the comprehensive image."
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, 25 to 45% relative to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduce their from 15 to 30%.
Together, the countries reduce emissions between 50 and 95% in 2050.
The european union has also led the negotiations, friday, by promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - - to bear floods and droughts or for avoided deforestation.
However, friday, the same altercations verbal occurred, who have dominated the negotiations since the last week.
Todd stern, representative of the united states to the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion forcing the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries, in comparison with voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if it were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the obama administration becomes more hard to china that the bush administration has been, two years ago.
The us will not an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, stern that regrettait also that the text insists not enough to ensure that the cuts could be vérifiées by outsiders.
Stern has made his comments an hour after the chinese deputy prime minister of foreign affairs, he yafei has declared that the us chief negotiator, either lacked "common sense," or "was" extremely irresponsible for having told earlier in the week that the us will not help financially china to combat climate change.
With the future of the major powers, global economic trajectories at stake, defaults appeared to third - world both within and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with china and the us will querellant in their respective bonds, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that both dozens of countries more influential ignore the imperatives scientists to act more bravely.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from costa rica, has said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting for know who should bear the costs of the diminution of greenhouse gases, even if the country vulnerable became more aggressive in their attempt to make the major issuer accountable for their actions.
It is really a stake in which is developed a new economic hegemony, ulate said, which is also advisor climate for mexico and central america for international conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they continue to put pressure to get a treaty forcing legally, in copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The alliance of small states that unites 43 members, wrote a proposed 24 pages, sooner friday morning.
Artur runge - metzger, chief of the unity of the european commission climate action, said that the small states a "comprehensive put a political pressure on the political process," in part by what they are now unified and that they require to emerging economies such as china and india, to act.
Debates have become an urgent matter, whereas the delegates will concentrated on the fact that they had to address the most problems in instance before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
High - level officials like the indian environment minister, jairam ramesh and the chinese deputy prime minister took of their aircraft and hand in the building of bella center for attend meetings in camera - closed and conferences of information, in order to make réclamations that will be studied over the next week.
The real image of the assembly - - during which 13,000 people in and out of the congress palace each day - - activists players in guitare present spectacles night making fun of the countries that to themselves, trahissent and proposals are written and distributed on paper, rather than by emails - - is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all important ministers are here, and no later than mercredi, 60 heads of governments will be in copenhagen.
We are entering the big, a court declared carlos manuel rodriguez, vice - president for the world 's political international conservation.
The heavyweights come.
In britain, the first train 25 miles away / h will redefine the on monday syndrome
A 5h13, on monday morning, a coup de virtually percera the night to signal the departure of a train that mark a revolution of transport in britain.
The country 's first with a high - speed train of suburban reach 25 miles away / h, while it filera of ashford, in the kent, in london st pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord adonis, the minister of transportation, will be joined by lady kelly holmes on the first javelin outside london suburbs.
He hopes that the new service helps to britain to integrate a network of international trains quick and reliable and reliera the great conurbations midlands north, and scotland in london.
The small holes lost will become cities of suburban booming, the time of business travel will be far less long and the passage of the plane and the car in national train reduce emissions of carbon while reducing the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion of books needed to build a new railways, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers for the environment can stop the lines to high - speed british.
According to the times, high speed two (hs2), a society that was created to the government in january to achieve a feasibility, make its report to lord adonis the december 30 document.
It will get a detailed map of the course of the next step scheduled for the network to high - speed.
The new line connecting london in west midlands will be drawn in the five feet of urban zone and sites where the impact on the environment will be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final course.
It is also expected that hs2 presents three options for a greater networks to high speed, ranging to the north.
Lord adonis satisfy spring.
The options are put forward in a special configuration y why a line in high - speed ira until the west midlands.
The line has séparera in two at or near birmingham, with a branch ranging towards the west of pennines àmanchester and scotland and another ranging towards north is, sheffield, leeds and newcastle upon tyne.
A single across scotland line.
"it seems that will be the best option of performance said a professional rail.
When it will be over, the time of trip between london and edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which does not before 2025, will open to all the passengers travel between london and birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip to an hour now.
The proposals will to train of travel to 400km / h, making the world 's network british the faster.
The demarcation initial is designed to enable trains of 400m length and can transport 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can work on a line london - birmingham.
A terminal can afford 20000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Because constraints of data space, it is expected that a bus terminal existing will be expanded to receive the network in high - speed.
The experts industry rail claim that only st pancras international or euston offer this possibility.
Lord adonis annoncera if it or not believe that the project should be put in place, but of public consultations longer and procedures planning mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it makes the machine, partly the network will need to be built by part.
The trains will be first forced being attempt to ride out of lines to high - speed on existing rails north of birmingham, retaining shorter voyage from london and scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a passage airplanes trains, representing a reference point for the rail revolution.

Economic revolution managerial or end of the ’ intelligence?
If nothing change in the governance of the great french companies, our struggle for economic development of the ’ intelligence have been vain ….
For more than a decade ’ of ’ years, the ’ attitude of the management of big business vis - à - vis its workers, reminds the position of companies vis - à - vis consumers before the revolution marketing: he ’ is to join the collaborators to "values" determined ’ in high as it is ’ were once, ’ impose on the consumer products pensés by the mechanics of the ’ factory.
By putting the client at the heart of the ’ enterprise, the marketing revolution has called the strategies conquest of markets ’ place. although the authoritarian temptation of ’ impose factors products out of touch of preferences of clienteles return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a démoralisation mortifère.
The suicides in france telecom, psa or renault are only the tip of ’ a much more general that touches in particular the phenomenon cadres.
This demobilization affecting severely the development of all ’ intellectual functions of the company, including r & d and, more importantly, the economic ’ intelligence.
Indeed, the ’ ie "requires all stakeholders (…) of a step proactive and a vision prospective"; it requires the part of employees a commitment that the revenues management authoritarian overriding totally.
It ’ is why we call to a managerial revolution that is to put the collaborators at the center of concerns about the ’ company at the same way that the client.
The ’ usefulness any relative investigations of ’ internal opinion
The surveys of ’ opinion internal – as the orange questionnaire submitted by its workers - - they will incite this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, i am afraid that not.

- second, because the ’ authoritarianism – a of pathologies power - growing relative to the ’ importance of its own failures.
Third, because most political leaders have a simplistic view of the human behavior.
From grandes écoles of ’ engineers, they have a mécaniste interpretation of psychology.
They embrace, by comfort intellectual, the old theory behavioriste, reactivation recently by the "neuroscience" states - uniennes and largely channels, by their knowledge, the institutions of ’ studies and the media.
So, in suggesting that ’ it is possible to manier "(the" leverage sic) of the ’ settings, a recent survey commitment to ’ ipsos parue in le figaro. fr strengthening - - it leaders in a posture of governance mécaniste, unfit the world ’ ’ today.

On the contrary, the revolution managerial necessary to the functioning of modern companies, suppose of ’ adopt a vision finaliste of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning, or practice of governance, a fundamental: for workers, the realization ’ commitment to the ’ company ’ is possible that if it is clear as a way to achieve a part of their dreams, ambitions, their projects.

When on in the war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the killing of innocents, he warned.
But the press center - left remained élogieuse to the president 's place.
The los angeles times, while continuing to believe that the nobel was awarded to mr. obama prematurely, has called his address to "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide decisions against the international conflicts, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the daily californian.
Mr. obama "made the speech that he had," said the new york times, the ruling "both dark and uplifting."

The new "silicon valley"
For a long time it was the city 's reputation, secret forbidden to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in moscow,, under the soviet regime was the research, a place ’ secret armaments, under strict surveillance.
Today ’ hui with its 216 10,000 people to 37 kilometers of the center of moscow, a common the reputation ’ be soviet "silicon valley.
Important places of production and research in micro - and nanoélectronique are implanted.
From september 2008 representatives of zelenograd have created ties with riedberg, instead of sciences francfortois – with the academic and societies institutes of ’ innovations center of frankfurt (fiz).
There has been meetings directions and mercredi last representatives of zelenograd and riedberg have ratified a "protocol ’ closely."
The signatories were the moscow juri deputy mayor rosljak and the préfet anatoly smimov zelenograd to russian delegation, edwin schwarz head of section project in frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the fiz and small, whose strong point is the scientific research, leave zelenograd for a course.

But also of economic relations.
It will allow russian companies from fiz to go on the market in full expansion.

The project s21: a disincentive to stuttgart
We cannot place enough above the magnitude of the project stuttgart 21.
For its supporters there is nothing less than "new center of europe ’."
If the ’ you want. s21, it ’ is far more than the ’ enfouissement of ’ a bus terminal, more than a construction colossal railway that will plunge the heart of the capital of bade - wurtemberg, in a chaos disillusioning sites for a decade ’ years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the ’ spirit of the 1980s.
The gares lead in line, with paths terminaient in full city, had the reputation at the time to be the relics of technique transport nineteenth - century that were effect of sabot drag trafficking modern railway because he had once a lot of time to put the engines of the ’ back to the ’ before.
Migrated, halt court, starting – c ’ is that must be done.
This is why the gares head of ’ line must disappear: in frankfurt and munich.
And stuttgart also: a bus terminal passage of trains, who is about mid - way on the magisterial transeuropéenne of rail between paris and budapest / bratislava, where the slogan "heart of europe."
The realization of s21 project will really start, although the visions of the 1980 's long are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the planners more ambitious have recognized that the cost, for enfouir bus terminal in the capitals respective of hesse and america, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the gares heads the line pose no longer truly of problems of ’ entry and exit from that modern ’ there are trains, reversible with autorails and car - pilot at both ends.
But on launches far the realization of stuttgart 21 to side of the new carved out of the inter - city to ulm line.
The regional and communal the ’ policies have prevailed.
The company of railroads is in part because, this taxpayer ’ is the fact that the costs of the risks of greater project of ’ infrastructure of the federal republic and no public ’ firm.
The point of view urbanistique this relatively well being lured justify project.
You get a urban space that – if the ’ on, the charts planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of transportation railways s21 is counterproductive.
The bus terminal passage and the ’ enlargement of the section are designed to a traffic people they grant - and it is typical of the 1980 's - - a huge growth.
In the ’ time there ’ was not yet competition flights cheap.
The policy of ’ first modern trafficking should focus on strengthening the smuggling of goods, because the transport by rail is much more of the ’ environment that abiding by truck on the road.
But the new path, with its leanings, not need to trains of goods.
The s21, and it is far more serious concerns indirectly many ’ other projects railways.
For example, six billion ’ euros will be engloutis in the souabe project.
This ’ is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money is bound to ’ grossly and other points to engorgement in the network.
The list of the ministry of transportation mentioned in all sixty large projects.
The ’ one of the most important is the ’ enlargement of the german section through a valley of 180 good miles away.
Since 1987 this story is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgently needed here ’ rely on the fund fungi.
But the project s21 ’ effect of ’ is a sabot freinage.
The course of the rhine valley is becoming the international goulot stranglehold trafficking of goods, and this in the heart of europe ’.
The government examine the judgment made about the airport
In regional from wiesbaden parliament, the government of land has spoken of the possibility of administrative call the tribunal 's judgment of hesse concerning the prohibition of larceny air night.
The minister of the economy dieter posch (fdp) has announced that the cdu / fdp coalition had of legal experts to examine the point of view the judgment made by the tribunal bureaucratize and which is a document that includes more than 400 pages.

The coalition must have decided to january 4, if it wants to be a pourvoi in cassation against the judgment made.
The opposition criticism this deadline and trying to put pressure on the government representative to the cirenonce in pourvoi among the federal court administrative of leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group spd torsten schäfer - gümbel invite the cdu and the fdp to return to their promise before the election, and that was to ban the flights night. otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a speech.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to fulfill its word, said the head of the greens tarek al - wazir by the slogan éléctoral allusion fdp "we keep our promises."
The minister dieter posch disproves the blame schäfer - gümbel who claimed that the government of land tries to allow when even the flights of night included "of avocasserie and roublardises."
It takes time to make a specific legal scrutiny.
The coalition does not take decision on the basis of a "first impression rapid."
It that the decision must be legally reliable, said stefan müller (fdp).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the declarations on the prohibition of its fraction of night is completely érronée flights.

Accelerated election
Finally has when even past faster than expected.
A barely two weeks after the limogeage of the current taking the office of redacteur in - chief nikolaus brender by the boards of german chains zdf, the successor is already appointed.
The commission wanted to vote yesterday night to make the appointment.
Peter frey who directs the drafting berlinoise zdf was the favorite grand.
However, has not wanted to confirm the chains officially - - the vote in order not to resolve the procedure.
However, it appears that there has been also do no harm more 'willingness to the intendant of the zdf markus schächter in cases where the proposal would not be accepted by the board.
Frey, which is the candidate of schächter, had need the vote of 9 members of the commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known to the closure of drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, schächter had proposed to the board of prolong the five years nikolaus contract brender but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the council had declared favorable to clapping for brender and 7 others had voted against. the destitution by vote of brender was a unstuck although predictable for schächter.
Indeed, the cdu that is majority in the council of administration had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not want to renewed brender in office.
It is roland koch, the minister - president of the land of hesse who organized a league against the editor - in - chief.
He had refused than the very estimated redacteur - in - chief 's contract is sustained by invoking the fact that the rate of hearing emissions of the information zdf had fallen under brender.
This is why the protests had even place, virtually until the vote, lashing out at the political pressure on the zdf growing influence.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law that were immiscés in the debate and who believed that the way to act in koch was anticonstitutionnelle.
But this does not have the resources to.
Peter frey: who is?
Peter frey was born on august 1957 to bingen.
He studied the sciences - policies, the etles pedagogy languages romanes spanish ().
He then worked in südwestfunk (radio body of rhine - palatinat) and the frankfurter rundschau (daily german national) range.
In 1983 it becomes editor within the zdf first the magazine topical "heute - journal" (journal today 's).
Then its progress continues: from 1988 - 1990 's he was the deputy editor - in - chief of the time; and correspondent to washington in 1991 / 1992, then and until 1998 he was the and host head of the "morgenmagazins" (emissions of information bimensuelle presented the morning); in 2001 he was responsible for the service of the zdf and foreign policy chief of the drafting berlinoise.
After the disgrace of brender, so that it was just be elected journalist of the year by the journal specializing medium magazin, the greens have announced that they déposeraient a constitutional complaint
The adversary of koch in the council 's administration, the minister - president rhine - palatinat kurt beck, a declared last week, the länder should transform the treaty of the intergovernmental zdf so that the proposals of personnel of the intendant cannot be blocked by a majority slanted policy.
However, beck envisage not to ask the withdrawal of political personalities members of the zdf surveillance commissions.
Peter frey, successor probable brender had skillfully manœuvré among council 's administration in criticizing the commission with strongly in his decision to dismiss brender.
With this evidence of independence journalism, schächter was able to offer for the editor - in - chief without losing face, as the council of administration could elect without that on the soupconne put as a partisan politics.
In arithmetic depictions of the parties, frey is classified liberal left.
Grand cleansing in the education
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and business cultural länder decide to feel more conciliatory: at a meeting between the ministers and delegates to the recteurs conference, an agreement has been developed stipulating that working conditions of students bachelor or master should be improved.
In the future, the students should be able to come to power bout of their studies.
They are especially mis to accordpour alleviate the burden of examinations: a unique review must continue to close the modulates of study chosen.
Moreover, the charge of work will be reconsidée to ensure "proportions realistic and acceptable."
The authorities policies and firms to higher education want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
Moreover, the länder have committed to organize the more flexible common structural prescriptions for whom are pursuing of bachelor and master.
The regional level, he must not be regulation differently from a land to another.
Fewer examinations
Since the early last june, the student protests education minister of the länder and recteurs universities have repeatedly mouth the expression to the way: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, this seems to be a meaning practical expression.
The council of licensing decided to reduce the number of some examinations dramatically: "every modulates normally power should be concluded by a unique scrutiny," can be read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold grimm, president of the council of licensing declares that in reducing the charge of examinations sharply on should stop dérapages, that threatened to the étudiabilité substantially.
The "étudiabilité" should also be, to the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules as the fund must be evaluated carefully to see if you cannot avoid this sensation suffocation that sometimes on felt in the choice of prices.
Hamburg / berlin - according to the recent knowledge in raid on kunduz, the opposition estimates that the defense minister karl - theodor zu guttenberg (csu) is guilty of deception deliberate.
The students should "the possibility, and the room for maneuver needed to enable and allow personal initiative."
The new regulation address access to new cycles academics but will also be tailored to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" all five years, however, which means that it is that by 2015 that all cycles have been addressed.
There is a 10 of licensing competent agencies on the whole federal territory that depend on council licensing created by the länder.
In october, the education ministers had exercised a certain pressure on the länder agencies to weigh on the order that programs are not too charged and the regime examinations too strict.
In some specialized länder, the upper universities and schools have already heard with their ministries regional to take the appropriate steps.
The rhine - palatinat is so far, the only land to have agreed for allowing more means development of the bologne process.
With these funds, universities must be holding tutorielset programs strengthen the offices of orientation pedagogical as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations
The länder and universities forecast for this a budget of 10 million euros.
Early 2010, the government wants to remove the parliament a amendment to the rule of law on firms higher education.
Following this need more move only one to close its studies scrutiny.
The organization of more studies will be more flexible, it must guarantee recognition of notes met other institutions of higher education and access to master must be simplified.
By the end of the next year, the "étudiabilité" of all cycles academics will be examined.
Jeudi last, the government and opposition to new debated the question conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont been popular but critics have heard.
The federal president of the union of students socialists made clear that it would like the organization of the educational policy does more in the future "behind the doors closed" of ministers and recteurs universities.
In later after the educational strike, students as people affected should speak a little power.
The future diplomés of higher education on received support from the president of the conference of recteurs delegates (hrk) margret wintermantel: "the experience of the students we is very useful" a - - she says jeudi at a meeting with the ministers of education länder with whom the hrk working on a common project of reform.
For the union of education and sciences (gew) the decisions taken in bonn did not go far enough. it calls for the right and the possibility for every bachelor to put a cycle of graduate master.
Andreas keller member of the committee director gew demand by elsewhere that the länder ensure the students bachelor today 's, that there will tomorrow enough places for studies master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The länder must therefore hire more responsible for prices.
By contrast, the education ministers have not mentioned the possibility of alleviate the access to master.
More than ’ a note in lower - page on herta müller
It ’ is by these words "arrival in germany, and it ’ is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet werner söllner, in which he thématise in bribes phrases troubling, the experiences of ’ a dissident happened in germany that has gained freedom at the same time, but has lost its territory linguistic.
Werner söllner, born in 1951 to banat in romania, was first professor of ’ german and to ’ english bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a house ’ edition to youth before s ’ installing on the main in frankfurt.
Söllner received different prices literary; in 1993 he derived the flesh very convoitée poetry of the ’ university goethe frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of literature forum hesse in the house of artist mousonturm in frankfurt.
It has done much talk of him in circles not literary mardi last, in ’ a congress in munich, whose theme was the "german literature in romania in the mirror and the mirror distorting of your dossiers securitate."
Conspicuously destabilized and gêné, söllner fit a declaration in which he acknowledged before his colleagues german - writers romanians as richard wagner, william totok, franz hodjak, and helmuth frauendorfer that ’ he collaborated as a ’ informant for the securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the german language, together with some participants.
The test of ’ enrôlement opened insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes söllner ’ a "so someone who does not ’ has enough to resist auxessais ’ intimidation of the securitate."
The poet werner söllner is the informant walter (in walter).
Almost simultaneously with the ’ honoration nobel prize for herta müller and his literary copies brush with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the scene literary is especially troubled romania 's community of german authors originally, by a case that shows clearly the abîmes and bassesse ’ a political system, based on the surveillance and the police ’ intelligence.
Werner söllner is, as well as the ’ can be said of ’ after the current knowledge, not only guilty, but also victim.
In his own dossier securitate, in walter played a role, assures the specialist of literature michael markel after the confession of söllner positive and it goes back to the influence of in walter who intercédé in its favor.
"it was able to draw from all the difficult situation ’ era," of ’ after markel.
Markel a felt the need moralde do comment.
The form in which söllner fit his declaration and to the public was unexpected, however ’ admission of ’ a former dissident of its collaboration with the secret romanians ’ is in fact, not so surprising.
The ’ germany is a pleasant to spies of the securitate reserve had already wrote herta müller in july in the journal "die zeit," after reading 914 pages of its own file.
One can assume that the victims will speculation and have sometimes deviné which names last real hiding the names of loans sorin, voicu and also walter.
Instead of germany, where between time the consultation of the dossiers stasi process is a reliable, the attitude vis - à - vis the ’ legacy of the records of the securitate is still very confuse.
A systematic éclaircissement has been endlessly frustrated and thwarted in the years.
That ’ is that ’ in 1999 that a national council in line with the institution birthler was created to work to assimilation of the securitate (cnsas) but the archives restitution a rather dragged since records.
There are since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives.
That the ’ influence of ’ old members of the securitate in romania is still very large, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the securitate temesvar that, after the announcement of the award of the nobel prize to herta müller, exprima of way trés' s disregard for the lauréate.
It had a psychosis, and ultimately on will ’ had said that ’ only once.
The ’ dirt of power assumed power ’ express here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of ’ expression.
Of course, far inevitable postwar issues are associated with case söllner as it happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? that has been spolié listeners, weighted? the reaction to the ’ admission söllner, let hope that the result of this chapter will be defined by a braying for knowledge rather than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On genesis of the ’ of herta müller yesterday, which has received nobel, it ’ is more than ’ a note in lower - page.
Come to the champions league
On had the ’ impression that ’ a representative coming here, drawn four pin from all right to ’ a celebration of christmas sympa, on which the manufacturer of ’ articles of sport had spread its goods, when the new coach vfb christian gross monta to midnight less a quarter in a mercedes class that, he was right to call, a bag of supplier to the main orange plastic.
The man, whose crâne bats attracted the ’ attention, left lead in the city that it was still foreign.
Other our quinquagénaire could take himself the drive – it ’ had not bu of ’ alcohol, and it was not drunk of happiness.
He spent a pleasant night but tomorrow it had to return to work.
Because it is now that it would begin.
The words of ’ switzerland that the ’ we should commit three days earlier were clear: "we are well reached the eighth of", it ’ is to say in the final champions' league thanks to our 3: 1 against unirea urziceni romania, "but we must not be blinded by success. this would be a brutal struggle for not reverting."
The "great" we work attend sunday.
Here, he would ’ is repeating mainz the results of the daily champions' league.
And he must overcome weaknesses that have back after the three purposes expéditifs marica (5.), träsch (8.) and pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing the sort
The end of the eighth champions league (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 february / return match 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. march) will be drawn to sort the december 18. nyon.
The joy of the ’ came into office fulminante of successor to babbel was thus moderate.
Moderate and joy was not only among those who had been chance, who had transmitted to stuttgart destabilized professionals, an motivation no gaps and pleasure to play.
I was see the players and i told them that ’ they should focus on their assets, their i advised to ’ be more courageous, expliqua the "plombier souls" – gross - the recipe of success that - if bienmais was more of ’ effects with the soigneur babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed jens lehmann - partisan babbel - "in football when there is a new impulse happens sometimes things that we could never believed possible."
And sami khedira who, after weeks of pause for the rang injury, avança better thanks to its dynamism player, "" seen by a phenomenon tried to describe the proverbial "vent costs" and the method of work of the new chief: "it ’ is someone ’ a passing ’ action and demands of the discipline.
This is what we need ’ in the current situation. "
But apparently babbel had missed.
The vfb stuttgart has not yet past the cap, warned the manager horst heldt
For the moment, vfb stuttgart has mostly need of resilience.
Like gross, and the players guarded manager tightlipped overvalue victory against a defense utterly outdated and weakened of invited romanians.
They were also won in glasgow before ’ have four days later a bad awakening to leverkusen with the 0: 4, objecta khedira.
Horst heldt, the manager, signaled that ’ well they had reached a point of the season but that ’ they y en had to ’ others who were still far.
We don 't yet have passed the cap difficult.
That heldt the day of its 40th anniversary ’ has not to the core party, even after the first victory at home for three months, is of the events of week - end that ’ an interview guardian of 's televised but jens lehmann fit rebound just before the beginning of the game.
There are decisions than ’ others are not jens, undermined heldt, in response to the acerbe critic of lehmann.
He accused the direction of weakness and saying that ’ style it had decided to change of ’ coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann had tried also as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the games has been removed.
The declarations of lehmann were "marked by a pure egoism" ground heldt and announced the consequences for the guardian of but.
They are more likely to become friends on these two even life.
In any cast ’ agreement for everyone, they were remains, it is prior to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation game and assertive would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "for a large part in the" success rétorquèrent heldt and lehmann in chorus – and even the ’ man in sac plastic acquiesça.

Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller, which, before the duel, announced the end of the ’ era klitschko, managed to avoid the coups the champion, empéchant as well klitschko to enter into its against right dangeureuse game.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, a particularly tried to move the rounds.
Although ’ he continued to provoke klitschko in words and gestures its coups ’ reached that very rarely the champion.
It is when even the second boxeur after timo hoffman in the ’ 2000, a have bypassed with klitschko distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had done much noise in the capital switzerland before the combat.
It insulta klitschko the work of "vilain zombie" that "’ is not really able."

The case kunduz
Frontal attack of opposition: the head of the greens, jürgen trittin, a parliamentary group accused the defense minister guttenberg to lie in the case of the matter kunduz.
The spd and the left parties (die left) ask the chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / berlin - after review of recent information on the air attack kunduz, the opposition has blamed the minister of defense karl - theodor zu guttenberg (csu) of having délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister a intentionally "articulated a lethal contrevérité" on the plight of two trucks - tankers last september, the leader of the parliamentary group said the greens, jürgen trittin saturday, during the issuance of information of the chains ard "tagesschau" (the journal of 20h).
In clear, this means that it lied.
Order to kill has been given au contempt total of the rules of the international security assistance force (isaf) in afghanistan.
It is, in essence, the contents of the report that nato possesses and that has been lu by mr. guttenberg, trittin said.
Last friday, according to new revelations of media, the goal of lafrappe consisted in reality, not to destroy the trucks stolen, but was to eliminate two heads taliban important.
According to the report of nato investigation, 142 people were killed or injured during the american air attack, which had been launched at the request of the german colonel goerg klein, military commander of kunduz.
The greens, the spd and the left prié saturday chancellor angela merkel (cdu), to say in the federal more would time before the parliament and reveal what guttenberg knew really on the incident.
Jürgen trittin and his party 's colleague greens renate künast are ’ view that madame angela merkel should categorically if the massacre targeted strategy is part of the afghan government fédéralet if the chancellorship policy, the ’ military and intelligence have approved the new strategy.
The government 's spokesman rejects outright such criticism.
The chancellorship a in no facon influenced the army 's interventions in afghanistan, a t - he says.
On saturday, a strong voices have been increasingly to express doutesquant for reasons real the removal of the inspector wolfgang schneiderhan and general secretary of state peter wichert, such as this had been presented by the ministry.
According to the paper 's intelligence spiegel, the information that they had damaged guttenberg concerning the attack of trucks - were both tankers correct and comprehensive.
Officially, they would have stashed the existence of nato 's hidden and the minister some details troublesome.
In the inner circle of two senior officials on yet suggests that they have informed the ministry of defense of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages colonel klein and that a report by the military police.
The "frankfurter allgemeiner sonntagszeitung" reported that wichert would have entretemps called in a haul a clarification facts.
So far, there has not gained answer
On saturday, the ministry has not wanted to comment these charges and a return to the federal government 's parliament committee of inquiry that would be the following mercredi to dapporter light on the facts in question.
The world 's dream
Some see, all awake, images, and hear voices that nobody of ’ another sees neither ’ hears him.
It ’ is not only among patients psychiques, or the ’ effect of drugs, that the line between the ’ imagination and the reality is mixed up.
As long as these phenomena reflected during the sleep, will well.
When we lying in our houses clouded, can we pursue without impediments to and myths wildest dreams.
However, when awake, indeed ’ experience of ’ state of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, a fast western reputation in our world of ’ be crazy or junkies, or at least ’ be a original.
Such images and votes ’ are not only among the sick psychiques or under the effect of the drug trade.
It ’ is our imagination that is in cause: it is the same neuronale activity that enables us to devise homes, painting tables or write novels, but who incite sometimes the line between the dream, madness and reality to squeezed.
A state of awakening aware, taking the form of a dream, can be present in the forms the more diverse, in the best case on call this visions, at worst of the folly.
But even if the trigger and the ’ are distinct effect, the visions of drug mystical hildegard von bingen, the experiences of the prophet new age carlos castaneda, the latter states of the psychoses chamanes, and the hallucinations is attributable to the very similar process.
There is hallucinations or delusions when the ’ balance, the substance neurotransmettrices brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and the ’ achétylcholine - breaks and that the ’ interaction between different parts of the brain is disruptions.
Of hallucinations and complex thoughts délirantes reflected very often during a psychosis schizophrenic.
The strength of ’ soft landing n ’ a more power on the person.
Since the ’ antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always reviewed on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream - awake; wilhelm griesinger, one of the founding of psychiatry modern, constatait in 1861 "a great similarities between the folly, and the dream," to sigmund freud the dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and illusions sensorielles that compose."
We are in 2001 autumn when henning t turn into a gang of ’ person drawn.
His body colors criardes is two dimensions.
The ’ soft landing n ’ a more power on the raz him, he plane ceiling.
He felt a coup.
Behind creatures of evil ailées, grimaçantes, the mouths ensanglantée, showing the teeth.
They continue, give him of coups feet with heavy flamboyant boots, the cheerleaders against the walls of pain throughout the body, he felt.
Of tonitruantes, evil, howl, lifting of the walls and radio.
It can no longer the bear those votes that the ’ insult and the ’ humilient.
Henning t. his two câbles its chain stéréo, in fact a circle and the ’ attaches to a crochet fixed ceiling.
It amounts on a baffle and goes the loop around the necks.
He leaps.
The loop out.
Either serve a lesson, screaming that the voice in a chorus grab the tympan. "will be in a clinical and do - thee practitioner!"
Today ’ now henning t. a 40 years, he lived six psychoses acute, the last date of 2, the first soon 20 years.
It was triggered by the lsd.
The diagnostic: psychosis schizo - affective paranoid, moreover, it is maniaco - depressive drugs, it takes against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, it is married since three years.
During the psychosis i ’ have lived of fears terrible and désespoirs deeper.
The illusions are a brutal reality.
One for roughly -% of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics; it is the disease more frequent after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people involved can no longer make the difference between the world interior, and the outside world, they have coalesced into a state of ’ hyper excitement, who make that ’ of mégalomanie, they can suffer from ’ hallucinations of craziness relationnelle or persecution.
It is very current of ’ hearing voices – voice that commandent, which commentent or that dialoguent.
The hallucinations optic are not rare, either.
The person concerned can no longer the distinction between the ’ important and the ’ trivial, the brain can no longer the screening signals knows, the trouble is drowned under the sensations.
Just as the dream, the psychosis opens the écluses for a tide of ideas, and fantasies issue deeper couches consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis focuses on the subject, according to the thomas fuchs, professor of psychiatry department 's chief of chu heidelberg (allgemeine psychiatry in universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic lies in the center of the situation, to a meaning focused on him.
Meanwhile, he finds itself in a role liabilities, it is like a dream, overcome by the events of actively and cannot act on them.
This is why the schizophrenic ’ often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general ’ have not taken the possibility of ’ adjust reality, the illusions are a brutal reality, wake up is excluded.
The ’ do experience once in his life of ’ a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to fuchs sensory, "the structure and space of reality that is perceived during the psychosis, is fundamentally conserved."
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on the reality, the ’ alienation lived a place in a real framework.
Why our brains fact - it is this kind of cabrioles, always a puzzle for researchers.
The situations exceptional can get everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to have a genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, but of twins studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors decisively.
Researchers assumed that the people affected present of ’ tiny brain damage.
Suppose that the brain 's maturation neuronale is disruptions of an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains fuchs.
But what is still unexplained, it is the way the anomaly of neuronal happens and system of boot, the fact that it does not for many years.
The environmental factors play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is a susceptibility.
Similarly drugs hallucinogènes can trigger psychoses, because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brains chauffe.
What is crazy, we says professor of psychology erich kasten lübeck, it ’ is that the psychotiques suffer from their hallucinations and take drugs expensive to ’ in undo while of ’ other buy drugs strong expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a question of point of view.
Kasten together for ten years of the reports on the hallucinations and phenomena images illusory: the ’ an past he published its results in a book entitled "irréel in our heads the world."
The hallucinations do good part of phenomena concomitants typical psychoses, but also of ’ a much of ’ scores of other infectious diseases.
On account among them psychiques as the borderline unrest or depression, but also the morning, the ’ épilepsie, the sclerosis in sources, disease ’ alzheimer or the trauma crânien.
It is surprising is that in some conditions even people healthy brain is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to kasten, compose fragments of memories that normally are inhibés.
They take form when the brain areas who treat perceptions sensorielles, are hyperactives or not enough refrénées; when our brains chauffe, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger the state as injuries must brain or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, the stress, chagrins ’ love or other states mental exceptional.
In recent studies, one - third of participants recognizes have at least once in his life the ’ experience of ’ a hallucination.
In summer of 2005 sarah k. a 16 years, it resident a small town of previous mecklembourg - poméranie and it will in school.
A girl all to normal indeed.
If ’ there ’ there was not the images, and the vote.
During the would, it comes as ’ a boy, slight, long hair châtain, him to address the speech.
When it responds his pals the watch, dazzled – nobody of ’ another sees neither ’ hear this boy.
They believe that this timid is a girl rêveuse lunatique but sarah k dream not, it is certain.
It is éveillée, hear and sees the boy as it sees and hears the daughter who is to side of ’ it on the bench.
It may even perceive his presence momentarily.
It ’ is a sensation pleasant, it is this young sympathetic.
I crazy?, it sometimes wonders.
But it knows that the young and other visions are not new real and that ’ they will disappear.
The night appearances are, in general, scare.
Often visions are intrusive.
When it is in class, it arrive ’ it could not follow the price because professor is just by train to forge a new pupil in its eyes and ears, while ’ it is invisible for others, and that the professor is obviously in train to explain of equations picture.
The night appearances are, in general, scare.
When, in the ’ blackness of its house, it attend the sleep that arrive too rarely and far too late, it often cannot do the distinction if it is already éveillée or dream, if the images that ’ it sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with entailles sanguinolentes on arms and legs are closed to open its eyes or.
Let me quiet, shouts t - it to these creatures.
It ’ by not speak its parents or its friends, they take for a crazy.
Autumn 2009. sarah k. a ’ today, 20 years.
It has had its premium last year, and it must live with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since that internet ’ it entered into contact with the psychologist kasten it knows well that ’ it ’ is not crazy.
The folly is also a labor ’ art of hopelessness.
When someone ’ a is socially isolated or ’ stimulating has not enough, the likelihood is great that it has of hallucinations at the end of a certain times.
I suppose that the brain ’ are not enough occupied, done so that there is the animation.
Sarah k., daughter unique, was afraid of other children when it was small and played often alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, as the ’ man that ’ she called papa, since that ’ was in age of thinking, ’ was not his true father.
This is the same brain areas that are active for the hallucinations facial and acoustiques, and the real printing and bruits, so it is very difficult for the people as sarah k to make the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to kasten "a place in the brain, the reality is formed henceforth.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, this is why they seem if real. "
For kasten, the night dreams are also a form of ’ hallucination.
The sound hallucinations of people are distinct not fundamentally from those in psychoses acute.
A the inverse of schizophrenia sufferers, mental healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not images real.
This ’ is why kasten advises to its cherish the patients hallucinations as a particular talent.
There ’ is that ’ a not between the dream, and the ’ hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience on a unfortunately fast tend to take the experiments imaginary to pathologies, according to professor michael schmidt - degenhard, heidelberg and clinical doctor 's chief of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the ’ hospital florence nightingale to düsseldorf.
A serious psychosis is a disease, painful but also that contains something positive, de - creator the folly is a labor ’ art of hopelessness.
Schmidt - degenhard studied the form of a special ’ experience dubbed oniroïde, a form of the modification consciousness éveillée by the dream.
The semi - dreams occurred oniroïdes are very complex that are perceived as real by the lives and that it cannot differences in the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state ’ of conscience oniroïde manifests itself for a trauma or in extreme situations of pathologies as for patients polyradiculopathie that fully aware, are the ’ experience of ’ a engine paralysis.
According to schmidt - degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total incapacity and durable to move, this substitute real that undercuts its life, by his own imagined world that is dissociated from reality.
This ’ is a state of mental limit between the dream and the ’ hallucination.
As it ’ is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world a place, but the real situation is represented in the ’ imagination.
It is in fact, a intense resources and form of ’ interpretation, in a situation in supposedly intolerable, an ability to ’ organization that we is, to men, not to stumble into the rubble the loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The zurichois peter cornelius classen, the historian of art described as its oniroïdes experiments in his book "change of heart" as protecting the ’ soul action.
He 49 years, at a time when his understands part to a trip several days after the ’ operation ’ a valve heart followed by ’ a kidney transplant; his body, meanwhile, is doomed to stay immobile réanimation.
Claussen plunge in a world that ’ he created of all parts, visit places, foreign trip over time. he sees itself in the old man alité in a sanatorium, a robot railway to its those sure on health.
He saw in the middle age among lofty who make drug to base of blood.
He is seized by a greek to riding a motorcycle that the ’ emmène in his country, he surfe with his bed of hospital in the névé alpes and faces a mafia korean.
It is ’ absorbs completely in this imagined world, is real even later in its memories.
According to claussen these internal travel are distinct fundamentally of any dream.
The dream is a quite different state, he wrote in described what he lived.
On the contrary, the dreams memories from voyages detailed mental are of a extreme clarity and very even years later.
On may even say that they are much more distinct and intensive than the real lived.
The ’ intensity of this lived daily fact burst the ’ horizon of our other experiments, according to the psychiatrist schmidt - degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, the psychoses, hallucinations and experiences psychédéliques we show how fragile our representation of external reality internal are even in a state of eve.
Any change of the state of conscience, summed up the psychologist kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experiment that can also be quite enrichissante.
The first snows can down
Burda
A 27 years, the children will the aftermath of the house of éditions.
The appointment of kallen as ceo éditions burda is a solution: in the longer term, intermediary hubert burda wants his two children will return to the press, a group - - he says the journal spiegel.
The family holding must remain in a company 100%.
Hamburg - a long - term, the éditeur hubert burda sees its society in the hands of children
The two children inherit to 27 years and are determined to integrate firmly society, a dit hubert burda, 69 years, the spiegel.
All the details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be assets in the company to arise thereafter.
He also need to see if they are capable.
On may not impose his children to 7500 collaborators without whether they have the ability to occupy.
This démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda had done knowledge jeudi last that he retirait president of the post - director - general from the month january and that his successor was paul - bernhard kallen.
Kallen 52 years, is a member of the board since 1999.
He was first responsible technology sector.
Thereafter it occupa sector treasury it is to say that it was responsible for the capital of the firm and after the departure of jürgen todenhöfer he was also the head of the marketing abroad, the impression sector, and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family is at the head of éditions burda.
The children of burda have 19 and 17 years, respectively, his son felix who would today 42 years, died a few years ago.
The nommination kallen serves also to make the connection of the next 10 or 15 years "
Burda fact that the holding must remain 100% between the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in the families that have left allow by a much of capital, which have huge speculation ill in believing that they could rise always more high.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had a universal rêvede power, burda said.
I do not see absolutely me in the role of précepteur in countries like could be springer and i did not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time, these firms have taken too many importance.
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it ’ is ’ a facility that allows only to watch its mail, without offering the possibility would be - what that certain types of attachments or navigating internet.
He used his five minutes of glory in the united states, when the time magazine the désigna as the ’ one of the ’ year products.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the ’ idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, peek provides a price, and a principle monthly very low cost, or less than half of what, for example, the ’ principle data of the ’ iphone.
Given its success, the ’ company has launched two new arrangements: the ’ a designed exclusively for twitter, the ’ another with a free service of data for life, six times higher than the peek.
Fonpeek yesterday, presented in the ’ event the web, is the european version of the ’ invention and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited that us his great - brother, but has a surprise.
The price for its principle monthly, roughly 12 euros, including the roaming throughout europe ’.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the fact to forgo data when the ’ on through a border or to seek desperately cafétéria on the wifi (or a connection fon) to power consulted his haul.
The ’ idea ’ a roaming to a fixed price is incredibly appealing and this fact long that ’ it should work.
Indeed, some have operators ’ special agreements and ’ options trip, but in which me concerns, i ’ would need ’ have made a thesis physics to understand and good lunettes to read the small characters.
The memory ’ repeatedly order of the european commission to offer of roaming affordable prices throughout europe ’ had a barely perceptible effect.
To the ’ outside his country from ’ origin, on hesitates to use the data, and on a not wrong.
That ’ a small as the fonpeek (it is always curious apparatus that ’ he ’ calls fon while ’ it lacks wifi) offers this type of prices, means that investors are beginning to think differently and study different proposals of efficiently their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, he understands the download of books and ’ other research on the internet.
Without principle and soup.
He ’ is ’ a facility linked and the ’ on pays during his purchase and not every month.
And it ’ is what i ’ hope to see a day for the fonpeek: a option of ’ purchase with access to life as peek the propose already in the united states.
Not that i want the ’ buy.
I look my haul on my telephone, mercy.
I wishes, simply because i believe that it ’ fairer is a formula for the consumers.
This would be interesting to see a computer presenting even system.
The color preferred michelle
The yellow is preferred, without doubt, the color of the first lady of us.
If it is ’ is made to the inauguration of barack obama presidency of the united states with a robed and the manteau of this color, it has, indeed, chose the even for the ’ accompany in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: reset oslo the nobel peace prize.
Michelle obama was also a very similar model in these two occasions: their color ressemblante, a yellow firing towards the green with reflections bright, the two time, the held consisted of three shambles: the robed, jacket and the manteau, in the same, and was ornée ’ a great broderie tissues or ’ a collier.
So well that ’ a first coup d ’ eye, it appears that the first lady us follow the wake of the princess of asturies and has chosen to put the same fulfilled.
But the fabric which are very different carved the two baskets makes them.
If the inauguration it ’ was of ’ a dentelle épaisse in oslo, by contrast, it was a velvet printed.
The green accessories also are different: shoes to iran way for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but doré, this time.
The coiffure it, too, has changed: hair are now risen while ’ dropped them was the last time.
75% of mothers who work have eu problems professionals to cause of their motherhood
The discrimination to work has increased in recent years, especially for women among younger generations who want to be mothers.
This ’ fertility is what reveals the ’ study "and professional careers women in spain," the csic accomplished in collaboration with the ’ instituto of the mujer.
The ’ survey conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, is no room for doubt: 75% of mothers who work have seen their professional careers limited to cause of the childbearing.
The ’ study indicates that ’ there are many differences concerning the beginning of life in couple and the number of ’ children, whether or not the woman works and the type of ’ employment occupied.
Those who does not ’ have of ’ activity outside the home, work part - time or a stable, they are work little earlier in couple, their first pregnancy sooner and have more ’ children.
By contrast, women with a stable, mainly in the public sector job, postpone the ’ entered life in couple and the first pregnancy, and less ’ children.
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed have their first child labor, on average, 3.7 years after ’ settled in couple. this figure going to be 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women with a job stable eu need more time in their lives to get, which has brought to postpone the ’ union and the ’ arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of ’ employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less the beginning of life, "common date explains the chercheuse of csic margarita delgado.
The level of ’ studies is another factor that widens the gap in the ’ age of marriage of women and their first child.
Of ’ after the ’ investigation, more the level of training is high, they are marient and have their first child later.
The difference is also among women in ’ maintains an even generation.
For example, in the group that between 35 and 49 years, those who have been studies basic and superior have been mothers, respectively for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average.
"another disctinction also appears between the women, depending on their level of ’ studies.
While those who have taken elementary studies marient and have their first child before to find a stable, those job as studies of level or higher reversed this agenda and give priority to the ’ receiving ’ a work stable as a precondition for marriage and to the ’ arrival of particular ’ a child, "madame delgado.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who has roughly 70 years, is promenait in our neighborhood of the city of fuenlabrada, when ’ a group of young between 15 and 18 years rose to side of ’ she and our dog, a blood - mélé, saved de la spa and cumbersome not more than six kilograms, and without saying word, they assenèrent him two coups de feet who left the dog grièvement wounded.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what ’ ago to ’ amusing attacked a small animal without gratuitously defense that, in addition, was leaves.
It must add to this the indignation of a woman who are promenait quietly, and that, when that ’ it injuria these individuals, came to fear for its physical integrity, because ’ a énergumène that an animal is able to attack the same thing to a woman, a child, an old or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The ’ episode came to 17 hours, a mardi as another in a neighborhood typically quiet.
The dog has gémi any day.
We have of course the commission filed complaints neighborhoods, even if we doubt that this serve to grand - chose and affect the sensibilities, we are just not to say that the spanish cowards killers were.
The ’ indignation brought us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to ’ they find amusing to mistreat an animal without gratuitously that gives us defense of the ’ affection, the ’ friendship, and we is company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and fesvial, sets the port for helmet
The making of tires michelin, spanish in collaboration with the foundation for security (road fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of helmet, mainly among the motocyclistes younger, as the ’ indicated ’ today, the two structures.
This goal is to raise awareness of the initiative ’ importance of the port helmet, because ’ he s ’ is the only element of protection of ’ avoid the wounds to the leadership, or even death, in the case of ’ accident in two bands.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign to ’ roads inscrivait in the style its commitment to security, who "goes beyond the conception and safer" always products and manufacturing has said that ’ it helps this goal by ’ other actions pedagogical character and informatif.
This new campaign of ’ encouragement of port helmet in two bands, under the currency "to be or not to be," comportera a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motocyclettes, ’ in to ensure the broader diffusion.
Finally, michelin has emphasized that security "is a constant concern" road to the ’ business, because as manufacturer of pneumatiques for the two - way, the ’ a vehicle of its main goal is to develop products always safer.
The sale of vehicles slight increase trade
After almost two years, the market vehicles light trade begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles immatriculés in november spain represent a 12.6% relative to 2008 and increase, which is more important, they are the first increase consecutive after 22 months to cut, ’ after the numbers of the union market of anfac and manufacturers of ganvam, the dealerships.
But it should nuancer the good news, since the reference servant comparison, the month of november 2008, has been particularly bad, with a diminution of 60% relative to the ’ last year.
As a result, despite the rebondissement last month, the immatriculations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the ’ exercise precedent.
Since january, if the ’ on add together all vehicles that enter the category of trade light vehicles (derivatives cars tourism, pick - up, fourgonnettes light, fourgons light and trucks chambers) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect the much their demand have not to dissipate. indeed, although ’ they are also bought by individual, most purchases are achieved by small and medium sized enterprises, who pay in nearly 100% of through external financing.
Thus, in addition to restrictions involved in the limitation of credit, it must add to ’ other factors such as the ’ increase the rate of unemployment, or the persistence of the bad economic crisis.
Facing this situation and the difference vehicles tourism, aid to the ’ purchase of 2000e have little use.
In addition to the individual, independent and the small who wish to acquire a vehicle commercial lighter less than 3.5 tons with a level of ’ co2 emissions that does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of ’ operations speaks itself.
Yesterday, among ganvam, on recalled to new the need for the administration ’ ’ on a particular attention to these vehicles, and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The ’ dealerships association forecasts a year 2010 similar to those who have ’ ends, for which it found a collapse of sales (vehicles tourism and 4x4 19%).
The ’ freinage of ’ emergency assistance is now compulsory
As it has occurred with the antiblocage system of checks abs and as it will take place with the control of esp, the stability of ’ aid systems in freinage ’ emergency will be a compulsory element on european cars.
They are ’ elsewhere already mandatory light on cars tourism, and the trade vehicles newly immatriculés vehicles, while the rest of the a period of deficiency was set up ’ to end of february 2011.
The extent, imposed by the european union ’, a goal to strengthen the protection pedestrian, even if, by its mode of ’ action, it can also help avoid numerous shocks great.
The ’ assistant at freinage of ’ emergency is increasing pressure on the brakes in case of ’ emergency detected by the system by the coup pied given by the driver.
But this last keeps not always until ’ pressure to the end.
To ’ after a study by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch, one - third of drivers involved in a accident ’ had not been rely on the disincentive before the collision, and half of ’ between them ’ had not benefitted during his entire force.
Until ’ to 1 100 accidents
The ’ intervention of the ’ help, in revancha, requires the maximum the system of drag, reducing the distance whose car to need to ’ stop.
Of ’ after a study of the ’ eu, if all cars were equipped to this kind of ’ elements, until ’ to 1 100 accidents mortal in which pedestrian are involved could be avoided each year.
This would be even more important with popularizing reducing the so - called intelligent systems of freinage ’ emergency: on found that ’ a dark on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped ’ a system that, thanks to a radar or a caméra, détecte obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to ’ act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he ’ aid increasing pressure on the pédale, if it is necessary.
If ’ he reacts not, and while the collision is inevitable, the system is exerting the ’ maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General motors until ’ reporting in january the plan for opel
While the workers from the ’ opel factory to figueruelas (saragosse) have been warned by nick reilly, general motors (gm) europe 's new president, that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of ’ april – probably 8 –, ’ after javier ortega, the north american manufacturer warned that ’ it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan of ’ opel.
Nick reilly, gm europe 's new president, meant that every point of the plan was approved by the relevant section.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be ’ first submitted to workers, then the governments of countries where the factories, or are postponed until ’ to early 2010.
By contrast, among gm, on assure that ’ a decision on the sale of saab should be taken in the coming days.
There ’ is not surprising that the swedish government has tightened the us pressure on the manufacturer so that ’ at faster it takes a decision.
Gm be recognized in contact with possible new buyers.
The ’ a ’ them could be geely, which also aspire to buy volvo, but the dutch manufacturer of cars sport 's candidacy skyper, supported by the russian group converg, takes the ’ importance.
In the case where there ’ would ’ with no agreement to ’ them, gm can sell part of china saab to the ’ firm baic.
The decision to close saab at the end of the ’ year if it does ’ is not sold maintained.
In the driver of the porsche boxster spyder
To design their last and valuable bijou, engineers porsche are boxster parties and have succeeded in the ’ amincir of nothing less than 80 kilograms, what leaves the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This led to happen, in the first place, the roof automatic that has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel, technology to reduce 21 kilograms, to use the door in aluminum like those of the gt3 15 other kilograms, to take the climatiseur, 13 kilograms, to reduce the reservoir of ’ essence of won 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms, to rise in the bacquets sport, even 12 kilograms light, and with tires 19 pouces, five kilograms.
Finally, they have given au system audio cdr - 30, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by wrists tissue, save the remaining kilo.
Although the model is also with the box pdk to double embrayage, the test has been accomplished on a model for box manual of six speed, mainly on roads of secondary network of mountain, in california, with turns particularly tortuous.
Its behavior cannot be called than ’ unimpeachable.
The decline of ’ prevents not the car being attempt to ride weight on the ground with self - confidence.
On the contrary: it was long that we don ’ had not tested a model also small and slight, which at the same time, in the security guarantees all turns, including high - speed.
This ’ is a small, capable of ’ athlete échauffer its musclesà slow during the time, until ’ to what we asked him to sprinter, to curb, and push for new back its engine.
It is out what we wanted to. thanks to his direction, also communicative that precise, car will what ’ indiqueront our hands on the stealing.
And it will with a surgical precision.
His an engine of will
The son of its v6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 of more than the boxster) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the ’ option "sport," or through a system that upsetting the rugissement engine, already used on the panamera.
The ability to ’ acceleration is brutal, that it is in the ’ halt or in récupérations.
The hard or inconfortables disruptions are farms, but not.
The revêtement routes that we parcourues with the boyxster spyder was enough abîmé, but the car properly managed the goose beehive.
The electronic assistants barely act presence on the whole journey, while some turns we found in the verglas small morning and graviers, later in the matinée.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more divertissantes to conduct and that is far more than ’ a simple change in the boxster.
The car will be applied to the sale in february 2010, a price for 70 831 euros.

After days roses since the last spring, during which the ’ asset inflation has been the dominant note in markets, the ’ uncertainty is looming to new, which ’ is not surprising since ’ it is natural ’ acts of their state, in the circles in which agents make decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The cure employed by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt by the ’ direct of ’ asset purchases and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity to rates close to zero, so that financial institutions are buying assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of ’ assets were almost finalisés and, without in jeopardy their political not of liquidity -, beginning to put a bit of sand in the operation, as the ’ did the ecb, with their hurled at a year of the next week.
Thus, investors doubt the ability of the global economy ’ to maintain a without economic stimulus measures heterodox and we are in train ’ witness a inversely of reducing the risk premia.
Stock markets' volatility and corporate bonds departures increase again, although ’ they remain very remote paranormaux levels that ’ they have fallen at the beginning of the ’ year.

The ’ spain has been barely hit by this episode of ’ instability, but then standard & poor 's threatened ’ another revision to the decline in the kingdom' s qualification ’ spain.
Of ’ the other hand, a little ’ uncertainty ’ is not bad for do concealing defenders of moral hazard, who tried to new to unleash a case of conscience in lesresponsables global economic policy, which had thwarted the destructive derivatives effects of the limitation credit on the destruction of the ’ employment, whereas what ’ he could do it ’ is ordain a new day of ’ offensive action.
However, the situation of tribal dubai resembles a struggle between emirs to raise its place in power in the emirates, and we have already been the case of greece.
A government that conceals a public - finance deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot the roses.

It would be perfectly irrational that the ’ ecofin saves hungary ’ a not respect of its external payments at the beginning of the ’ year and will enable a member of the euro - zone countries in not fulfill its commitments.
By contrast, which is logical, it ’ is that the ’ ecofin has led the greek government transparency and accountability its citizens coresponsables extraordinary measures of the need to maintain stability of its public finances.
If, as we ’ hope, we face to find a episode of normalization of risk premiums transitory, after a few excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case spanish, as our departures of the public debt ’ adding to the extent of bonds ’ european firms, nousn ’ have not to worry.
