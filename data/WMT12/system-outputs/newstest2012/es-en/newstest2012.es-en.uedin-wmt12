The parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of section of the Criminal Code condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former Prime Minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantage for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet firm, the appeals court has an obligation to review in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political vendetta by the regime, and even in the West have raised doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code which sentenced the former prime minister was supported by 147 in the vote.
For approval is required 226 votes.
The victory Libya
The history of the Libyan release, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi from was buried in a secret location in the desert and without it there is no longer any war.
Is to define who is the winner
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but it is now a question of whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has come into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which in some ways.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves were cut off the hand.
Women are already may be forgetting to emancipate and apostates awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, made up of tribal war, will join in the Koran.
In Libya will be an order that we cannot even imagine, and we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit them, instead, Libyans already mentioned.
It is not surprising that the Islamic fighters accept grateful for the help of dogs infidels.
The only justification was that, in his view, the NATO attacks was not an American general, but large Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions.
When looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a firefight that serve the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not deal with Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises are not a problem to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation will manage the black gold oil made with the Libyan only with fine words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that the West can boast of protecting human rights.
Whenever the supporters of Sharia law we are not cross.

Daily menu of a child obese: Not desayuna and dinner sausage
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 years have weight problems, where overweight affects the 9 percent of the school population and obesity to 5 percent.
Obese children are mostly from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
It is to demonstrate the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, children obsesos feed, for example, of sausages at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, only 19 percent of the obese had cenado chips on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "The obesity is not a coincidence."
The families of children who are overweight, there is no tradition of sports, which applies to most families, where only 15 percent of the children said their parents, at least once a week, found time to exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "The obesity is not a coincidence," which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
Until now, have been involved in the project more than 12 million children from the 4th to 8th grade.
A proper diet and exercise in family are factors that make drastic cuts in the number of children who are overweight and obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded with five meals a day, according to the regime: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
But without breakfast for dinner with packing
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, are important, moreover, the details, which also include, for example, have a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren ate breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each desayuna alone.
But the worst was to discover that in the 10 percent of households are not desayuna nothing.
Breakfast is, however, is the basis of a daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children are much more often the unhealthy chips.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily soft drinks, sweets (70 percent).
As a general rule making sport more than 40 percent of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result was reduced to less than half, only 15 percent.
Diet Fabrícate your
The next phase of the study that the elected chavales 172 (204 boys and girls of 13 schools) are set up their own allowances from all possible bids, according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is particularly alarming the popularity of the soft drinks, sweets," is in the final report of the study.
As a main meal takes the biscuit pasta and continues to monitor poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject the pulse) and a taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Healthy habits change
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive information fair.
"In the control group of participants in the study, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention programme" The obesity is not a coincidence, "was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating," noted in the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, the soft drinks, sweets, where many children begin to prefer the normal water.
The children also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for food and would restrict the use of fresh food and flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, argue professionals
In the introductory article, how they learn the stylists, I complained a little of that initial lessons were already pretty loaded.
I had no idea how it would be.
Three conferences professional expertise, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment industry.
And it will be worse.
The closer they are final exams, more information and practical tasks lie ahead
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in no man) on how to dress for women who do not have a perfect symmetry.
And that is the vast majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized without the proper curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist has learned to relax optically a broad shoulders, extending a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, huge breasts and hips and waist close and at the same time not too challenging vestirla
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers are not appropriate, it is worth taking sewing at least an extra piece of cloth.
Certainly will not regret, because the clothes that feel perfectly is unaffordable.
With a skirt to measure will be much better than one that is constantly moving, get up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The body estilizado can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapeados.
There are certainly many types of information and a number of bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to bring order in my head all this information.
Even so, I am afraid that with the task assigned, I have more than enough.
Each participant in the way it has been allocated two famous, who will design two rooms: One for the day and night.
We must take into account the current issue, the fashion style that fits in with the person in question.
I was touched "dress" Miranda Kerr, perhaps the campaign speak of the Victoria's Secret.
Cry inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who recently have fattened around 100 kilograms (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.
The clothes have to be cut from magazines or on the Internet and imprimirlos them, and then drawing them graphically.
The moodboard, as is the result, he expressed our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, is not only physically, but also addresses, for example, in the pages of magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is already on Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three invited specialists cheered the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer and Jakub Polanka Ben Renč fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist saberle should take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same piece of clothing in various ways.
The variability is, in this case, essential.
Well, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) you can wear jeans and a T-shirt with classic, but also serves to clothe the naked body with tacón shoes and photographing him as if it were in fact a clothing.
Or just arremangarla and raise the neck to get a completely different picture.
"Jugad with this," we insisted.
What I appreciate is the following advice: "To start work, we need to speak first of all the rules."
"Then you can break them off," said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear why memorizamos all these formulas, which combines with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines are different results.
That without talking about the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve, which aims to photograph.
So, for a history of fashion with 10 pages, therefore, ten outfits), we must be prepared, ready for use, at least 15.
And in addition to the photos clothing works in combination with other clothes, all of which are different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not a great singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear trend to use the services of the stylists.
Until the celebrities also are useless (enough my skills, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when people ask us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a very different from his size (lower).
Then there is just guglear magazines and find out if the heart has already been written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist would not just be in fashion, but they must understand outfit.
During his work, especially to communicate with the people who dresses, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
Known to the people, not less, defends his views.
"When you hired a director to clasifiquéis costumes and completéis with nice clothes, you can't catch and throw everything and say: 'Oh la la what horror". "
"Encontrad at least a couple of things that you consider and recommend to someone they can get," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should be on the so-called "placovka", that is to say, the stock market.
This is set around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
Are items such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There are also (nylon thread that serves the stylist during the session of photos of products such as handbags or caps), the lure of clothing special caution ahead, if this were more (the cobbled together and other enganches are not allowed, it could damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.
Not to stand in the passive listening and put something in place, we have learned to take the often of shoes.
Even during the sessions of photos in the study, on a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more.
And we did not do more to take and take.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to harm them by accident.
So we had to be very good.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservations.
The truth is that I was not very well these skills.
This is only a small part of all those who have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have noticed that engage the styling at a professional level is not a bed of roses, but I am just like what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run it competes across America.
Book review
A trip, in principle, carefree, is complicated by a series of lapses unfit for a routine during the morning.
To some extent it managed to meet expectations, but it is nothing if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new provision, which was added to the title The Run, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised to provide oxygen to the former racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of the show, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action.
We are also curious to know how they would be inserted scenes, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his own.
As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results did not vary much of what we had hoped for.
There are races that can be acceptable, but the total lost points because of failures absurd, which are already appearing in the series for years.
In fact cannot be called mistakes, but rather the reluctance incomprehensible of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
Are you into a story, the protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; for them, he offers to take part in an illegal race across America.
You sentáis behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to be the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into 10 stages and then, in more than 50 races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
That way, you do not have anything like the feeling that the game will always the same.
Some of the areas are even pleasant, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary.
But the walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produced a very nice visual effect.
In addition, racing diversify from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you encontráis a sandstorm that reduced visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains, we must be careful lest you sepulte an avalanche.
According to this, each of the racing is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.
For a time, for bringing a number of rivals demanded (in a classic race), after buying time to give (mourning classic timed) and then I expected a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, which will only make things more difficult.
The new is the landscape outside the car.
When Jack interactive animations are, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you must help, provided by clicking the button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because it is not to be disturbed and, in the context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The model of driving is the traces of the previous episodes.
This means that today is no longer much, but it cannot be said that it is bad.
If a realistic simulation buscáis, because you can look elsewhere.
But in a race with some action designed it quite this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain period of time.
Unlike the right of the models of driving, because this is not the case with collisions.
Such games is not expected to recreated with deformities and collisions complicated, but in fact before a coup against any object, you cannot predict how they will react to your car, so that not everything is in order.
It is typical that, in a very tight forward or move the car with a normal traffic, has only light friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car just doing stunts got out of control.
Or even just totally destroyed.
Thanks to the system of reseteo, there are major problems, but it may be giving you a bad mood.
The reseteos are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or sales of the runway, the game you revert back to the last point of rescue on the runway.
However, in each race only five reseteos available.
If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the start.
So it is no more than a help in the event that something is not going well, but it is not very unreliable.
Sometimes, or the reseteo aid, only learned the stage with the aid of memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, is to enter a specific way; otherwise, it is impossible to take.
Other times you encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilian" always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes sooner or later.
This makes rabiar especially in situations when they see that two cars that are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent is without problems, but when you have arrived, you must be either stop.
It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the "surprise" always happens in front of your nose.
The opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game llegaréis to sites where, without taking into account the time, provided you can do the same opponent in the same place.
In addition to this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost.
When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of the cars coming up, so that you can be beaten to start the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that will disappoint you immediately.
And it is a pity, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happened or where.
And indeed it does, if the credit is the idea with 50 or exclusive leads the league in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because it is you have to change their car, although the vast majority of cases you just what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for highways and the exotic superdeportivos straight driving for a technical, for example, winding mountain roads.
It is also a main narrative thread of parallel challenges, that is to say, there are careers in specific locations to be known by the stories.
Conseguiréis medals not only here, but also points to experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the stories.
To reach the highest level, the driver he opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds to the profile.
At the same time, there are connected a role Autolog online, to compare your results with those of other players and other functions disponibiliza triennial-intake.
One of the most difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history.
With the car you have arrived to the subway tunnel (may), where you ponéis to run in the dark by the (pass).
The speedometers os marks between 150 and 200 km / h (passes), and all of a sudden, you get behind the convoy and the subway is ahead.
In drafting surely will have a discussion on this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors we really taken by a bunch of stupid.
The technical side of the game is not unusual, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases, pleasant, sometimes even soberbios.
Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments reduces the quality of image and, at times, in a serious way.
This applies especially to accidents where involved many participants, when the quality of continuous image is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but it may be assumed that no one would buy the stake only for his music.
The feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game to avoid mistakes absolutely stupid, we have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
Gives the impression that the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but then because the mistakes you will, in the eyes with the force of a spotlight of airport.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions."
"I expected to be montase an all-out war."
"The last five, six years before the situation has stabilised somewhat, calming and new players get used to their new roles," as the conference began with conviction at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How does not take seriously its slogan "clearly and openly about Europe," he said in the first part of the conference, when he described each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, that would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also weighed the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"First comes the criticism, that if it is dull, grey official, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left everyone confused because they assume their roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and that has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is out of the question: "Who is this? What number I can call it? '. So this is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union of states such as China and India.
No one wants to prevent us from the cheese Olomouc
Vicenová has also been on the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, settled the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative, which were heavily affected by the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has for the moment many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador, "a good fuss," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, what sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled its main slogans, which arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity."
"The truth is that I do not like the Ugly abreviaciones, extranjerismos or jargon that people do not understand."
"How can a citizen to understand that in Brussels are not invented really cucumbers round or curvos cucumbers, bananas of various sizes and that no one is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?".
It also aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We expected the Europe of the speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people felt more positive than negative aspects.
In addition, regretted the low turnout of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of encouragement, but also the little support for the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, underscored the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me when I go to a Polish and Hungarian and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman in my hand, I said: 'What, as you have been, the Visegrád?", and is not to make any grace. "
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, faces budgetary policy harsh new regulations for the Member States.
Is perceived as a very real concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro zone and countries outside the euro zone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"For the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those who are not to be left out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and strengthen the two-speed Europe," is expected Vicenová.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the whole of the EU must be discussed between the member states, not only among members of the euro zone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence
If you find a term to define precisely the strategy of IBM, the clearest would be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its founding.
The basis of this nature largoplacista was the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
As he coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to believe.
Its slogan "Think!" Became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future (giant was also the title of an internal newsletter that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted.
"For us, IBM is a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered during 100 years for that reason, because he stuck to its basic principles, but some fear the changes.
This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century, "he said during his anniversary, the current director of the Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as in the 1930s, took care of its employees as the operator in the Czech Republic (Baťa IBM employees were among the first American employees were paid holidays, sure, a sophisticated and elegant uniforms pay system that rewards the best inventors and sellers.
The same sophistication in the long term the keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (to be one of the first global companies in ending discrimination of any kind, could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which Palmisano will next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that allowed ideas, because the signature work almost half a million people.
Institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than technology company," said the economist, a professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology," said George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green - as it is affectionately known in the US because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.
It is perhaps the most versatile (develops technology company both equipment and software, Web hosting services and infrastructure in a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
Has the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among their inventions are the ATM, payment cards, the swaps, the bar codes and diskettes.
This year, IBM facturará 220 billion. This year has become the second technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the tastes of customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, genital / 2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
"If your business is based on progress, cannot emotionally anchor in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That is why, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and, if they do not work, the leaves).
And that is the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and falls exclusively with Windows.
The future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is devoted primarily to services, of which about a fifth of programs and one fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion purchase of technology in the future.
The investments have continued since 2008, when for the first time was the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts according to the premises of his former boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis of the 29 increased investment.
Until now, the company seems that IBM has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
IBM's currency is change everything, except its value.
It can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexible aguantará.
IBM history: From the cutters of cheese to space flight
The company, International Business Machines (IBM) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM adopted as early as 1924 - originally was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880's.
Owned inventions such as the famous "watch out," which allows us to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over its supervisory board.
Fichó Flint, the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to help with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the firm basis for corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until the year 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, cheese and meat cutters to tills.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the turnover doubled in 9 million and began a major expansion of the company on the continent.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly 40 years in the chair of the leader, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working in the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the staff and the IBM computers helped NASA to guide flights into space (Mercury, Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight to the moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System / 360.
The classics "pecés", which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which acquired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to offer a comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy has paid IBM these past three years is smarter Planet, that is to say, "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned areas and has improved the circumstances, for example, in terms of transport and the administration of cities.
In the trade sector, IBM was not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows retailers to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, which was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR operates in the strategic focus of outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Here, too, there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her husband infidel:
Let Iveta, quédate the donkey, who no longer want!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it is over.
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef woke up from his dream pink and return home.
But it is not going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer to Bartošové at home, he could not even imagine how to end their marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not been moved 30 days after Říčany and Pepe not left to the singer.
So publicly stated that he loved.
Over time, Darina resigned itself, apparently accepted the terms of her husband and even dismissed him forever.
To Rychytář does not care who goes to bed with his wife.
If one day Rychtář broke with Bartošová, his wife is not expected at home with open arms.
It is the biological father of my children, and if you want to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will. "
"But we would not like my dear old borrico that was wrong, but as a man I have some ties," said Rychtářová and added that had already been desenganchado of her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
To Josef so far does not care that the woman has closed the back door.
"I accept the decision of my wife."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change as possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I respect that."
"The company remains in force, make arrangements for home care the garden, the home, I make purchases."
"Darina and I talk to normal, the only thing is that we do not share beds, said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he did not object.
"We sleep together, and it does not interest me, or where it is going, or if you have a boyfriend.
I know that it is my fault, I enamoré of Iveta and I take full responsibility, "concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do you also relate to you?
If pedís men who are able to cite a few vices typical of women, in general, each of them appointed without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize the following lines, where women are cited certain defects that can make the blood boil men?
To go shopping
It accuses its average orange of dependence on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a week in trapito?
Would you like to buy often in sales?
Then in his case, it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that should appease his passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk by the clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and after all the probárselas probador (ideally in all different colours)?
But for most women go shopping is a hobby, so the men can be virtually in hell.
Just remember how many times he has told her that the wait in front of the door.
The dissatisfaction constant
"I'm not too fat?"
"Would need to lose weight at least five kilos - should begin to exercise?"
"You really happy?"
Does not sound these phrases?
Do it?
It is one of those women obsessed by their appearance.
It is not that you should be careful, but many people are allergic to listen to their partners complain all the time of their physical appearance.
The strong also agrees that the more increases the frequency of complaints, most embarrassing are women.
The order and the first
It is like a merry-go-round infinite.
Cleaning the windows, the vacuum cleaner, mopping the floor, remove dust, mopping the bath and all that at least twice a week.
It accuses the couple that he has stepped on the floor with a clean up dirty, their children that have marred a toilet and a shelf with newly cleared glass doors that cost clean?
If you suffer from this "diversion," proves to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that the order and cleanliness probably should not be be paramount in the family.
This harmless cleaning could threaten their relationships and family welfare.
Unpleasant comments to
"Underpants used are left with the dirty linen."
"You want to get it tomorrow these socks used"
"It is not damp rag on the ground!"
If these comments to a couple more times a day, to know that it will take it out of their boxes.
Of course. You don't want to say anything bad, just wants to ensure that everything is in order.
Perhaps, if the men knew this, women, for its part, would not make such comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women would also cover the gossip, but also the offences and conspiracy against anyone.
Women are concentrated in the relationship, so I like to talk together things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
To the best of each of us sometimes is aware of a small and harmless setup.
With hand on heart, that is almost all women.
On the other hand, there are women chismosas of those that are not controlled, and they love chismorrear often despise each and are dangerous to the surrounding them, especially in a working team.
Voráček Jágr and helped with attendances to defeat the Philadelphia
The striker hockey Jaromír Jágr participated in the meeting on Monday with two NHL attendance that brought victory over the Philadelphia 5: 3 on the field of Carolina and once again to the Czech players in the forefront of the competition.

By Giroux.
After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase for the fourth of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."

"I never would have happened at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I am very happy about this."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and it now produces results, "adds Jágr.
Carolina even turned the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, penalty, to get a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, but eventually outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our area."

"Both rotate players turned against us, we could not resist."
"We had to make the game more, making the disk of our area."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defences, P. K. Subban.
The doorman Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 speeches by Winnipeg in the victory of 5: 2 on the Tampa Bay.
The goals of the Jets were marked by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that lasted five parties.
How prices have evolved since 1989 travel
Czechoslovakia in 1989 had until then only five state travel agencies 91,458: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies of the time sold in most cases travel only to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very limited.
Czech tourists were, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime was tilted towards the west and travel to the Czech tourists were then quite limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. the Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually or even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland and the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those days will also travel to the West, but one should be put to the tail with a sleeping bag and spend it all night, or "good friends" in the agency.
Yet not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, is not attached to the "people politically unreliable," that they could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency and, with no guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the West) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, which had a large number of huts and houses of summer, the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The way to travel to the Czech Republic has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.
While until 1989 for us was not going over the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs were 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
NNA great paradox is that now we are not aware of the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s was imposed visa exemption to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which resulted in a huge wave of short stays, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for a long time, they were tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a time.
For example, in Paris slept the Czechs in parks in tents, as our income, then we were not allowed to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was the carry (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy Western currency freely.
Our standard of living, and he also increased average wages, what about 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began in 1997 with regularity, to prepare travel using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly low prices for travel in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90 of the last century, as the Czechs travel visa-free to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which simplified further our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism pos-revolucionario happened in 2000, when he was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, assume direct charter flights every year with Czech tourists for distant countries and hot. This winter it will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The visit exotic countries currently nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year.
Another interesting time of this era, which symbolizes our development pos-revolucionario, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, with what our country has to be among the world's most developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in its history, has spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on travel abroad more than 15 billion Czech crowns per head, including spending on the farm.
General Assembly meeting convened to elect the president, which could end in stalemate.
For nearly five months, the Czech football is not president, and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR), is not known or after the convening of the next General Assembly meeting this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, will not be able to vote even to choose among the three candidates.
Stakeholders to preside over the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June, but not before calling on their colleagues to find a strong person who knew deal with the football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a candidate.
This was highlighted on 16 September when he had to be elected the new president.
Delegates to the General Assembly met in vain in the Casa Nacional (Národní dům), located in the suburb of praguense Smíchov, because the talks were blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.
No consensus was reached or as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives and delegates with full powers.
From that moment, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, endorsed the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, under which the representation for full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could not throw or the Executive Committee that, in their meetings, Ordinarias or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the focal point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which, in the direction of the association, which represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate with the greatest percentage of support in the federation which will present his candidacy.
The region of Moravia is willing to compromise in order to win the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations percentage should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"It would, however, the sense of the two previous rounds and negate the entire concept of a bicameral system," as well as Svoboda understands the concerns of the morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, is also agree Tomaš Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates should be more Pelta.
"I would like to vote as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"Not to invent any nonsense about representatives at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and that his comments directed mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new president, and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively.
"All the passions are apaciguarán with the party today of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be a player, and cooperate more at ease," said the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the more reticent.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not about the conflict between bohemios and Moravians, but there are attempts to tighten the rules for their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
There is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be made in Montenegro, but who can know until we start the party if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other Rajchl Kucera and Dalibor vice presidents, has not been this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to the executive committee at the place where the party will take place classification.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which reported to be held this Wednesday.
To Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to bring the parties divided the country's most powerful sports organization to come to an agreement.
The stakes are high: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of Sazka lotteries.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because it is a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a suitable candidate to pay all their ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or run as a candidate for a post as relevant.
"If the right person, I would be fighting for it, and I would not be a candidate in the elections."
"But so far has not been able to find such a person," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Soccer Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if they win, would remain in the office of the president only until 2013, when will the turn of the general assembly.
In that post he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too concerned with the football events.
"I have already spoken to some people who could take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment even want to identify with the Czech football."
"I would like to change that vision," he adds.
What aggravates Paclík at this point is Pelta's relationship with the president of the Football Association of Regional Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a past controversial, known as a powerful outside the little world as with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the chair.
"If he wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change."
"With the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious, football will draw even less," said Paclík.
Also mentioned the fact that a few years ago on behalf of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what football prestige could bring Pelta's victory."
"We will look into the eyes and with UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, which also takes caution his earlier statement that "Pelta Pilsen if the club would become president."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík cooperation with Pelta could arise in the future.
It is the opinion of another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed."
"It is very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."
"But not as a manager of a partnership."
"I do not go the nose where I am not capable," added Paclík, which in September drew a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Commission of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, replaced later by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it would manage the partnership.
Uses its management of private companies, since the summer is also the director of Pilsen, whose support held in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in football and contribute to their practice safe."
"To reduce the influence of certain lobbies, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathy towards the president of Daniel Křetínský Sparta.
One of the priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee FAČR and, with the help of which pressure on political leaders to put more money into the sport of taxes in the lottery.
"It is one of the key problems that should be devoted to the new president."
"If you increase taxes on gambling, as it announced the political parties would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going," says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take account of their association with the club Pilsner, although he says that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan."
Pelta is associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"But I do not see any sense to give my actions hypocritically Club of Pilsen to another person and then return there after a year and a half," said Paclík.
FAČR Pelta promised a new constitution that would end up with the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR had a new constitution that would definitely to settle future disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections in September, Pelta focus promised, if elected, particularly in the representation and raise funds.
At the last minute decided to participate in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months I could go either to defend and, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.
"People of all levels of football is a long time ago and expected this Thursday, the new president."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership," the man who is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as we thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.
"If I am elected president, I take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, is not to tamper with their opponents.
As in the past, had warned that it was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would be their first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.
"For more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"That is why many of them have doubts about its true nature," he said to his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the competitions.
The latter should be a showcase of promotion of football.
"Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose as a result of the bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."
"Immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," said two months ago to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years.
Then also promised that his appointment as chairman of the football staff did not lead to any change of the workforce.
"Would have to know the work of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable anxiety.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday at Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, no doubt we shall overcome.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if finally has a leader", two days before the most crucial time in his career of representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start to work with.
If the fourth General Assembly elected the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association, many people would probably resentful.
Rajchl promised that, if elected, he would work hard.
Wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee will be responsible for each area of football.
Also undertakes to solve the case of the bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money for football and continue the work begun by the former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football."
"Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the selection, professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance."
"This is not to say that it would all alone," he said in an interview for the Rajchl ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area."
"And asignaré difficult tasks that football can, in each of these segments, to go ahead with a lot of momentum."
"This is probably not many people will be happy, because it will begin to work very hard and not just to criticize the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, is said to have considered the possibility of not to stand again as a candidate.
"You know, that work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this makes sense and that there will be people behind me and I will not hamper at every turn," explained the reasons for his indecision.
"A lot of people told me that I should not give up, because then it would give up the other."
"It is to have faith in order not to leave as well, without more," he said.
According to say, it is also to continue the work already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, we have a lot of the work that I do not want to lose."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and I would like someone to stop," announced concerned by the fact that, if elected to another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could be as it was before the era of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is especially all the people who would be in charge of football to be only a privilege for a select few."
"I cannot be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I would like to make a football for everyone, because only then will be well all and not just those elected," said Rajchl.
Also rejects the idea that only serious bohemio the president.
"Although some people are trying to pretend otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact the split second division in the Czech Republic and other morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for the Moravians young players," said Rajchl.
Although the struggle of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I still have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which I chose as his deputy, and we know that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include savings of tens of millions of kroner disadvantageous contracts, the television contract talks and negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, acknowledges his part of the blame for the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to restore confidence in the Czech football," said the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that did a great job in the Pilsen that year."
"If elected, is likely to continue what we started Ivan Hašek and exchange not significantly the number of staff in the committees."
"I do not want to use that to my advantage," assesses Rajchl to their rivals.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
The blue leap
Julia Stanek for
Incredible at swimming pools, sumptuous bathrooms in Budapest: Who visit Europe can live their dream, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their legs tired in bathrooms bubbly.
A book shows where is the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder made a fact-finding trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be lacking in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.
Lying down back on the water, looked the artistic leadership at the top, swam to the marble angelotes, waiting at the edge of the pool with the swimming pool and deck asombraba modernist meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, noted in his book, when all the interesting details about the style and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book "Badefreuden ': Swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest," concrete buildings "in Taunus.
Made his "journey for the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom.
Wants nothing to do with sport, said Meder, only water is different.
He was just upset that fans will have to settle for the blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful trinos of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the head of Vienna.
"I began collecting fine swimming pools."
The surface of the water twice the architecture.
The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna. The factor of well-being in the swimming pool is so great because it met all the senses, Meder said.
And if the builder strives, indoor swimming pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms are an area of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the building."
All bends optically: High vaults, the tiles of colors, the launch pads.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides very interesting data in 190 pages on the history of art and architecture in the historic oasis of prosperity, but, above all, one might be tempted to jump to the blue.
Meder, the collector of swimming pools found copies in its investigations in Hungary.
Along with the excellent use as the bloodbath Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique kárstica cavity (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some termas, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are in a building with a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria have seen dramatic: While the whole city is the eyes in the swimming pool techada of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outside of a swimming pool in St. Anton, and, in the Turkish bath is a window from which can be seen in the ski tracks.
The design, perhaps most remarkable expected to customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral is a water Ötztal ovni just land in the Alps.
Steam rises from three sources open in winter, while in the mountains of Ötztal up in the sky.
In the Black Forest Alhambra
To Meder, the collector of swimming pools, he invaded the smell of chlorine in swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague of diesel is so strong that people believed to have come to a bathroom.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and álcali loam and sticks to the skin into the swimming pool, a welfare benefits in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in their pursuit of beautiful places to the bathroom, discovered when it wanted to go swimming, sunbathing and swimming in the Czech Luhatschowitz, encountered a blocked field.
The bathroom in 1902 the architect Jurkovic Duan was closed.
When Meder peeked through the windows of the modernist building desmoronadas red, yellow and white, saw the bushes grow between the tiles.
The decline counterbalance in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The Termal in Bad Wildbald Palace.
The bathrooms have three phases of construction behind; not only can you find elements neorománicos during its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall style Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its thorough modernisation in 1995, the Termal bathing is the favorite of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is a native of the Black Forest.
"All credit to merge different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic," said Meder.
In a palace immersion in the swimming pool and spa apparently does not have great importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank looks at the business of raw materials
For Christian Teevs
How Renuncia Deutsche Bank to his business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to monitor the impact of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the public, the matter is clear, according to a survey, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks from speculating in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents claimed that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it adds to the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity price increases, and banks are saddled with the responsibility of the problem of world hunger.
Consumer advocate's campaign is aimed in particular at Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar manner.
Originally, the betting on raw materials are thought to protect traders price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and make a profit of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to the criticism in a different way than the American competitors: Promised to review the claims and said that no business "is compromising the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to Spiegel ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims the report of Foodwatch.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the directive of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to repair its image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector, "betting on rising food prices are particularly drastic how ruthless banks harm the public welfare."
Ackermann is as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank should cancel all of its investments in the portfolio that could jeopardize the money for gambling on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter if Ackermann is the subject of people suffering from hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank wrote that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different to what is planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.
And needs only interested potential losses, this will be his successor.
Two thirds would override the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch struggles to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey by the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investment play in food prices.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business, according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel out all the investment of the money goes to land speculation.
The 43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, cancel your account and change to another institution.
The house in Vienna 21
The flag moved
For Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now reopened as the home of exhibitions.
The modern postgerra passionate about architecture, clear, the halls of glass, the bold curves and new construction materials, typical of thought on technical progress, for which the architect Karl Schwanzer Austrian flag of the 1958 Brussels and provides a good example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
The well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition.
With his legendary four cylinders to MBW tower over the adjacent building aplanado in Munich, became internationally known.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was called the "house 20."
The building was adequate but lacked the proper technology and space for a museum; no wall to hang art, not a good atmosphere.
Despite that was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and lapses increasingly.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now called "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, opened the museum belvedere, who owns the house, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, was a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, doctorate in history of art with a considerable career, among other things, artistic patinadora on ice in his youth, later at Sotheby, the founder and director of the Guggenheim museum of modern art museum in Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
With the exception of contemporary art, are the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba name of the foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookstore and built an office building.
Strict control, budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because reformed so sensitive the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contract, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a "huge and important place," which was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for use with generosity and easily.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "a devorador of energy," said Krischanitz.
It changed the profile of the windows of the facade of glass, a glass reinforced with fiberglass insulation and remplazó the glass ceiling for a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and reinforced steel beams or remplazaron and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light falling between the house and the street lighting, a bridge to enter the building almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in shades old mahogany and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control of the office of monuments and a low budget.
"Often had to find material that was good, cheap and also would like to the office for the protection of monuments," says Krischanitz and warned of a harsh in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building is flexible and slight.
The flag "who came to Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "appearance by chance in the history of the city."
An architecture that is "always in the wrong place," and that is why I wanted to "raise awareness appropriate."
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of luck. The entirely new and planned "district of the central police station," with homes and offices, along with the Schweizer Garten.
And it may be another stroke of luck: The house 21 could receive a strengthening of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art hall Berlin and, as you hear, is negotiating with the city on a neighbor in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a plan of crisis, which would prevent the breakdown of the trains in winter.
To double the number of staff.
What cost millions.
In the fight against the train breakdowns and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent this year, more than 70 million euros, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper Bild "reported, citing an internal crisis plan the group planned investments until 2005, out of a total of about 300 million euros.
So what should be better availability of vehicles and the rail network even at a time.
Among other things, it plans to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The aim is to clean up the snow and ice platforms for the operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for the operation at the end of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays on trains during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, lacked reservations about adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have for years waiting for permission from the federal government.
Moreover, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to see the lines of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a broken in the central police station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank paid millions of dollars in fines in the US.
After the tumult of the chairman Josef Ackerman, there is a new problem in the US, Deutsche Bank must pay a fine millions.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US is the giant in the sector, the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal to end the disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
Is the sale of mortgage securities.
The regulation of financial markets NCUA criticized many large banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and lead to banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties have to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, held the courtesy of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and support in the event of bankruptcy to protect investments of customers.
The NCUA tries to reintegrate the losses of millions caused.
The agreements are currently closed its first type.
The regulator had also asked for other large banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the dubious mortgage securities, are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results were a few years ago, the wind is blowing hard for US banks.
Investors have brought countless and inspection processes to receive compensation or punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has been the largest number of demands.
Accuses the 18 major international banks that the two US government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand of the FHFA, this is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection demands that the Institute of Frankfurt respond "substantial losses," without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as baseless and explained that he wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes to 10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invested heavily in the company of IBM Information Technologies.
Since March has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always found not invest in companies of computers and information technology as the forecasts of the long-term development of the enterprises are negative.
But he has read the report from IBM and changed his view on investing in the sector.
Should understand long before IBM offers on all computer systems and services for the Department of Information Technologies of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffett is regarded as an honour.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett unveiled today in the CNBC economy that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM failed so far none of the compromise.
He praised the direction that took care of the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have done a brilliant job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM established for some time, the Information Technology Services lucrative as the operation of calculation.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers advice as well as powerful software and equipment to businesses.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said that only invested in companies whose business understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity in a freight train, a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly roughly 80 subsidiaries own, as well as part of a series of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81 years, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and wise investments, the expanded into one of the world's most valuable companies.
However, their way of life is humble.
It is an idol for many investors around the world.
His fast and foolproof way to earn money has given him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha."
After discovering the investment of Buffett, the shares of IBM stock market rose one percent.
"The giant blue ', as it is known to IBM, has a stock market value of more than 220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, does not want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell," the Turkish media have doubts about the rule of law.
A newspaper spoke of a "bloody ideology" that is to be revived.
The killings of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin reacted with fear and concern about this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost who were believed dead for some time, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with far-right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned in Germany is xenophobia.
The far-right discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not far from predictable.
"Again to reignite the bloody ideology?", called the Turkish newspaper's online edition "Haberturk."
The newspaper Sabah "stresses that, on the contrary, one of the authors of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the pantanal far-right.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German politicians and Turkish reflected in a solemn ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German Turk.
Life was on the scene with gaudy colours, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap in the face, "the German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article in the Turkish platform of the Internet, "Haber X," referring to the background of the string of murders.
The German broadcasting "Hürriyet" nor insists chart this connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He said that those killed were people who pay their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and its subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors have been amazed that the German authorities have not sought long before suspects in the circle of the far right.
One is the less drastic rhetoric in the media: "From now on we lost, immigrants have no more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's domestic peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network.", writes "Selen."
Which means that, if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger of attacks and Solingen Mölln will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been etched in the memories of German and Turkish.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat, and the Germans, who mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks underscore the sense of group of the Turkish side.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was criticized then mainly the weakness of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit survivors of Mölln.
Following the attack with a fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, its foreign minister, replacing him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech which contribute taxes the Turks in Germany.
It is unclear how it is estimated the value of a person according to the amount of taxes.
The Turkish media present information to show how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of an explanation and a revaluation of the terrorism of the extreme right in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of the scandal of Lake Zurich
The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis, and since then has slipped through from one crisis to the next.
Now runs a German.
Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.
After his dramatic departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July that he would begin in 2013 in a new and almost equally spectacular job: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is pleased publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for his new-found strength and slipped kind remarks about his future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am pleased to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered since then also touched on, and all asked: When is Axel Weber?
It was also learned that Weber will advise the bank since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
It is hard to Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and director and has had a period of adjustment is necessary.
Coup is responsible for the strategy of the bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title "scandal, the biggest bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, was until recently the largest global asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, slipped to a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, it saves the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages money for wealthy clients more than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of the big banks in the world.
This impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "To my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one question: How could it be wrong?"
Was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, general manager, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, resigned unexpectedly.
A few months later, it was suspected.
The fund's investment bank embarked on losses in high-risk securities and had to write off billions.
To cope with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this found investors, of course, some look with contempt until shortly before: A state fund Asia and opaque of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that she had never heard his name.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative board, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, continued the disaster, in view of their wrong investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought distressed at the multibillion-dollar UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which became co-owners of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, said that this was the dramatic for a small country, if accommodated such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We cannot go back to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was ready to hand over data of wealthy clients, which may have disappointed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, approved a $780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted profits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With that, the UBS admitted more or less have helped in tax fraud.
At the same time lost something that was always their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The aura of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the president of the administrative council.
And the exodus of funds from customers.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two key areas: In investment banking by erroneous speculation and the administration of goods through the help of fiscal fraud.
And just when he came to be a little more relaxed, just when it was thought that the UBS returned to achieve this, this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realised that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.
"With the case Adoboli states that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that dominates the risk controls."
It was the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers who turned up for a long time, be the guardians of the world's greatest assets: No too great a risk to the safety of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
Security deposits in Swiss banks were the symbol of reliability unwavering, such as Lindt chocolate Sprüngli and genuine.
The core of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the buzz of the strong Swiss private bank, is only a little higher.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow covered summits in the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here are shops like Tiffany's between business and the traditional Swiss Sprüngli confectionery.
Here are the Swiss banks for years: From the national bank, through the palace of Credit Suisse, until the private banks as Julius Bär elitarios.
In the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Within the walls are lined with marble, here are large leather armchairs, along with the bank's logo is a great sign to indicate the "safety".
The UBS knows what the customer wants here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have pushed the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as is the president of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, as all Swiss bankers, also with the business of the two big banks.
The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
That the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And have been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the investment bank UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon, delivered his first major profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the great Swiss bank.
The 15 October 2008, the disaster was clear.
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" (" The crash of the UBS "in Spanish).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billions of euros to save the big bank bankruptcy.
How it happens?
Talks with Swiss bankers, see the problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge in a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it was that the two banks, but the precursors of UBS, a bank rich but asleep in the heart of the administration of goods in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.
Suddenly, the investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great bike.
There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that Dvurechye re-scramble from learning in the bank until the summit."
Finally, Ospel Wuffli trusted what they told them.
And in the end, Wuffli was probably a fatal error: "Thought that their models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The attempt came before the event.
UBS employees clearly remember leadership meetings, Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Down to the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank investment bank was the most powerful in the world.
Leading the "League Tables," rankings then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps he went well.
In currency trading and trading in shares was higher.
However, the business advisers responsible highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest in the language of banks' fixed income, "there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.
To fill the gaps, the UBS began an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Eager for growth, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investment.
Was transformed into a powerful machine to securitize mortgages and sell them to American, maintaining certain risks to themselves.
And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave because the attempt to order was more complicated than expected.
The posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and unsafe to the present.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a nearly impossible.
Must find a strategy for a bank, in which all the logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, focus on the administration of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go so far (yet).
But the investment bank should reduce much, it is clear today.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy in the world.
In fact, it was only in the italiano-suizo 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank, the bank left surprisingly Grübel of his predecessor.
In the meantime, he imposed: Should lead permanently business of UBS, reported the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its rule in the 1990s.
Deletes 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is?
What it wants to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe.
So far only said that first will seek a house with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Smart grajos spreading in cities
In many places the grajos are considered "birds problematic ": These are not expelled inteligentísimos animals in cities for a long time, say experts.
About love, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from neighbors in the dirt and noise of the animals.
Although there has been no way against the "birds problematic" until now.
The grajos no longer out of the cities, say experts in the first symposium on grajos in Read, East Friesland.
The specialists from around the country to discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attributed the problems of migration from the countryside to the cities of certain grajos protected; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly with the traditional habitat.
Hunting, the growing construction and falling trees that the hospedan made life difficult for birds.
The grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as Read.
In 2005, came to the negative headlines in the press a controversial project to kill grajos en masse to the district.
Critics have described the hunting of the animals through traps for birds and murder with sticks as especially brutal.
"Throwing and ahuyentándolos normally do not get anything," said Werner Klöver, urbanista and landscape gardener to Read.
Fire with water to the nests or throw the trees are often unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, an expert on environment of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Stray animals, the large colonies of divide and distributed in other places."
Ahuyentarlos is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, no longer the atrapamos."
Without the surroundings, will not solve the problem in cities, said Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Read.
It is possible to a combination of driving away the animals in residential areas and sensitive baits to return to settle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and against etnóloga advertised in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a peak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens cofounded in Schleswig-Holstein circuit on the education of grajos Ascheberger, where signs report on the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.
Jürgens also has its own opinion on the criticism by the sound of birds: "All forms of communication, have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grajos not only use the resources to access bocados shale, if not manufacturing tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etólogos of Cambridge University found in four grajos far does the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly to drop a stone on a platform in order to achieve a moth larva of.
Without much training, admitted to determine the size and shape that should have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the shrewd grajos needed to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva of a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.

A personal level massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, the beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the type that can make the heart drops.
Here are some tips for action: Start mildly this page and make it a its brand pages.
Will come to know very well to these people in the storytelling novelística of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae will act as a GPS, a beacon for those few moments when, as one of his men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What has written here is an unusual book, which rightly describes as "a work of anti-historia."
There are some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there is virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, "a book about how it happened." Is about "feelings, thoughts, experiences and humor."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experience in times of war more or less 20 men and women Ordinarias, on both sides of the war, and a botanical colegialas escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose its members, will be mad or die.
Their lives here as parpadean votivas candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others apagan.
The book by Mr Englund is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: The Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book will fall on the hives; one is the Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a book moving, almost from the start.
The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordita.
When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is at home with your children, there or huyes?
Anyway, who is?
Almost no one understands what is happening, or even for what it takes to fight this war.
"Lack of facts," said Mr Englund, "has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor fleet on the high seas.
Their stories have been made mostly of memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and make do with what we have.
Tell the story of German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes, substitutes for all parties."
"Ersatz coffee, aluminium false, rubber and paper masks, wooden buttons."
Still talking about the food substitute in Germany.
Described as "meat made from rice cooked in fat and pressing carnero (and topped off with a false bone made of wood); tobacco parings of roots and dried potatoes; shoes with soles of wood."
There are, he noted, "837 permitted substitutes in the production of meat sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about the honor and courage.
An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and is about the war, "You feel that, after all, this is what the men are designed not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that this means veneer and that there is no civilization behind this barbaric and tachonada pechera almidonada."
A British soldier realizes that probably will die, and that no one will notice or will.
"Once you resign themselves to the thought of, one would like to think that could happen in front of the public," he writes.
On the other hand, is horribly similar "to a convicted being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he called "a new breed of young bestiario in the century: The mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes and clothing that executes its carnage is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who attempted to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service in the front.
"The most grotesque of this can be seen up trade gonocócico, soldiers and buy embadurnan with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate and looking forward to their eyes, which often leads to a blind for life."
In this translation of Swedish made by Peter Grave, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task.
In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to "exceptionally uncontrollable forces unleashed: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are doing to combat.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without novelty in the face of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive histories.
The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon unconventional.
His book is one of the most devastating late that I can remember in a work of fiction.
I will not.
But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.
After a false step, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
They chose the night of Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was held in secret, except for a few senior officers, saying initially that others were joining a year.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underlined how the operation had infested of challenges to the police department.
They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the espray pepper spray on the protesters, in violation of the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas."
And that is why the police operation to clear the protesters Zuccotti Park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers were prepared to watch as they had developed occupations in other cities.
A greater disaster drill was taking place at Randalls Island, with one eye looking to Zuccotti.
The officers increased training of disorder - counter-terrorism measures that involve moving quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, in the side of the East River in Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park came at the last minute, "said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as" an exercise. "
"The few polis I know that were called for this, they said it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, officers wanted to clear the park, but had discontinued when hundreds of demonstrators came out ahead of time after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces throughout the borough - dozens of mobile operators commonly used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr Kelly said that many people, including those who travel daily to work, had been bounced back and forth in the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when it was the lowest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks of the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages from the loudspeakers that retumbaban seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs officers were at the park with its clear blue wind breaker, many protesters simply picked up his things and left.
There was no shop until 1: 45 a.m., said police, giving time for the protesters to gather their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety.
But many journalists said they tried to avoid that see the police action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by agents.
Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the dense thicket of personal effects of the demonstrators, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic full of clothes, teams from the Department of Clean-up followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were washed out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A core group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp was candaron between them for the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly.
The emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3: 30 a.m., said Mr Kelly.
The operation was complete cleared of about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbing the public order and resisting authority," he said.
The senior officer at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, "was not conducting operations," said Mr Browne.
A second group of players expected along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to go.
There were barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Since those positions, was to the police to expand the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
There were some 28 people in the north.
Some of the most vocal of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking away the air of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd.
In the end, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The workers' union will require support from the city by layoffs
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
Demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon available to the union, the borough 37, in its effort to repeal the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy and two aides of the school, the coordinators of parents and others who were among the worst paid in the city lost its work on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political vendetta by his refusal to allow the spring, access on the part of the city to a health care fund by working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have strongly denied the accusation.
At a hearing in the city last month, the director of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school support staff would be laid off.
Officials of the borough 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that would be sued. They held a press conference on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers made redundant as plaintiffs, all of them black or Hispanic women, like the majority of people who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, who had been subsidized chronically underfunded.
It said that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a wealthy suburb of parents to raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. The budget District 36 fell 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrollment by poor in schools.
The union also claims that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes the act of moving to a master of the payroll of a school in a bag, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators of parents were laid off," says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion was successful, the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by the chairman John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding Libyans for his successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honour the brave of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties fought among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and that never came to be voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of purgatory of legislation - with Congress sufficiently disturbing to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually take the rug out from under their feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "pays tribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "states the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measure Ganará has the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as the bill in June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.
A spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all the congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject to a vote of the full assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have not succeeded so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte's is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially Republicans job seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can meet, while the representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of New York), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111º Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and made 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when members were regularly more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But did not have much more success then than they are now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords said in his first interview since the shooting on TV
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range at a constituent event in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, sang to the tune of Broadway, "The sun will come out tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20 / 20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought for prayers and needed help to walk.
The programme documented his difficult path back to the damage caused by a bullet that he fractured his skull and broke through the left side of his brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he was taken aback by the House to cast their ballots, triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, rio and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41 years, he replied: "Quite well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program "20 / 20" an hour in length, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, it is seen in his hospital bed, his head shaved beards and a long scar across his face.
It can only have one or two fingers erguidos, while her husband encouraged.
Months later, sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to make simple actions.
A movement.
Fruncimiento of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "tostada," a request for a change in its breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Sees the congressman singing along with the therapists songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, that two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was leyéndole to Giffords a newspaper article about the killing of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who were killed in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being forcibly medication while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," he said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, it has not been defeated,'" said Kelly.
"Only has been hit.
And you are going to get out of this, and you go to recuperarte and you are going to come back stronger than ever. "
The troops felt more pity that respect
The event was a display of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about the helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their positions around him.
The crowd of label and applauded.
"The men and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized fund-raising of spring.
A senior military officer in the show, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"The show as a kind of orphan boy," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
That they had.
But it was not respect, really. It was unfortunate.
The conflicting views starkly illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorador.
Troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say members of the service.
The public increasingly acts as if given pity those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon will leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is set to us in the role of souls helpless."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that anger faced by troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks on the pity is carried out in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned to fight with the Marine Corps, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives.
Some mirarían them with a sense of fear that clashed with insurgents and traveled to exotic locations.
Others wonder whether there would be a "veteran not-completely-free and violent beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some members had asked politely if it would be able to stand up under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.
"When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative impressions," recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children.
The concern arises, in part, of the American indifference towards the wars.
The gains on the battlefield are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, we no longer military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
In contrast, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women have a case against the army for its alleged failure to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are planned for the next.
The first soldier Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy night in which she said that she was raped by a colleague.
It was October 2008, and was on his way back to their barracks in the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who was carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room to take a drink.
"Sounded an alarm," said Lyman.
However, the native Texas set aside their concerns.
I thought, no, has 19.
"It is in Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes into the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, tirándola down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they filed against the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation of the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., initially implied demand to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assault.
Burke said that goes to the top brass of the army, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her about 400 survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, is going to present a number of cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy, in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
In a ruling by the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the personnel on active service.
"The alleged damage are part of the military service of the plaintiffs," according to the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially banned from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars are rarely clear the front lines.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially for local women in war zones.
The result: Between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time that the army is also modernized, says Burke.
She is not alone in its fight, and three other demands are in place, as well as his.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic for is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a complaint against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them the high of service -- a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discrimination in the way it handles complaints of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report, published in March, also examines the indices: In 2010, a 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described the attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he said, he was asked to disclose the details of its violation 11 times different from a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker - a cut in its brazo- was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as a character witness in the name of the suspect, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when was read out the verdict," said Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work, I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I told my commanding officer," This is not a trial. This was my opinion. "
Lyman was ordered to pay a visit to a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for service.
In January 2010 was dispensed menos-que-honorables under terms of service, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he said, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence of responsibility.
He added: "The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things only change when the good people is ready to fight.
If the hearing is not on the road, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will be in line with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We are going to continue to fight against the army in this issue until the reform will take place," he says.
"Or until we muramos, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being alone in cyberspace: Had spent most of the time that preceded the attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you have to go on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on the populism of the European digital DEMOS British think tank.
The cache of personal information on Facebook is so enciclopédico, said Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years.
The team found half a million Bartlett fan of the right-wing groups across Europe and then I went announcements, but instead of a new band or vincularles product of diet, advertisements inviting users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to look at more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It is a whole new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of the right-wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of turning point, "those who combine his activism in line with the offline activism is more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and scientists, politicians are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the "likes" messages and updates on the walls.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova data" Facebook is fueling a boom in research, pushing the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title until nearly 800 percent in the past five years.
To some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to look at the people that you could not acercarte with a file on the street.
"Before, when intentabas survey of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You go through the party, and they would never get access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all this - you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the problems of salud-social.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues, found that college students who spoke of their feats of binge drinking on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with the drink that students who remained silent on the issue.
Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as residential advisers could monitor the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of state with their drinking.
"You can't deal with a problem if you can diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, a co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Conduct and Child Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "tapped" to his own people to obtain data.
The Team of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of turnout in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information accessible - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should be available to other large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow the site undermine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey that do not even know?
While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data offline and online is a free lunch for all.
"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that an investigator could be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study carried out with the walls of public Facebook students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between themselves and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a subject of this investigation being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information to a user's profile and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," said Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a sujetapapeles and a pen remain the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and talk to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik made his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Caballeros Templarios of Norway," he said to a room filled with 500 people.
"I am opposed to the court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views."
For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, go to the families of their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to keep a tight rein on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is kept under lock and key.
All were with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought that seemed cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya enough to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when it entered and left the building.
Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of "resistance", the judge ruled that it is not a mental illness, and said that there is no evidence that acted as accomplices.
It is possible that some are some comfort that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group.
But that does not automatically qualifies the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I would like to see it a monster, but it seems to be," said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seems."
7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, are in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.
But what the fan of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered anew that has been dusted and advancement of a series of special screenings in the largest markets this week, is how much this meant creative minds about business processes and work flows of products.
It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also a meticulous and an organizer of the flow diagrams yonki - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, barely 10 years had passed since that Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and we worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview was used in Cringely nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a full copy on VHS in the garage of the director.
This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, 68 minutes, at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies.
And very very surprised.
In four different points along the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is weighing clearly their thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times when the perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient because of questions of Cringely, empujándole to move faster towards the issues and arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what is that other companies are right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the race of Jobs, but there is something in the Jobs crude and inspiring to see here, the dreamer eager to the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after this all out here, and it did.
A quick summary of seven major sequences of The Lost interview:
On how he learned to lead a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always wondered:" Why do you do things? "And you cannot get the answers that are invariably:" Oh, that is just the way it is. "
No one knows why he does what he does, in business, no one thinks things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify accounting for Apple.
Taken aback by the way - costs were often starting with a "cost" standard that was as a rule of thumb, and then followed with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that claimed that could determine the retail business costs.
On the joke the Pope:
Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people hackear effectively the telephone company and to make free long-distance calls.
Much has been written about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT & T, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and a minute later the public phone next door," says Jobs with a risita.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."
The two of us, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant - was a lesson is incredible, and I do not believe that Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs is describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was excited to go to answer the phone.
On fall in love with technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, to the hunt for spare parts to build a meter often sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and I made a call.
Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a great influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what it was and how well a company trying to their employees."
Jobs later became one of the employees of HP who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen catódico tube, and I enamoré of him.
Would a trip to HP as a teenager and lose time with this machine and would write programs for it.
To improvise innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the way.
Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of plates, a customer asked him if he could get the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while he was at Apple, recalls the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse.
"I remember having arguments dramatic... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.
90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing strength:
Long before that lead to the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way in which many industry leaders tropezarían in his vision, and would lose control of its market share.
"I gave that trabajas in IBM and Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly of the market share, as the company has no more success.
The increase in sales and marketing departments, which are the kind of people who end up leading companies and products are removed from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to the monopoly position it rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the skills necessary.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have hijacked the entire computer industry.
Could have been 10 times its size, it could have been the Microsoft in the 1990s.
Took the defeat of the victory.
The innovation and artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it develops the big idea, changing and growing."
Learn a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you can't do that make electrons, glass makes them, the robots, the factories.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fit all the time...
In the end it all comes down to taste -- exponerte was reduced to try to better than a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things that you're doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What was in large part the Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which coincidentally was the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for the computer, could be doing wonderful things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas cenan with opponents of the health care law while the court accepted the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether they would accept the challenge to the law of President Obama's health care, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will set out the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered in a preliminary hearing to consider carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a petition filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit trámite demand and, in fact, is expected to be a historic plea for five and a half hours in March, and the result probably will further muddy the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law must be scrapped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among those attending were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party more important in the Senate and an opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If it were, it could be said that fall under the Code of Canon 4C, which says: "A judge can attend events to raise funds for organizations and other related to the law, but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of this event."
However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges in the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause (Causa Común).
"The judges were agasajados at a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
His appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for fairness, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that too easily mixed with the court's work agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas and his wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the Justice Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when it filed the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pushed for Kagan refrain from watching the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will do.
Boeing receives a record of 18 billion dollars
The airline Emirates double corridor for 50 Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounted to a record of $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, a gold mine in aircraft orders for future growth.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its biggest-ever asked for commercial aircraft in dollar terms - 50 Boing 777 jets double corridor.
The successful asked wine in Dubái Emirates airline.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total sale price of $26 billion, Boeing announced in the Air Dubái in 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly a huge positive impact for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these clients in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are the property of their oil producing nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to the airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies leadership of Boeing in the market for wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory in the event of air comes four months after Airbus said that it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
The shares of Boeing Co. rose 1.5 percent to $67,94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of violence during the elections of Michoacan state, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of his opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state of Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, it is alarming, not only for Miachoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... It took to the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has hope of winning the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have overtaken by little room to Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a conservative candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unhappy before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, Michoacan and he chose to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence has persisted.
The mayor of the NAP was killed a week before the election while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although the PRI, unpalatable to the elections in Michoacan, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I believe that this victory should be very encouraging for the next year."
The ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China] watching the difficulties of Europe in a "fair" and said that the Asian financial assistance with the leadership and European resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We are all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, that is by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for the major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian minister of commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the wealthy Europeans when faced with their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the University of Brown in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point you will realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why Indian reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss-making as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant knock-on effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faces the "downside risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows of their economies.
The Pentagon warnings about possible cuts in defence
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the 450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but now he fears a further reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would lead to a 23 percent of global reductions and a great many new projects.
"A cut of this size, this applied indiscriminately, would make most of our naval and construction projects could not be carried out - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other efforts to modernize," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and due to the reduction would be so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to give civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who are seriously harm our army and the readiness."
The cuts would be to the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While funding for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," Panetta said.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war."
"The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to vendors in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the main military power in the world."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening, when published the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a result that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."
If the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the possible cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon budget with years of experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that faced difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without bullets."
"It is an air wing without sufficient pilots trained."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that is suffering from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with the potential adversaries."
"In fact, invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provides new details of how the reductions "generate significant operational risks: Delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limited our ability to be deployed and committed throughout the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the warplane F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicles for the Army and the Navy need replacing, the humvee.
Stop the development and testing of the F35 could generate an additional $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
As a lie
A look at the most recent headlines indicates how serious and pervasive are the deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading accusations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accused the other of lying.
The trustees of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of perjury for allegedly concealing reports saying that a retired football coach was sexually abusing children.
Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone saying the US president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.
The congressman from New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials quickly rebatidos by the irrefutable proof.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of wrongdoing in the financing of the campaign in connection with the cover-up of an extra-marital affair.
And, again, no one who lived will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton during his second term by lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
On the legends are widespread cheating on tests of school and university.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers from the tests to students in order to be best seen in their assessments of performance.
Mentors who should be taught otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception we?
On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That sure, many of these lies are white lies.
Another study showed that the unknown cheating three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we need to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, Charada, where the aim is to say: 'You have, "the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos.
The liars do look in the eyes.
Do not always tartamudean, balbucean, ruborizan or uneasy.
We cannot conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A polygraph can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the declaration, the expressions microfaciales, training and the times.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and growing body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help to navigate the complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
The good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and felt intuitively how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extrovertidos lie more introverted, that men are more "lies aimed at themselves," while women say more lies "aimed at the other" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners to people who are not married, but the lies that often say they tend to be "huge ").
We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, look at the usual behaviour of the subject.
This is called "to create a baseline."
To provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.
Look at the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone usually golpetea with the foot all the time not to make accusations unfair when I see the golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then, look for groups of deceptive behavior, verbal and non-verbal.
Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, they can move their feet to the door, lean toward an exit, changing its position significantly or wear a "comfort postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the hard questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely imply that the interview was over, only to find that relief postentrevista.
It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the past tense as he claimed that his wife killed was alive, launching a search for it at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a language distanciador: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Anyone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when a difficult question to answer: "Well... to tell the truth... so what I was... in my view."
This means that the answer is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the Sebei-Lanzhou diverted after the threat of delay in approval.
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the adoption of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions, while apaciguaba to environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says he is prepared to redirect the project to return to steer it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that move the pipeline planned outside the area of ecologically sensitive Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol in Nebraska.
The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company remains confident that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project to explore new routes to avoid the areas of potential of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supplies.
"This is a real way forward," said the representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is beyond any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed its full support.
The pipeline, 1,700 kilometres would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
Take 700,000 barrels per day in the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but beloved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project was only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the inspector general of the department has ordered an independent review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because he was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child vomitara of fear
A family of New York says that the music diva disk, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a mad in the lobby of the building in Manhattan, aterrando his daughter to the point where vomitó of fear.
The tirade of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, which suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders," and "increased its fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the 10th of November last year when the scene-shifter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what you are doing your daughter?' I said 'yes' and I went to take it," he said.
Labelle admonished angry the pregnant woman.
In an aggressive tone, "said," We should have left her daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told him, 'I have no interest in what you say or think."
The angry and began to use bad words - the word C and J aloud...
He had a bottle of water and began to throw the water bottle on me. "
Said that Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to her, 'Look what I have done to my daughter," said the girl's mother.
Labelle rushed towards the mother -- who still rioters to Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by their environment and retreat to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk.
The small was crying so strong that vomitó, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but there was no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle not returned calls for comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money we get to an association of support for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make to Patti LaBelle responsible for their conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially when it leads to a kindergarten teacher who has a child in her arms to 18 months of age."
The economy slowed down climate adversity
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, foreign investment and the economy contracted
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, which fuelled expectations with regard to developments in the economy, but given the adversity climate for the beginning of the year, there was no sign of growth, but there has been a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of dollars in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic collapse of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of damage by frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, had damage to 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the total 78.03 percent suffered damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the victims were the main crops of vegetables, corn and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year saw a rapid growth, while from January to March, 55, 000 053 sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter, the rate rose to 5.28 percent, and the average between July and September have continued to climb to 6.19 percent, a rate that number of people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifaceted, the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the School of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, in terms of the actions that have been made public policy.
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was passed in the Congress to combat money laundering, $grab for the people who illegally it is not easy to get to work, and used to invest in something," he said.
Migration arrested
Lopez Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment, there is also a factor.
"The number of people who are going to the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because moving also have great difficulty in finding work, that people are falling and is demanding jobs here in the state, which means that unemployment rises," he said.
Informal sector
The analysis of the labour market sinaloense is compounded when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the working population in the state work without being paid as an employee with no social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's working behind the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of workers sinaloenses was, until September, 5 352 billion pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 375 billion pesos.
Of FDI contraction
In addition to the economic downturn and the rise in unemployment, for 2011 is the largest decline in foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance from January to June, the state added 630 FDI 697 billion dollars, representing a fall of 87.74% compared to the $312 $143 million recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounted for a total investment of $17 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the service sector.
The debt
Before the stage of economic contraction, the government of the state requested state congress in July to the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a total of 2, 000 600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions,
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdés gives shows a lack of capacity of government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Industry, said that in 2011, there was a lack of harmonisation of wills of the various sectors, including the government of the state.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground we lost this year, in 2012, we must redouble our efforts, failed to bring the effort of all, and especially the synchronized already this new team of government, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slow
Loredo Lopez said that events such as frost of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
"The low flow is the product of several events, including the frost, one of the main impact has been a slow economy that is not turning fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that will have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations that we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the employers' confederation of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that it requires the state to prosecute productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general, we have seen that there has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the role of the state and the economic course, because it is important to detone the full potential of the human and material resource of Sinaloa," he said.
To work by
The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future to better track the efforts of the government.
"In general, I would say that the government has been struggling to give good results in various areas, in terms of economic development, there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way to drive public policy.
"There are elements that may say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done, and I believe that the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
The condemned by 8 kgs of marijuana
To five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was sentenced a neighbour of Navolato in possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the narcomenudista sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of health, in the form of possession of marijuana for the purpose of trade.

Must contributions to works
The works included in social programs such as Habitat, Public Spaces and Rescue of 3 x 1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or have serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The director of Municipal Social Development said that although so far have advanced programs, are at risk of failing to comply with the state government contributions that you are a resource which earn more than $11 billion pesos in the three programs.
He noted that in total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the state has 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources to work, so that the delay in the completion of these is in force.
"They are almost 12 million which is up to them to introduce and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end and we have not been given a fifth, when since July had to give us a hand," he said, "we have begun to delay construction and are well advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions for them, so that at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million at the time did not provide the state administration.
"We spent in the previous six-year period because the government did not have the economic capacity to participate and programmes walked, and this year we have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover outstanding which left the state," he elaborated.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment to the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, said that the request was made by Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, efforts to hasten that rates will fall to them as soon as possible.
"They are almost 12 million which is up to them to introduce and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end and we have not been given a fifth."
Court validates "analogue switch-off" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital to analog signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional challenges filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree of the so-called "analogue switch-off" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, found that President Felipe Calderon is not overstepped its authority by issuing the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate, was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree inconstitucionalidad or, and this is in force.
The ruling, issued by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of reserve and hierarchical subordination of law.
Voted in favour of the draft only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional challenges to challenge the decree, and to accept the demands, the minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition.
The ministers decided to dismiss the case brought by the House of Representatives, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general measures to prepare the public service.
"Nor do I believe that if it did it would affect the independence of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector for the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate, rector of the state.
The replacement of digital to analog signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digital technology, which involves a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "which covers economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, including a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the executive power of the state."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has completed the digital transition, and it has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
We cannot conclude that the Executive, in issuing the decree challenged, that will in any way the powers of Congress, it is providing administrative area in the enforcement of laws issued by the legislature, he assured.

The same 9 November, the Supreme Court ruled the (SCJN) constitutional dispute brought by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" state attorney's vote on constitutional reforms, which does not have the right to "punish them or veto them."
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of the IEM will be the total and partial tallies of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial recount of votes, one or more packages, will be in the alleged that: The results of the records do not tally; there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the box or not to act on the president's power; or, if there are obvious errors or disruption of the proceedings.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the boxes of the election will take place when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election, which has won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than a percentage point; as long as the beginning of the session is the express request of the representative of the party or coalition that put up the second of the candidates identified.
The total number of the vote will take place if at the end of the regular computer stipulates that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner in second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, if and when there is a specific request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, the event in which exclude electoral packages that have been the subject of partial recount.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to count the difference between the first and second place is only with 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 minutes total.

Will be on Wednesday, the new Italian government
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The appointed prime minister of Italy, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the post.
Monti said that the president will present the results of their talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now painted," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy out of this state of emergency.
The chances of success of Monti were driven substantially by the support of the ruling LDP of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because, until now, many of its members were opposed to the government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any block or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks are added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as women's and youth organizations.
Will put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has made a transition extremely quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now turned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians only give it time to implement the reforms before early elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be formed only by technicians, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources said that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The pulse of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos (Costa Ricans) are
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called reached 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, comparing the 22 called for both countries to the friendly today, at 3: 05 p. m., at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world champions and Europe, number one in the FIFA monthly ranquin, reported a strong record of class A interselecciones games, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has 50 international matches.
The figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League in England, have a year of intense lobbying in domestic cup and league championships, and clashes in European Cup and Champions League.
To this he added the experience with the Spanish Furia eliminatorias complicated in the Euro and the World Cup.
Footballers Ticos (Costa Ricans) are, by contrast, have a limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see the full record of the Spanish Selection is arquero Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday before England (fall ‎ 0-1 in London) matched the exportero Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and imposed a new record of 127 internacionalidades for Spain.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's brain driving, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians in the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the battering ram of Schalke, Raul Gonzalez, with 102.
Of the nearly century-old figure is Carles-Alfred Puyol, with 97 games.
I still Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andres Iniesta, 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
The rich, and about Michael Umaña, are the left side Monaco Diaz, with 48 presence and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
The national side, with fewer than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel El Centro with 25 and Roy Myrie 23.
The rest is not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Nelson Vargas and Edder Ólman debutan yet.
The scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the most experienced with nine points, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in his tour of two decades of history
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the downward Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that they, too, will make the dream of playing in the country.
He assured the downward and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be their only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7: 30 p. m., along with the band angelina The X and nationals of The Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
To his supporters in Costa Rica, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fan?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us as well.
This is only the second time in South and Central America, and so far has been great.
I have been in Costa Rica only once and holidays; it is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we are excited carry our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fan living with intensity the days before.
What do you say to their most ardent supporters?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.
Some people even refers to his concert as the largest show of the year.
It adds that a little bit of pressure on his visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.
A couple of shows that giant in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have made way for this concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How was it discovered Costa Rica and its waves to surfear?
We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves that are unbelievable.
My friends were always surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, through people who loves surfing.
To see the tour, have been delivering shows huge with many songs.
What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched it before, then we do not have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fan a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think that is in part because we have nine discs and can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertory that we are just not to touch, that keeps us focused and we also has surprised because it reminds us why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe that it is more interesting for people.
With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of history.
Looking back, it is hard to believe everything they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us can imagine that we would be in a great rock band and have done so for more than 20 years that may seem like a dream.
We are counting our blessings and we are excited that we can continue to make music together.
All we want and we are delighted to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world who always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What it meant for you have been an essential part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of big bands.
We are friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something rare.
From time to time, there is a gang of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten gangs are at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the group of Seattle.
Still we touch with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all of them yet and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like you stand united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joins us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much more time for many bands.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, have also been musical avenues open to give freedom to each of experience.
We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.
The relationship of you with the word fame has not been easy, however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.
How find a balance sheet?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We made sure not to be too tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big crowds and the people who love your music.
While one remembers that the people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought without encapricharse for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really interested in.
How recalls his another project Mother Love Bone?
I believe that we wrote very good songs and at first was a great thing.
We were a band for nearly three years and never published a disk until after his death Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still a fan of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how to make me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was an amazing human being and he will be.
The national The Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why the chose for the opening?
Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why are always changing the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings and I think that it does so with the first thing that will happen.
How downward, what are your influences?
So many.
Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many who could talk all afternoon on the falling that I adore.
How has managed to Pearl Jam keep relevant the grunge despite not being a fashion?
I believe that all of us we always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all that came at the same time, and, if there are important now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is music worth listening and Mudhoney bands and music are now doing better than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure and now has become more positive.
Why is this change?
It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem more light, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe who qualify as songs very dark but may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard the songs and are deeply dark.
I believe that when some trauma, and there are times in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs, of course, is that for me.
Also, I think it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is detained again for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was placed on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength that presented in the legs, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer in the language that has been operated on four times and that is kept under control.
The congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three dÍas at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of their lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said that he did not want to because they are innocent.
He was operated on four times of cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms in weight, which has joined other diseases such as severe erosiva gastritis, quiste pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in his legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori meets detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people at the hands of a squadron of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official convoy, led by the Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with a couple of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, highest point of a broad agenda of meetings with political leaders, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda from the presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information on what are the political issues between the two nations," according to published the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Caldrerón support Uruguay in the incident with France emerged when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included in the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community to those countries that remain tax havens, which led to the rejection of the so-called Uruguay and in consultation with its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico chairs since November, the G20, a group of the most powerful developed and emerging countries in the world, and is in force in the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), comprised of countries that do not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have in place since 2004, a Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber bigotudo is the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had done in three dimensions: In "Super Mario 3D Land" peleará for the love of the girl estereoscópica technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows us to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the person who has to say how it should operate the estereoscopía without glasses," asserted the official press Nintendo specialized in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the videogame in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first game of Nintendo originally expected for this support," because until now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a videogame "accessible" starting to enjoy a quick and smooth.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: The first part is "simple" to the entrapment users less skilled.
After the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of the game, this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose between a real-time "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
The raid of Super Mario in three dimensions is also the return of the character to a portable console, which was not since 2005.
This is Nintendo videogame wave to supporters of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of the previous deliveries, namely that the plumber will have to follow the whisker mined platforms of dangers with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new developments in the movement, settings, the costumes and the enemies and also a Luigi "jugable."
Colom endorses the extradition to the United States Portillo
President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that processed the extradition of exgobernante Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for conspiracy to the laundering of $70 million.
That is the end of the process to Guatemala to respond to the request of the country in the north that claimed to Portillo to judge there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision is due to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his tenure "got their hands" in judgments and gave trámite all extraditions that has known.
In addition to Portillo, will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What has been done by Colom is a trámite executive after exhausting all constitutional and judicial authorities to prosecute the exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the Criminal Court fifth and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once it has settled its legal situation in Guatemala and guarantee their human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that predated the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The body was born in order to avoid the drop in the outskirts of kids without training
The results of the first 25 years of the entity of social support Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of foreclosure have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over a quarter of a century.
In addition, the over 100 jobs made today for this social group.
The anniversary was yesterday to take stock in an event held in the old manufacturing complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, without work, with problems of dogradicción or fall on the sidelines.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused to a large number of entities and institutions in the last 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in full time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Along with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the Socialist Education exconseller, Ernest Maragall, and the mayor and current councillor exteniente ecosocialista Gomà Ricard.
Also went to the great hall of the Fabra i Coats Benestar conseller of the current Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current it is, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president made Trinijove as an example to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new to the company and for the work," he said.
Dislocated a farm where they were macrofiestas okupada
The invaders had grabbed 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of 51 neighbors living on the streets of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the midday yesterday illegally occupying the building, and where the neighborhood that desesperaban macrofiestas organized by court order and without police intervention.
When completed the operation, it changed the lock on the door to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be a control of access," said the manager.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest are habitados-, were all part of the electrical and water, in addition to paint the walls and leave waste of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverage cans.
The first three floors were the scene of massive celebrations, which lasted until two days and desesperaban tenants.
On the side of the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also has been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80 percent.
The owner of the discotheque notes that the invaders of the estate is unfair competition, which sold the canopy to three euros, while in the discotheque worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the lounge had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, he said, the problem is not the cause of the disco customers, but the inhabitants of the house okupada and, above all, those attending the celebrations that were organized there, that had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the problem was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "I will forgive" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the group of the PP in the municipal council, Alberto Fernandez Diaz, called for the week "to vacate the property immediately to deal with the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had come in all the floors of the building and in almost all the floors, and some even has been stolen.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be strong against the incivismo generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police went to the 35 street Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noted that four people came to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
How Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the appeal beyond controversy over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of the 1980s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed a Flyers Collserola promotion.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
What is more, perhaps a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few who do not follow the north-south axis but above (mountain) -abajo (sea).
The Collserola rating as a natural park is in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of Yogi Bear.
In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for so many doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors to the countryside.
The question is one: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its organizational merely side by posing as a reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the architects barceloneses.
It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected are recognized in an elevator.
And this is, in fact, one of the few similarities between what they believe three architects barceloneses, and university professors, that have been tabled.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayonne: The competition is appropriate.
For Roldán, having dealt with the coastline, "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain," as the speech Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out.
"There is the assumption that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "ruling the architect for the title of" doors of Collserola "contains a" trap léxica ": There is no question of them "as the entrance to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we need to act."
Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
The dangers of "uncertain that is now projecting the public space" after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the Fòrum "his swan song."
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on where they can build.
"Limit is set as the next step," that is, its sobrepaso.
"We need to think in new instruments urban planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to accidents."
The leaner, Mòdol believes that, by simplifying the Collserola vallesana aspect of "can be seen as a park, the Barcelona, not", merely topographic.
Mòdol points out that there is already a work done by the Collserola to examine "should not fall on deaf ears," although he was grateful for the opportunity that the council offers his body to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
And even more, he understood that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "no doubt" about whether it is this technical profile which must lead the multidisciplinary teams (" a success story, "says) that have had to create:" The architects should be just a tool. "
Bayonne suggests that the answer to the question that gives way to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the competition needed a global vision of Collserola: "Have been called 16 contests in cross-cutting montaña-mar himself, he says, but there is no longitudinal reading, to see and understand the area as a whole."
This is, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In other words, a project for one of the doors can clash in programme and definition of the architect of the next door.
In his view, however, the council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Round of Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgiven Jonás Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of curfew, the legal possession of the Casino Réseau awarded forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that he remained for alleged blackmail
After being 72 days in custody, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal possession of the Casino Réseau granted a pardon to the Second Court of Criminal District, which is a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Network, Sergio Gil Garcia, has published a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás requested economic contributions to the municipality regiomontano allowed the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After the public outcry, the state attorney-general's office opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother panista and on 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the official of the Public Prosecutor's Office for Crimes 3, therefore, was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the state.
There remained for 49 days following dictársele a second curfew order after the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office throw the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October was transferred to the prison in Cadereyta allegedly by blackmail with one and a half million pesos to the owners of the Casino Network; however, only for a few hours at the medium-security only because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the cells of the city of St. Nicholas Garza.
On October 25 arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Court of Criminal District, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months of investigations have found enough evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1.5 billion pesos to the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing the operation.
This Monday, the legal possession of Casino Network, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, came before the judge Jose Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the mayor's brother regio, so that in the next few hours could regain their freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned to Garcia Gomez if they had repaired the damage and who the partners of the gambling house was granted a pardon, although he tried to keep the name.
On the basis of the record 197 / 2011 is granted the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and in the future will not be able to stand any claim on the process that he was, and that it will require repair damage or punishment.
After the hearing the legal possession of the gambling house, near the 15: 50 ordered the immediate release of Bretton Larrazabal.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to prison in the town of St. Nicholas of Garza to notify Jonás that has been pardoned legally and his case will be dropped.
Also notified of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Interior secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results thrown on the accident which killed Interior secretary, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter had been directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without which the pilot could try to a hard landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before taking off the plane, the pilot found that weather conditions were right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed to 19 people, so we had the requirements needed to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that research in the area of the impact was not reported the emergence of pieces on the ground.
"In a search was reported that there are no spare parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact was so structural.
"The design of the helicopter was to 19 passengers, with appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a pending seven degrees to 30 degrees of bias.
For the moment, the secretary said he is a priority for the results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even a year could reach.
For his part, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director general of Airports and Related Services, claimed that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter operated in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ground upward.
"This strengthens the hypothesis of a normal operation cruising at the moment of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the LAS, Pérez Jácome, listed six key element in the investigation:
Visual flight:
Under the legislation in the aviation flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this means that the crew should have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM conditions were right to take off, as is the aircraft to the border area between the state and the Federal District of Mexico presented at low altitude cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that the cloud the crew has sought a lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last record of the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact, there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of remains of the aircraft in a limited area.
The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred in a straight path and hand.
The pattern of dispersal of the remains of the aircraft suggest that the helicopter had been on the ground in terms of structural integrity.
There has been no evidence of fire or explosion.
At the site of the disaster are still not be disclosed evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work has been found pieces of the aircraft to a rise of 9, 000 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground has a pending from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of bias.
The photographs show the sequence in which is expected to be disbanded along the way.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area cordoned off the site, about the accident, have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol for obesity gene
The Social Security is an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by most specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that directed an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents', which will count with markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry Hospital Medical of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that joined a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, social workers and nutriólogos.
The team is supported by scholars and students graduate from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (most).
The investigation was invited to participate or not, go to the sports participants of the IMSS units in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the State of Mexico (Sports Cuauhtémoc Poniente) and that since the October 8, the activity is carried out in the State of Mexico Sports Nezahualcóyolt (East).
Once it complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the southern Independence (Sports Unit of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify Mexican risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
To be held this November 14 World Diabetes Day, observed that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They are also being asked about physical activity and background heredofamiliares of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that triggered illnesses such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Saturday decided that applies to all participants anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeks to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this investigation is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming increase in weight in children.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 noted that in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, 77 percent in obesity, and girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight also saw a dramatic rise, highlighted the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is based on the country's population differs from other genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent and five percent of Africa and this is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability to burn excess energy (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if you have some degree of overweight or obese.
Indeed, he said, the presence of folds of color dark (acantosis) in neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and pre-diabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered in writing to the parents, who are explains each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be made to prevent diseases.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: Sedentarism, which is the lack of physical activity daily, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport rather than walk short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high in fats and proteins and genetic analyses in this protocol.
The bumpy asphalt UNAM would
Rafael Herrera, a senior researcher at the School of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Mexico Valley metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a senior researcher at the School of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who claimed that if the process of building and maintaining a pavement asfáltico is the right one, the potholes in amount could be reduced or even eliminated altogether.
In his conference A bumpy technological opinion, issued in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory to develop asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asfaltos could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, most of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight, so-called asfaltenos, and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give the pavement viscoelástico characteristic behavior.
Asphalt viscoelástico behavior is that at high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees Celsius presents an almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that changes during the day, according to environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by pavement flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the surface layers is the markings, consisting of small stones and then compactadas bathed in asphalt.
Each of the piedritas the folder, pointed out, is awash with asphalt.
The transit vehicles and generated efforts, it allows the forces spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt difundirían even better, she found the chemical engineer.
On the markings, abundó, it puts a final layer called rolling kit, which is made up of a fine stone materials, i.e., an arena that is also washes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, should take more mechanical force that the markings and provide friction along the way.
As part of the pavement will receive and impart the efforts, rolling it must also have the right thickness and must ensure that the material is made.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, he said, because it affects the performance of the markings.
When the ground is humedece, water available within the folder and it is difficult to leave, this leads to a thaw in all sections of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of formation of a bump, he said, is the first to wear dangerously thin film and only after rolling it affects the markings, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be addressed to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
Also a member of the National Research System burden.30 explained that the vehicle is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement should always be in connection with the burden of vehicles, and ensure that it is complied with, to ensure that they often bumpy.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the tar emulsion, which in other countries are already in the market and to repair the cracks easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What he lacked in the Valley candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the appetite of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the gang that the show as new princess of Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and sceptre, the department has risen to 14 degrees of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women who have been vallecaucanas near the crown but were proclamations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayalá (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question for many is what was missing?
Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that were queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key to the decision by the jury to give First Princess is that were not impressed with his answer to the question, "What is this book you set for yourself, and why? By Martin Murillo Gomez, the Literary Carreta Leamos.
To the interrrogante vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I think it is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I think the book that I set of childhood is" The principito ", the book is quite deep.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of world literature that we all need to read, and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called "The heat of blood".
A response that little was first by the term "culturalizarse" and second to explain exactly how each of the books cited the set.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said feel calm and happy with the result, "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The principito" is a great book "
Among the scenarios dropped says that in the Valley burned favouritism.
A journalist used in Bogotá suggested that to be the favourite, the ovations and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for best traditional dress, and Queen Mother), "that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó queen and therefore not shone in the scene."
And that was noted in his first presentation in bathing suits on the beach of the Hilton and her two parades in the evening of coronation.
Although both lució safe, it noted that lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic itself showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "As at home," Channel RCN felt that the fact that Melina outside designated princess "noted that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as queen."
In addition, Valle was the last very elusive with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that he failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is in the past, the essence of the National Competition for The Bold.
For one thing, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who is committed to the social needs of their country which.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, before entering the competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
There is also speculation that Valle first for their shortcomings in the derriere and fibrosis that he noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate with the 'natural' The Bold healthier body, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.
The preparador of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, "but the problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, the truth for me was not very visible, he dropped points on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were the surgery was performed.
"The surgery are good, but he is not the Valley.
His body was never his strong and here is the cost. "
For this award, which for the first time the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit was a cruel vaticinio that last night was, it was said that this was the CONTENTILLO that Raymundo awarded to Melina so as not to the taste of the crown.
True or not, the fact is that Melina from today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives him the chance to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of the National Competition.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming step in Cartagena, was elusive the crown.
This was the work of the caleño that identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopista Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November a lofoscopista of CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the main leader of the FARC, "Alfonso Cano," through the comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the regional branch of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" Eliazar Gonzalez, a man of Puerto Tejada is 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Cihocó, where many times had to start for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and then make the relevant courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, namely the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him wearing clothes for three days.
He expected something big.
On Friday night went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
I knew that was supposed to identify two bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who led to the world's oldest guerrilla, so I asked him to carry the 10-finger card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when it came to the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
Was without a beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the signs do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the card.
His eye was not ruled: Was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the main leader of the FARC.
In search of the mark
One of the Cali Sijín dactiloscopista recognition by the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar Gonzáles, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
The dactiloscopia is an exact science, with no margin for error, which may be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of those arrested.
When caught, many criminals are false ballots or have no papers.
We will take fingerprinting and seek in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was removing a piece of wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported its power to make a safe full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate areas to get a fingerprint -, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire and identify the offender, who had participated in various theft," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.
Recently, they found a man dead, with bottles of liquor around them.
The research found that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle was.
Although this does not guarantee that was the killer, located at the scene of the crime.
A dactiloscopista of CTI explained that the objects' fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. "
When they occur, used a transplantador or tape to lift them.
After that, the views are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the expert of the CTI.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI.
And not everything that is gold, not everything that it becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if it makes the comparison.
The "indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators in the square agolpaban Zuccotti to come.
A large part, the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The woman takes Wall Street movement challenged this Tuesday to the authorities in New York to try to come back, under the guise of a court order, to the square in Manhattan where they were evicted from early morning and try to take another park of the Gran Manzana.
Hundreds of demonstrators agolpaban at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allows the "outraged" to return to camp at the site, while another part of the movement said the eviction in a park to the north of the city, where there have been further arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we are going to install somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the leaders of the movement, "the woman takes Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray decided that the response of the "outraged" the eviction of the camp personally delivered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for a time managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the demonstrators, while Bray was unable to confirm the figure, while told Efe that saw several journalists who were handcuffed.
The organization says that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, which already has shifted a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which is due to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the demonstrators had posted so far at this time and passed out copies of the court order and even the officers were guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers allegedly beat demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities to evict members of the woman takes Wall Street or "laws that were published after the onset of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to regain access to the park with tents or other properties that previously used."
The mayor Bloomberg said to the press that, due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the area to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to be set up in tents and sleeping bags.
The regidor personally defended the eviction carried out of the night in the square Zuccotti, an operation that was about 200 arrests and decided that the demonstrators were "in violation of the law."
Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "in a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others," because "some business habÍan received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "failure to respect freedom of expression."
Those responsible for "the woman takes Wall Street" also indicated that they organize "major action" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months for the protests, which began on September 17.

The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," lifeguard on "Baywatch," conejita "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's Christmas to Russell Peters' on 1 December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
Today released CCTV images of the television programme in which Anderson, also known by the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which it appears with her then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a muñeco representing Jesus.

In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV's Christmas special with the Canadian singer Bublé, that at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato, and that there is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "fox" to the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
The GDP grew 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was at a standstill, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country nipón since World War II.
Initial estimates of the Tokyo government material losses estimated at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the equivalent of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter and a 6 percent annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the increase in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment in a 1.1 percent, compared with the 0.9 percent decline in capital expenditures to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real trigger for the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invited to take advantage of the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the development of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60 percent of Japan's GDP.
This variable climbed 1 percent, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan's currency - has become one of the "values haven" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for the US, a privilege that weighs as heavy in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large groups of technology.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blaming the weak results between July and September, the value of the yen.
While the markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower its guard.
"We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most of the member countries submitted in September more visible signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing down.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to the 100,8 August.
The euro zone, even fell below the average, which is in the 100, the rush to the eight tenths 99,13 points.
Athens is to feed doubts
Papadimos said that it will approve the adjustments, but the Conservatives did not sign a written commitment
With risk premiums peripheral fired and uncertainty reinstated in the wooden floors, Greece is stumbling into the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional government imposed by the Hellenic is more Brussels demands for a genuine belief that political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days agreed on his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, claimed that will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his call for new elections on the scheduled date, on February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26," asserted Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not deal with doubts about his position: "We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to any more."
The Conservative leader was a step further in its standoff with the EU and the IMF, agencies to unblock $8 million that Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will not agree to any letter of commitment to fulfilling the adjustments.
But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the referendum órdago of Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that their demand is strong: It will release the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties helenos does not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "that is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no deadline.
The Greek tangle is still up to now.
Sofia: "Are instruments for progress and hope."
The Queen is the "dominant" of Spain in relation to this kind of finance
"Spain has reached a dominant position globally in the role of the Microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has made in the past two decades in the second donor raises in relation to this tool of cooperation, the "essence" noted that is to be "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World of the Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that is kind of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, especially, which aims to reduce by half the number of people living on less than a dollar per day, which sets the poverty line. "
Spain "is working" to expand the network of beneficiaries' to all corners of the globe, and takes this task with "responsibility," said Sofia, who waited for the efforts and contributions originating in the summit, which runs until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of new skills and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women," the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to promote "two basic goals."
So, His Majesty explained that he hopes that by the end of 2015 are 175 millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and that 100 million of those homes out of the poverty line in which they are living.
The momentum in the concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path that began years ago as a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, I emphasise Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition."
It described the father of this tool as a "idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work known for 15 years ago, when the Queen visited Bangladesh to see on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other events, such as those in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "all I could see the continuing evolution," explained His Majesty, whose connection with this project gave him yesterday described as the "head of household" gathered in Valladolid on the part of the "Baquero of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofia concluded his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that the solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, explained that it would be a mistake to link the cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, which is "a permanent obligation."
Jimenez found that microcredit pose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever," the governments of developed countries should work on the basis of solidarity and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
For his part, Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" to "confidence" to the people "who excluded all the doors "; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon of the Riva, welcomed the present to a city that" opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. "
The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage European
The first day of the congress of the Union (Christian Democrat) and European Democrats (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
Initially had not been included in the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that government policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
The 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.
The standing Ovation for several minutes to be won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, removes any doubt as possible.
The main thrust of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: The response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
The Chancellor, "the time has come to lead the way in Europe."
This could be in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe."
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, a clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Indeed, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to ponder the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which would strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to ease tensions within his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is trying to win its conference at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the Franco-German friendship, "Angela Merkel has not mentado to France.
Except passing.
Recalling that two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats in the army of Napoleon.
The incidence of fraud in the sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government undertake an offensive against the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a responsible for family allowances and delivered a speech on the subject, as recurring since 2007, the fight against fraud and social ayudantía.
In addition, to accompany this offensive, that part of the desire to save rigorously, but still remembers an axis of the presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: The government is planning to workers in the private sector a fourth day of absence before they can take the low.
In short, unless there is a specific company convention, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' wages, that is to say, a minimum of 15 percent of their monthly income.
It is a measure that would lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic: Impose officials a day of absence without pay in case of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
As we discuss these issues, the majority is put on the table the issue of fraud, this time directed towards the abuses of the casualties.
"They will be significantly increased controls and, furthermore, if someone is caught committing a fraud, will have to repay the amounts," said Xavier Bertrand said on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seemed slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of casualties.
In fact, since 2002, is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit.
The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.
Watch carefully, first of all, the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006, was paid more than EUR 237 million in benefits to leave.
According to the French Institute research and documentation of the economy, health, subsidies for the casualties were, in 2008, 5 percent of health care spending, rising to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46 per cent to maternity and accidents, while 54 percent is related to the sick leave, a figure that rises to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, the 2.5 percent of spending on health care.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
An average that, without doubt, hides diversions: Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the 40,000 employees French respondents said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37 percent of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22 percent of between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent of between 15 days and one month, 15 per cent of between one and three months and 11 percent were longer.
Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10 percent and 11 percent, compared to a 20 percent and 28 percent in Denmark, a 15 percent in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
The fraud has a very limited.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to the controls of the sick leave more than 45 days to be systematic.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to regular inspections, found that 11 percent of the cases were "properly tailored or unjustified, a figure that, starting as a total of 1.2 million, $132,000.
Therefore, there is a total of $169,000 cases "unjustified" among several million workers to pick up a sick leave.
Without doubt, negligible compared with, for example, the black economy.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, the practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 million euros a year, or more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, of course, considerably more than the fraud in this area.
Papadémos: Greece must implement a new restructuring plan
Greece is going to need a new restructuring plan to restore its economy.
This is what you said on Monday, November 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament, he added that the 100 days that have been given to his government would not get together to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of the government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, "is at stake," the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "until about 9 percent of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching a 10.6 percent in 2010 and a 15.7 percent in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, showed on Monday its support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his party "New Democracy."
Said that he agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and the EU desbloquearían the loan of $8 billion euros needed without a written guarantee of cross-party support for the measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide
Canadians are denying the death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
The Canadian company is denying the death.
In fact, only 9 percent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take measures to that effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts in various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical doctor.
The committee recommended the government to amend the criminal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For a start, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is the 10th position, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians want to die at home, just 68,6% of them dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate recorded in this regard the Quebec, where 86 percent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that are not in line with the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it wants to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts who have studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its implementation, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not responsible or who had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries that have not been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
"In Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada is assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians, euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, because we believe that would allow people whose death is next to ease their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010.
In addition, 66 percent believed that legalizing euthanasia will not to understand that the lives of the elderly and disabled has less value.
As for the people who have been assisted suicide, 41 percent of respondents believed that it should not start proceedings against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations suggest that indicated in the penal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls to train health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in connection with palliative sedation or terminal, which is already used extensively in health institutions in Canada, the committee asked that, except that will serve to reduce the physical pain, is seen as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it restricts the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted yesterday, a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any value to society.
However, he added that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which he called "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questioned the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is legal, as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls to President al-Assad to leave power
Damascus a "plot".
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday to the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad that, with the support of Russia, the reluctant and claim that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have spoken out in favour of the abandonment of power by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to yesterday called on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where they have already died 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime.
"If Bashar really cares for his country, he should resign, in addition to create the conditions for a new phase of political life in Syria," said the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview to the BBC.
For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has complained that the mediation efforts that has made Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and will not be able to satisfy them, will be leaving," said alluding to Syria, neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For his part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that it has "strengthened the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime in Syria.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tough tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, have already killed 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces in the region of Deraa in southern Syria, according to announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGOs.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, believes that the country is moving towards the end of the crisis. "
In addition, has reacted strongly to the Arab League decision to suspend damasco of their duties, which in his view is "a dangerous step."
Syria "will definitely not," he added, ensuring that "cooked up plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is considering a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians against the regime's repression that, in his view, it is in the "paranoia."
He is scheduled to hold a special meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat to fine-tune the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has tried yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan out of the crisis, although not stated his support for the implementation of sanctions against Damascus.
Italy,
Monti calls time on the markets and sacrifices Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time to markets to form his team and put in place a program that will include "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility over the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
Should be a relatively limited cabinet, composed of technocrats outside the Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups who participated in the meetings, having met with the President of the Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti called Friday before a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with the presentation by Mr Monti, a limited list, certainly a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has said the nervousness of the stock markets and bond holders yesterday, asking them time.
"Democracy, there is a precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "confident that the markets will have patience and understand this."
His appointment by President initially won the approval of the markets, but then imposed the concern, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if it has stressed that he would like to include "political."
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, believes.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will win the vote of confidence in Parliament earlier on Friday.
Monti is committed to that, when I take office, will work in view of the urgency and with the aim of Italy "to regain its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn noted that "even with a new government, there will be no change in our assessment of the Italian economy."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted during the past few months, has called for the adoption of new austerity measures.
"The head of the chiefs' Italians Emma Marcegaglia, you will see the kill, insisted on the need to boost the economy," as a country that is not growing cannot meet the requirements in terms of deficit. "
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" to Italy after 17 years of "berlusconismo "; the" teacher "symbolizes" the challenge of the seriousness "and" another Italy, "according to the editorial page.
The big question will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put before April 2012 some 200 million euros in bonds.
A Russian scientist has worked with the Iranian nuclear program.
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has worked with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used in a nuclear weapon, according to the Monday, an American NGO specialized in the nuclear risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the agency of the UN.
Last week, the IAEA expressed "serious concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS, extensively in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, when a Soviet military nuclear facility in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by the explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led to contact in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, it is believed that cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA said that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing a nuclear detonation system" with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique, but also, according to a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career in the technology in the military nuclear programme of their country of origin.

The crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen by 50%
The crimes and offences against Muslims have risen nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the other types of racial and religious violence has decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is to say, has increased by 49 percent, compared with an increase of 13 percent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 percent in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14 percent in the number of crimes and offences anti-religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to the 6.628 cases, of which a 47.3 percent due to racial and religious differences to 20 percent, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that has risen this type of crimes and offences," stressed the human rights organisation Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long argued that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible for the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and should strive to put an end to these abuses," he adds, considering that these efforts could include an improvement of police reports on the "crimes of hate."
The "hate crime" in the US federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
The legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, colour, religion, descent and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and is more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday changed his platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who remain, which means that their service looks a little more to Facebook.
A new pages "activity" and other so-called "name" offer more legiblemente and direct the activities of other "Twittos", that is, those whose Internet messages (" tweets ") is on the Internet or to follow you.
This makes it possible to know if they give up messages, if paid to new accounts, if considered favorite any message, etc.
This new formula of Twitter tested "with a small percentage of users in August" well before the rest of the network on Monday, according to spokesman told AFP the Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation just instinctively, with terms slightly esoteric (RT to send a message to another person, a suivre followfriday pour recommander of other utilisateur) faisant le he des initiés, ouvre's and a public plus large avec a maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook and Google +.
On the Net, users have discussed to "tweet" with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, it is invasive and too similar to Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The event will help me to better some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria.
The introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The grand coalition government of Social Democrat / Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" to reduce the budget deficit and avoid a possible deterioration of the note by Austria's sovereign credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the same Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt stands at 74.6 percent, a figure much higher than the ceiling of 60 percent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If you reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay $3 billion more in interest each year," said the Vice-Chancellor said Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels summit to member countries of the euro zone last October 26: In it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and restoring the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The measure adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," as Germany was the first European country that adopted such "rule."
By 2017, the structural deficit should fall each year in a 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the federal government's structural budget deficit should not exceed each year 0.35 percent of GDP, while the regional states, as well as communities, should present balanced budgets.
The goal is that by 2020 / 2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60 percent set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threat with a new exchange market intervention
The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again marking the change if the yen continues to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we see that there is an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to a level close to the record highs that led to the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the US currency.
But the yen has been increasing steadily since then, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar's value again Tuesday, at least 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar 105 yen, reaching levels close to those who caused the last speech.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar stood at around 120 yen and the euro in more than 160 yen.
This explosion of Japan's currency hurts exports of the archipelago, which makes products made in Japan and reduces the value of revenue earned abroad by Japanese companies when converted to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), stressed Noda, who feared that the rise of the yen because of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to a surge in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic fundamentals of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday, a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," implying that it should not expect greater currency flexibility on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the institute of emissions increased by five trillion yen (47 million euros) their purchases of Treasury bills, taking 55 trillion yen (519.000 million euros) the threshold of the funds for the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro zone:
Growing rates, the stock markets falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is hurting the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the countries with the highest rates weakened continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets sink a little more negative in the area on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and to 3.064 points.
In Frankfurt the DAX lost 0.4 percent and 0.1 percent in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions in connection with the returns of loans from the eurozone states most affected, stock markets around the world are paying some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are well aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters news agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7 percent, renewing the concerns of the players in the market in Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a small variations, so that investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of the concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a fall of 0.4 percent.
According to brokers, has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion, which provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty coming out of the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates of Italy and Spain are very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2 percent.
These tensions on interest rates in the countries of the south, but also of France, are fueling fears of auditors.
The head of the future government Italian, Mario Monti, has asked for time to markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being smothered under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, while the Sunday legislative elections will be held there.
The difference in rates (" spread "between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new record high.
In anticipation of the growth figures for the euro
Statistically, France has been an economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, a figure that is more favourable than the 0.3 percent expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stalemate.
In addition, the fourth quarter is really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 percent in the same period.
For the initial forecast for the euro zone as a whole at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts are worth more than the dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be treated with short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate that an election meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if it is all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposals.
The French must base its opinion on facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic changes will mean a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 unless depriving a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, we will have to deal with the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
For this reason, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case and Belgium, which makes it to the need to find a source that can replace it, and Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art facilities.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, determined to go ahead with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to the park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes as an example, the reality is against such a speech.
The choice of Berlin will lead to a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of coal and gas stations.
In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects.
We must think about the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind industry, which gets 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittency; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours paid an electricity bill by 40 per cent higher than the French households.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the utility industry in the country, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear power would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would remove realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, they are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Let us remember that energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international markets and that can create jobs not deslocalizables.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would be the sacrifice of a lot of these SMEs and the loss of $6 million per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What would an electrician EPR designed to operate 60 years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as there is a diabolical source.
The development by Areva solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority exercises strict control and transparent on both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, was in normal operating conditions; no consequences for the people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and human error unforgivable.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by a natural disaster of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR is a design that can resist such phenomena.
While the study all the players who want to build a power plant, the termination of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to competitors of Areva and EDF, because that would leave them free rein to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear industry.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvering dominasen such an important debate to the economic, social and financial of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised starting from various points of view: The saturation of law enforcement, judicial and administrative policy under the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers and waiters."
However, rarely looked at from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction in 1976, declaring that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of the invasion of the country by a crowd of plumbers.
On both sides, it believes that immigrants are a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the level of generosity with acting with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the co-development will solve the problem of migration. "
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is profitable electorally, but economically is very expensive.
Economists such as Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 665-672.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration harms the weakening growth and employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their salaries.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for domestic workers are mainly in professions and sectors with a lack of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract skilled workers in national and most dynamic sectors where the training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that has no surgeon, complementarity between nationals and immigrants means that the arrival of the latter have a positive impact on wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows is a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9 percent.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and to economic growth, there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1 percent of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average during his lifetime.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find points of growth that it was "with teeth."
These teeth, to stop immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, you only need to think in a European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember it because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century has been the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may believe that for democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies, would be enough to exercise the vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon "Little," that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, but it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and may even become a tool of oppression, "said the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, Luces, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political crisis and democratic.
The Greek referendum palinodia verdadero-falso had, in this regard, a double effect revealing: Showed the need for a strong return to the political arena, but also the disturbing sense of their failure, his inconsistency.
We should consider this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the battle has moved democratic and, in many cases, the soldiers Republicans already are not moving in the right direction.
It stands to gain if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized around the needs and in disarray.
A blank cheque to the European monarch absolute or a high into the void of nationalist hole: What options for the citizen.
No, we do not want to get beaten, but a joint exercise, full, calm and steady, options and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would have no idea where the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is that it is bowing to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe is a humiliation in the international arena.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is slowly losing the sovereignty and, with it, every one of their nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty back to the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare their future through investments.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having long struggled against this proposal from the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world calls for a European economic governance.
That it.
But think about it without further political integration and democratic, and without being seen as such by the people, it would be a new madness and lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take a new phase of European integration.
To build the Republic in France, was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applies.
We need to build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
In order to build Europe, we Europeans.
Chip cards with "no contact" is widespread
The hall of the global chip cards begins Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic mood.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11 percent increase in global sales of computer cards, bank cards, phones and SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 million units, according to calculations by the cabinet Eurosmart.
The segment is the most powerful technology without contact, to pay the transport purchases or simply moving the card into a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year.
Its quota should continue to increase is expected in 2012 (580 million units) and represent about 10 percent of the global market for the cards with chip cards (6,925 million).
Europe, which has long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the area of payment without contact.
Some 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 are using Visa cards without contact.
But the large areas working for four.
Carrefour has issued this year, 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To get the gear, however, it is necessary that the banks made available to their customers.
"There are two big French establishments that have pledged to disseminate regularly in the future, among its clients, bank cards without contact with the system," says Gerard Nébouy, general manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove the payment by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: The mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with technology NFC (Near Field Communication), essential to make transactions.
"Are falling behind."
"But it should finally have a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that it will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 in the whole world," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhone is continuing to about 200 customers and partners with a cover that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société Générale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer to allow their customers to pay without contact via their mobile.
The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers as "is a certainty."
"The way in which the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French nationals in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey for people involved in Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day, along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the Nigerian and French researchers discovered several telephone chips that belonged to terrorists.
Of terrorist axis
The study of the calls made out to several players based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially attracted the interest of researchers: One leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other a man who reportedly is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we certainly should expect to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign intellectual and financial support and that is becoming more active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support" had been increasingly evident in the development and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational methods, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and in the same way that the used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since then pushing Muscat to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considered the group as a community of enlightened unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin "), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a quick success.
Be politicized and requires a strict respect of Sharia law, while its militants launched the fight against the central government godless.
They are first to churches, bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants were particularly active and increased attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Muscat was, as so often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and there were 800 people dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect is even sharper and abandoned their strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, claims an attack that causes 80 killed in Jos and, later, another in Muscat.
In June, Boko Haram returns to attack against Muscat, in particular the protection of the police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations in his first international goal.
The creation of an axis of terrorism in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria, anxious to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and that the Somalis Al-Chebab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been increasingly estruendosas statements and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Spread the slogans, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best positioned in the race for the nomination for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to lead to the Chinese in the WTO and, where "by manipulating its currency," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of fragments of the entire sector to Asia.
As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that "apabulla 'emotions.
Has called for a dialogue, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which is stalled in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.
The Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, will stop Iran," fanfarroneó.
"If Obama gets re-elected, will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed to meet its obligations in connection with this partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the candidate with the second best classified, shows a shameful lack of such issues.
Recently, urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
The Governor Rick Perry tejano, which supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, said that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also recommend Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
There are considerable differences with the Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President answered that Reagan was also simple ideas and who won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the pistón in the fight against terrorism.
Rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit of the "boys" of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The judge in a more positive assessment of Obama's national security, which ended with bin Laden.
In Iraq, is wary of military interventions that generate a collapse.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild economically America to revive his leadership, Obama appears to be more fair.
The Nord Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly to Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
To supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the wheel of the valve that controls the flow of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, each year will 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe through a first had to 1,224 km told the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburgo-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover the entire French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same way.
For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge project has winds of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries were firmly opposed to the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In one fell swoop, these two countries lose some of its power: For them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatened to block his access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new Nazi-Soviet pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, to support the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a gap between the Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has, in just five years, to succeed his vision of an alliance between Russia and Western countries rich, major consumers of gas reserves and increasingly limited.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organically," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing the extent to which the big gas contracts are so political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine is made of steel pipe recubierto of cement to protect it against the anchors of ships.
Based on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 metres deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precautionary measure," says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream.
Also, it was necessary to step up measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted along its entire length, or valves, or maintenance stations.
Scheduled a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but officials declined to project the same to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company was permanently in the sea off its coast.
"In the event of failure, suspending the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas pipeline will be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders are unlikely to see a flight because they have planned junturas, according to forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged down by a ship, which is carrying out inspections, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, introduces inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, provides accurate data on possible distortions of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without any kind of repair.
The movement of the gas is simply because of the pressure.
The principle is 200 bars and, at the end of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project.
The company leader is Gazprom, which owns 51 percent of the shares.
To her, joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5 percent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9 percent each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
Has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.
Later, Gazprom rented in this society, for a period of 25 years, renewable, all of the gas transmission capabilities.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30 percent with the input of shareholders and a 70 percent through bank loans.
The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that it will exceed its investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk alone.
The pipeline is emerging in the Baltic in Lubmin, planted in a sandy coast.
Some valves, with 4.5 metres high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas to the arrival, before being transferred to the Germans.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a book of.
Founded half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.
Has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with their black rectangular pasta, rubber, its white sheets, as old at the time.
However, the current with the Moleskine notebooks were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, saw the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an ancient technique of production, the huge amount of mole skin (skin), which refers to a cotton barnizado used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of book was highly valued by the writers and travellers.
"The current moleskine has adapted to an old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century," Maria Sebregondi, since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Confidential production has been far from the early years, in which were only 3,000 books.
Moleskine goes beyond the borders of Italy and export their products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the report card attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and cults.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers at its inception, now has nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
Distributed their notebooks in bookshops, since the Fnac to small shops in the centre of the city, and has been able to impose their identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This signature cultural goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists presented their own notebook.
In August, also launched a notebook with covers of leopard, the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this aura cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: Handbags, notebooks, pens, veneers of computer... The brand covers a wide range of media.
A success that causes envy: In the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was bought by the investment fund, GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, escribiéndose a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of the disabled workers remains so high?
About 19 percent of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is twice the average rate of 19 per cent, compared with 9 percent for the whole of the population.
How grim?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the last 15 years are considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still much to be done."
It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled still face many obstacles to access to employment.
Tend to have an older age: 37 per cent has more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 percent had not finished high school, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53 percent for the disabled, compared to 38 percent on average.
That is to say, there are many issues that hinder the return to work and that is the crux of the problem, "says Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.
These are the obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people moving, but too slowly.
A survey conducted in April by the association for the Cite IMS-Entreprendre managers surveyed said they have "a level of knowledge about disability under," with "a large proportion of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectual."
The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of recruiting a 6 percent of disabled workers, a goal set by law... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating back to 2008, at a ratio of 2.6 percent.
"Now we reached around 3 percent," says Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the agency in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law.
The test: The number of establishment "under this provision," as well as the amounts disbursed, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this also reflects a real awareness, especially among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 percent of companies with between 20 and 49 workers with disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
To face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that creates this friendly match.
We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the floor of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really have made peace.
Five months after the gesture of resentment of his front against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praise for him.
"I was very pleased by Eden, for their progress and because it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," she said the striker of Lille.
In terms of the contrast between their presentations in his team and in the selection, "as a whole," has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to put myself."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account the match against France, Hazard in Saint-Denis to, finally, "shine."
But forget the "pleasure."
Has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years, as well as for the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been a fan," says.
Without doubt, this will strengthen especially the character "particular" of the meeting.
Especially because it will face "(Mathieu Debuchy), Yohan Cabaye (() and Adil Rami)," recalls.
"We have just face recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has done for its reference to the "pride."
"Pride" in play "a gala party."
"Pride" in check, "neighbor," that France "is a very high level," nearly a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share with the Bleus aircraft to... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You will see in the next few games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Portugal's Paulo Bento is faced with great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the party ticket, lacked realism to both teams.
"When the full 90 minutes, we will be a team happy and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, just 90 minutes away to Portugal of happiness.
But there is a party to play and a rival, Bosnia, that defeat.
Taking into account the party ticket (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not resolved.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but was unable to make the precious goal that would have given the peace.
"It is a good result, but at the same time, there is a risk, because we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the party "is well matched," dixit a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We hope that the party is well matched, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We still have a 50 per cent chance of participating in the Euro 2012," has, however, narrowed the successor of Carlos Mr. Queiroz.
The tie on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but also need to score.
"It is a good result, but at the same time, there is a risk, because we have not scored away from home," laments Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has a high technical quality and that no individual players with great quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercise, from the outset, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave no time to think."
A good idea, provided that, this time, is realistic.
