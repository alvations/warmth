The European inflation slipped into food
Rapid, inflation in the eurozone, it must first of all of the rapid growth of the price of food products.
The increase in prices in the November was higher than what had been expected in the 13 countries of the eurozone, registering - after the 2.6% of October - an annual inflation of 3.1% - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The official estimates were probably only as a 3%, announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the central banks, British, American and Canadian not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the reduction, together with the increase in the price of raw materials and the reduction of unemployment forced labour, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the rate of inflation below, but at least around 2%.
According to a analysts, the ECB is in the trap 22: "We must negotiate" on inflation to subsequently does not have to intervene in this matter.
The inflation of 3.3%, which was registered in Germany, that record of twelve anos; whereas in espana rose from 3.6 to 4.1%.
Inflation is shot in the eurozone as a result of the galopantes food prices and energy.
To wind up the wheat prices rose by 88% and also the contributions of soya reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, it was necessary to pay much more on the 2007 for the vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market has increased in this Ano 52%, achieving since last month the black gold around 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will 2.1% currently to 2.5%, whereas for the 2009 will fall to 1.9.
According to the analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next three or four months around 3%, but the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that during the Ano 2008 the ECB reduces twice interest rates.
Gallup provides for a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December supported by the alliance of young Democrat increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, whereas the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 per cent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the electorate certain parties - due to the greater firmness of the electorate in the opposition - would be a support of more than two thirds (a 71%) with the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic forum and the referenda were not free or the limit will need to take some escano: its support within the entire population is 2%.
Among the electorate sure there is a one per cent more sympathisers on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point earlier - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who believed particularly bad the country ’ s economic situation, while another 46% believes that the situation is very poor.
Families, after the most optimistic expectations of the spring and the summer, are now more pessimistic with regard to change its own economic situation.
As regards the Ano next, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expected improvements.
In December, the 71% of those questioned, figure greater than any previous Gallup poll, thought that the head of government desempena more harm than good.
The 13 per cent of those questioned hopes or have a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor orbán enjoys the support of the 38% of those questioned.
A 54% of the population is not in any way in the head of government and a 27% is not at the President of the Alliance for young people democrats.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to monitor the discontent experienced in the person of head of government without a change of government.
Whilst after riots October of last Ano a 35% considered that it would be desirable to maintain in the power of the government and the head of government, this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believes that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterised by the fact that 60% of those questioned on the question of the participation replied that I would certainly and another 20% said that is likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "general elections to be held this Sunday 'security engages with just one 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believes likely their participation, on the basis of the intentions of the voters there can be no doubt of the outcome of the referendum.
A 74 per cent of the population take a dim view the payment of the rights of studies, 79% of the service of medical consultations and 84% the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions solely between the participants safe in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the electorate reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment by the medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the auchan Tesco, has its price fivefold
The average continued to increase the level of prices on a 16% of the trade supermarkets triangle gold budaörs, with the difference that this Ano has not been increased VAT.
Article of napi gazdaság
This Ano also increased by an average of 16% of trade budaörs golden triangle of the usual canasta Christmas of everyday napi, but in all the hypermarkets, there was a much higher growth one thousand huf.
As in December of last Ano had already been "triggered 'prices in the supermarkets in food, so it is not received a percentage drastic increase in comparison with the high point of departure.
However, obviously it is terrifying to consumers the fact that what the Ano past were able to buy a price below the nine thousand huf, today cannot be either by ten thousand.
The canasta of napi in supermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 huf the psychological limit of ten thousand huf.
And the canasta more high value was 10 573 huf.
(in the Ano 2003 that canasta was 6800 huf.)
The price of spirits unique event and fish remained almost at the level of the previous Ano, but there was a significant increase in the pechuga steak of Turkey, of the nut and the seeds of poppy.
The price of bread wheat and followed the data from the Central Statistics Office, although in the auchan we have found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 huf.
Competition does not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 huf.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with bottle redimible two litres was less than 200 huf, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, was only 257 huf.
Nevertheless, in the canasta of napi auchan was the more expensive, as cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with regard to the price of Christmas past of Ano cora increased with 15%, while Tesco and auchan with around 18% in the price of napi canasta.
Comparing the values of canasta Ano more expensive in the past with the canasta cheaper this Ano, the gap has been a 12%, while growth between the cheapest of Ano past and the more expensive this Ano has been a 21%.
The average growth was 1480 huf.
The Ano past the average growth of prices was of 1206 huf so that during the Christmas past of Ano prices were increase in VAT.
It is precisely this process was destroyed than that trade, supermarkets visibly were unable to take a decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to calculate the effects of change in prices on consumption.
(if the trader bad planning the speed of the movement of a product, cannot lose an important benefit in the margin which conforms to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the canasta of napi reached such lengths to increase VAT, the more expensive was greater than with 1720 huf the value in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was just one 844 huf.
This did not happen Ano such extremes, since the high price of has now been 1630 huf more than the Ano past and the cheapest also increased with No 1284 huf.
Comparing the two seasons navidenas, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets grew by more than 30% the price of articles of consumption of first need.
(but not necessarily confirms that the figures for the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foods of first need registered in the intervening period of 12 months a price increase of over 30%.
For example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the canasta of napi, in the latter case it seems almost impossible, because in the price of the product that was quite expensive because the Ano compared to the past, there was, in the worst case, scarcely a 10% increase in prices.
According to all the rates or the suppliers of meal have a stronger position than those of egg and impose the dramatic increase in prices even to the multinationals.
The hypermarkets not complain in the triangle of gold, constantly talking about positive results.
According to our experience garnered, the majority of consumers of the three shops already visited, are not interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, and by paletas preserved food.
In the manana on Wednesday, in the three shops formed huge queues ahead of the coffers because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that inside the country volumes of sale are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the institutes of inquiry because incomes are below its plans, and not only in the case of food, but also in the electrical appliances.
In many hospitals being saved with organophosphorous sheep
This Ano have been registered in hospitals several thousands of infections caused in the first place by the improper use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions prevailing in hospitals, overcrowding in their beds and overloading of staff are not conducive to the control of infections - or of the médica-jefa department of the national centre of epidemiology.
In many hospitals saves even with organophosphorous sheep.
Not so long ago, has been diagnosed with mrsa spreads in the department of traumatología jános hospital.
In a man admitted after a serious accident salmonellae were bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of infection in this same hospital at the beginning of the Ano.
To a wounded a serious road accident given high the hospital and the same patient shortly afterwards should return to hospital as a result of the infection with mrsa and since then we have not been able to make an important surgical intervention by the presence of in its establishment.
Until 10 December this Ano have occurred in national system nosocomialis surveillance 1094 cases of in-hospital infection from multi-resistant agents - said karolina böröcz médica-jefa department, of national centre of epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals surely there has been this amount of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, the rest is information.
Nearly two thirds of infection cases (683) should be the mrsa, namely the aureus staphylococcus, which is resistant to meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of human beings have their bacteria nose of staphylococcus aureus (SA) without causing any disease.
Infections caused by the SA (for example: inflamación of the neck, amigdalitis cutáneas infections, infections, wounds) react to antibiotics and are easy to treatment.
However, once the exaggerated or inappropriately applied to antibiotics, bacteria that are normally well to antibiotics, it becomes bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and spread rapidly in conditions, hospital inadequate.
Can cause serious hospital infections, for example infections of injured or endotoxic shock firstly to patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency to patients with a weakened body, the elderly and people of little weight.
In the opinion of the hospital jános médico-director there is nothing in the infection of mrsa, these infections are in hospitals.
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, the only mrsa is absent - said tibor nyulasi - where there is examined your presence.
Which is resistant to antibiotics
"these patients are isolated, nursing staff serviced in kid Goma and containers and there are antibiotics suited to their treatment '- said tibor nyulasi.
The hospital are being examined beforehand to verify the presence of mrsa in his body, but even so it can prevent infection in all cases.
It is fashionable sample
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of the mrsa in the majority of cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not help to prevent the formation and infection with pathogens multi-resistant - States karolina böröcz.
As this infection is basically grown in hospitals and old people's homes, hospitals should examine the hospital and isolate immediately the enfermes who have their the mrsa body.
However, in hospitals Hungarians has gone out of fashion the sampling microbiological characteristics.
This is also because the national health box not funding these medical examinations.
So that the majority of cases the publicized when they do occur because of mrsa infections visible in the patient - he said the médica-jefa of department of the centre.
The European Union is rigorous encomiendas for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to deal with infections and pathological tables.
We must empenarse that treatment with antibiotic directed, in other words, it should make microbiological examinations to prevent resistance to medicines, but the hospitals do not always comply with this requirement.
The sampling microbiological characteristics are even less prevalent in the case of the mobile patients or basic health care - said karolina böröcz.
It saves with organophosphorous sheep
The scientific tests have shown that in the majority of cases, or mrsa a patient to another through the healthcare personnel.
Therefore, desempenan a very important role in the washing their hands, the use of kid Goma and masks, but in this respect too, we are experiencing considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
The mrsa or through the transmission by drops and the direct contact between people, but national hospital in the circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the patient contagiado.
What is more, cinemas, hospitals are often overcrowded beds, many of them are very together, but to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 m.
Unfortunately we can experience too - imposition karolina böröcz - that in hospitals in less favourable economic situation being saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and why there is a better chance for the infection.
In the opinion of karolina böröcz, where they meet the appropriate preventive measures, there are fewer diseases of this kind or can stop the spread of agent.
Against the government's programme mrsa
The treatment of infection with mrsa is huge spending to the national insurance, so that all the countries to fight against it.
In Britain for example there is a government programme to prevent and reduce the number of cases of mrsa.
The programme has successes, according to the data provided, with mrsa infections are tending to decrease in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is among the priorities for the prevention of multi-resistant agents (among these the mrsa) and of the hospital infections are due to these pathogens.

Bulgaria, the paradise EU property
It is the development of the Bulgarian property market - the attention of the whole of Europe is moving towards this Balkan country little mentioned before.
What, where and those who buy on the market even cheaper for the EU, which is rapidly will add anything?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of re / Max.
The objective preferred to the property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is certainly Bulgaria, with its cheap flats the skiing areas and the villa on the beaches.
The regions montanosas of bansko, borovec pamprovo vitosa, and are the most preferred, whereas in the beaches albena, the 'golden coast ", the" Costa sun', the former sozopol and nesebar, but more and more people looking for work in the vicinity of kavarna and balchik.
According to analysts re / Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later it will also the central part of the country - as veliko tarnovo, gabrovo, Elena, triavna - will attract the interest of the property developers and more and more people buy property in the area especially cheap rus.
Similarly may be appealing the capital Sofia, the commercial areas and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of the most atrayentes on golf course in Europe, which could be a destination also highlighted in the other two stations, in addition to the summer and winter.
Therefore, careful investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of bansko.
In view of the analysts, those who buy property in Bulgaria, are trying to change their lives and their way of life.
The majority of customers are British, but are also in France, Belgium, espana and increasingly in Romania.
They are also present the promoters Maltese and Cypriots and there are many Russians traditionally clients on the beaches of the Black Sea and the ski havens.
Foreign customers can be placed in three groups - says Georgi jankov, regional director of re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who seek to settle here buy property new or revised by a price between 50 and 100 000 euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 000 euros, for renovarlas then.
Good communication and require access, in addition to them is important the imminence of a large city, shops and generally of a doctor local.
They constitute the second category purchasers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first ten holiday destinations of Germans).
The third group are building investors who do their shopping in the hope of benefit in the medium or long term.
The price of property capitalinos is in constant growth, since the demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union, Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices over the last five anos these have suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of property considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians for
According to inform the Environment Minister and hidrología gábor fodor the meetings at expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime post-2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Roadmap of balí about the efforts made available after the period of reducing emissions, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, valid until 2012.
They are currently being carried out lively discussions about this in the developing countries and industrialised.
The United States has already pointed out that at the moment does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although tends to reach the agreement that in comparison with the situation in 1990, until the Ano 2020 down with a 25 to a 40% the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major issue of the Conference is that if the industrialised countries, and reduce emissions, are prepared to provide material and technical assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement was reached in addition on aid to offer to the developing countries.
The support fund, laid down in the Kyoto Protocol, it will be led by a management board composed of 16 members, probably within the global fund for the environment of the UN) - (gef writes the "piac profit-sharing is".
The six by hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Environment Minister and hidrología gábor fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reduce until 2020, with regard to the 1990 level in 20% of gas emissions, who is responsible for the greenhouse effect, irrespective of whether or not to be signed the agreement after 2012 'and is ready to engage in reducing even a 30% if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also prepared to make compromises in accordance with its responsibility and its capacities.
Gábor fodor pointed out that countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol 1997 undertook to reduce in a 5.2%, within the 15 Member States of the EU undertook to comply with an 8% reduction.
The commitment of Hungary is decreasing with a 6% emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect in relation to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country - senala complied with the press release from the Ministry of the environment.
A great deal is at stake in balí, since in two anos we must sign the international agreement of climate policy in the long term, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be deferred for after 2012, in this case the reduction commitments made at the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system of reducing emissions, the need for which was perceived in its most recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
In this way, the reduction in emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of over 2o C of the average temperature of the earth, which according to the scientists have immense and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruited in youtube
The British army units in a dealer to publish filmed recordings videos on actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularise themselves.
First, the British air force (RAD) was that took advantage of youtube services: special units in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are applied videos on its actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made with mini montadas cameras on the helmets enforced in the body of operations of Kandahar, then it is sent to London to be levied by the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
They are already 139 recordings soldiers from the air force which have been charged in this way by the Internet and "channel" has been seen by more than 75 000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence recorded in spring 2007, under the name of 'defence headquarters' and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the meantime, the Ministry of the Community of Nations British Commonwealth Office) (as the multinational forces in Iraq (mnfi) have their own youtube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally had full air force the videos with objectives of recruitment, but in view of the Ministry of Defence serve also to show the public the real objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
Such propaganda virtually costs nothing in comparison to the conventional television spots of recruitment - has declared to the BBC the expert in defence Gordon mackenzie - on the other hand, inevitably have some political message since, in a specific way justify the raison d'être of the military action decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a videojuego
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recordings recelosamente published and abrogated in the distributor were also amateur videos, for example on the death of the soldiers: in the film 'official propaganda', a little hypocritical, officers speak a maximum of losses, without presenting however the bloody of fighting.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been charged by the Internet because many videos engraved in real operations, but the British army only recently is taking this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly differently to the recruitment to the free of charge descargables video games of fire so-called America's army, in which, in the middle of a situation more or less real player can be directly instead of soldiers.
And pastelillo raffle salado in the Christmas party ministries

The festival navidena will have a budget of EUR 2 500 huf by invited - of this budget will be paid out the receipt with Buffet and wishful thinking.
Since jános veres is the Minister, workers in the mf every anos held in the same way the Christmas.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official nature will not only for the ministerial speeches, but also by the time of the evening it takes place.

These then held every anos, begin with a short speech I welcome the Minister and concludes with a modest food.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and education and culture does not take place no Christmas party - that is what I was told the corresponding departments of the press to [origo].
In the department of the press of the environmental portfolio were not able to report on the budget for the celebrations navidenas from the Ministry.
What we know is that the party that will be held in the museum of the arts applied was invited to more than four hundred people.
They are meeting the forces of the strike giant
The trade unions and the National Federation of working committees will constitute the Friday a committee to strike to coordinate the strike on Monday which will continue indefinitely.
On Saturday there will be a meeting of protest, while that on Monday - day when we will have the final vote on the law on public health - will begin by unemployment.
Surely this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since they will be completely rail transport until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the company of public transport in Budapest.
On Friday afternoon trade unions to inform League on the details of their strike on Monday that take place in conjunction with the National Federation of working committees.
The Commission will also be to strike of the League and the National Union of train drivers will coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday there will be a meeting of protest, on Monday the unions participants will decide on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - not reported on the date of the end of the strike started.
If the national assembly disapproves of the law on public health, the trade unions remove immediately its call to strike.
On the other hand, if it is adopted, will meet the committees to strike and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda on Monday of the National Assembly is also possible that only vote on the law on public health in the hours of night very tickets, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike beginning on Monday, we will have to reckon with significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will work indefinitely, for the manana can to stop a part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the bus inter-city transport of the cross-subsidizing volán.
At the same time, in many parts of the country will have closure of half of the ways of the roads.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have joined the strike, their names have been constantly updated on the website of the league.
Some trade unions announced its strike indefinitely, others for time defined.
Until Thursday afternoon the state railways and the free trade union of railway workers (sltf) could not reach agreement even on the minimum services, although with the Christmas festivities, more and more people travelling on trains.
According to information received up to now, since the start of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the company of public transport in Budapest, those of Budapest airport since 7 p.m. until 9.00 manana, held a strike four hours trade unions of the League of the electricity industry and thermal energy, trade unions educators called a strike of 2 and the democratic Union educators of 2 to 8 p.m.
The Hungarian Association of doctors will vote in national strike in alternative hours and democratic Union of workers in the sector of health and social) (sdtsss forming part of the trade union Cooperation Forum, held a warning two hours.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the Government withdraw its proposal on the reform of public health and put a new concept for a social dialogue.
The second demand is that gradually introduced the new form of calculating pensions which will enter into force next Ano.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, in the case of pensions advanced the possibility of occupations that deserve can enter the system.
The fourth reason of the strike is that the free trade union of railway workers (sltf), which is part of the trade unions in league, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and transport on the railway roadside and expect a different proposal.
Political capital: in the country increases the risk by the Hungarian
According to the division of risk analysis (risk analysing division) of the capital of the activity of the Hungarian guard, constituted in August of this Ano with the support of the movement for a better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning about risks of companía it says: in connection with the operation of the Hungarian guard the greatest political risk is the fact that" with the escalation of ethnic tensions that exist between the Roma population and not in Hungary, even in the short term will occur raging ethnic conflicts ".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard is probably the provocation of an historic nature of this conference, the representative of the Institute of research.
Said that all this is due to one of the major failures of the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life I gave in the public debate on the Roma problem to the representatives of the political groupings radical extremists, who were able to explain its policy strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarian".
This makes the problem, prevents any normal dialogue, strengthens the extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - estimates.
In addition to that, according to the Institute for research, the activities of the national guard, as a result of the great attention to the average national and international, "deterioró significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country.
They remind us that: from otono 2006 received an ever greater publicity and boost the reorganisation of the radical groups and extreme right in Hungary and that since the summer 2007 were set up in the country numerous organisations autodefinen 'associations of self-defence national ".
'a common feature of these groups is that it autodefinen as civil organisations, while openly proclaim the training of its members to self-defence armed even - (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), with reference to the own inadequacies of the police, the army, that is to say the State "- add.
Said: all of this takes place in accordance with the method which seeks to give you a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with the policy and with political parties.
Therefore emphasise civilian and form of partnership in the case of these partnerships not only serves to prevent the legal problems of legal status, but at the same time, it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the neighbourly relations.
In recent months, in numerous neighbouring States touched upon the Hungarian guard and potential danger, while the political figures ultra-nacionalistas certain neighbouring countries, want to justify its own policy anti-húngara with the establishment of the Hungarian guard.
This has a bearing on the political stability of the region 'added.
According to the Institute for research, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that in the region as a whole were increased the political risks.
Wrote that the Hungarian guard works in such a way that for example the Bulgarian national guard, whose constitution was announced in the month of August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (unb) of the extreme right.
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard it because of the massive unrest of the Roma people, which took place in one of the slums in Sofia (krasna poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the unb decided to be vigilant, arguing that the objective of the organisation is "national themselves".
In its opinion in the last 17 anos was "Roma terror" in Bulgaria, however the state was powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the political capital.
Added: this initiative has led to an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public.
As is written, indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Roma organisations of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, form its own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian guard so far have shown similarities with the Bulgarian national guard, it cannot be excluded that also the gypsies from Hungary will react to the threat in a similar way, by organising their own self-defence - can be read about in the warning about the risks of political capital.
The Director of investigations of political capital, Attila juhász to the question of the news agency said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Institute of research.
As you said, every Ano published its risk analysis and when there is something that can influence the risk, to inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The Party are not always writes with red
In Hungary the law lays down precisely the days that they are written with red as the timetable and has already become a widespread practice that on the days of celebration - that the Ano ahead will be less - reorganise themselves working days.
Even in the EU or in America uniform are parties.
The Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday feast of state and solemn hours.
The solemn meetings essentially relate to religious anniversary festivities and historic.
The new womens Ano: both the last day of the Ano old, as the first day of the new Ano is celebrated - the latter above all to relax the spent festejando the Ano old.
Throughout the Ano we have eleven written Christmas with red on the timetable.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and 23 October, a day of commemoration of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we welcome the founding of the State, the 1o may the feast of work, the 1o 2o November and we would remind our relatives and friends who have died.
Moreover, in our country are two days Easter celebrations for resuscitation, Whit Sunday and Christmas.
According to the timetable, our national holidays, national or religious rarely coincide with a weekend, so often when there is a bridge before or after the festival there is a single working hours.
In return for the weekend alargados, over the previous Saturday we cannot leave the job or school.
Is the Minister of labour, which regulates in its specific decree when we must work to change or directly precedent hours after the festival.
This rule of law is meeting of compulsory for all employers and for their employees, as well as for employees and public servants.
It is not compulsory to instead for companies and institutions of services which, because of their work ceaselessly function, even during the solemn hours.
This Ano the order of work can be changed only day celebrations around the end of Ano: from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, because according to experience, most people 'bridge' during the meetings between the Christmas and the end of Ano or take their holidays during these days.
The Ano next several of our Christmas coincide with the middle or for the purposes of this week, so that there will be fewer changes in working hours that this Ano.
First we amend the agenda on the feast of work then, for four successive days, can rest workers.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working hours, so that in return on Friday, 2 may be solemn day.
The change is linked to the feast of 23 October, on Saturday 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the next Ano at the feast of order of Ano can rest, since from 24 December did not work in almost all, even if the last day of the Ano is a Wednesday.

If you want to lose interest to meet the expectations of the public
The car is moving ahead slowly in the usual backlog of manana.
It sounds a extrano radio: violin with electronic effects.
Subo volume.
The pace of change music and the previous overtones builds the low and then the voice of a chorus for women as a real gem.
The Channel mr2 song reproduces the wings of love of zagar.
National musical life not malcrió us a great deal with MAGP electronic quality.
But it seems quite different this backlog when you are listening to the new of zagar disc.
Appears yonderboi songs. Some new and interesting of national digital underground are gradually changing the image and once again, although it is fashionable to rock the garage, breaks guitarras style, electro national MAGPs has shown: there are developments under the sun.
Balázs zságer began his career in the city of pécs, fell to me in the whole of yonderboi until who started their independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of a single whole.
With its project (zagar) and their music, a mixture jazz, electronics and pop music bailable, tried to succeed, when asked soundtracks (PL cinema.
Ferenc török szezon).
The wider public became aware of the whole that originally acted just in clubs pequenos when the magazine wan2 disc identification of his first published in 2002 between the most important national discs, classifying zagar, together with yonderboi as almost the only national appointment of trends, capable of being sold in western markets.
There is no doubt that zagar and a whole are fashionable, but they have not been asked whether or not quite this label.
The whole reacted as must react, initiated a new record and even better.
The newly launched disc, entitled cannot walk fly instead can open up new paths for them, although the title itself seeks to establish the continuity with the initial anos in the town of pécs.
Because this title was one of the main lines of the whole former of Balázs zságer.
It is all very well the reference on the successful, on the flight, but in addition to the best of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitarra that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented the records in the millenáris György ligeti, the singer at present working in England with all the jigsaw.
In the records includes a real success of the Channel mr2 petõfi that recently transmitted from the manana into the night, this company was music to the ears of the radioyentes music of high flight from wings of love, set with six singing from Hungary (USD ivas underground ').
Because everything is in order (?).
Hvg.hu Balázs zságer asked.
Hvg.hu: after this new success the question arises which you are interpreting, to what extent is music to devoted in a targeted way?
Balázs zságer: the definition of targeted way for me it means little.
In my opinion, there are two types of castes in music slight; not mainstream and underground, not an alternative and MAGP, but trade and sincere.
The so-called alternative music groundwater can be tedious, without sense and can be composed equally only for sale, thus making commercial.
But also a good pop song could arise from an inspiration honest.
The behaviour of listeners works in this spirit, irrespective of languages and national borders.
Hvg.hu: you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the public Hungarian and abroad?
B. zs: abroad, especially to the west of us, music slight is larger traditions.
That is not only the generations of 15 or 20 anos attending the concerts, but also the older people.
They pay much more attention to the changes in their vicinity in music slight, because they believe it is part of the culture.
Hvg.hu: what role has the public in your work?
It is you who they are, where they are and how many are the people listening to your music?
B.zs: I am naturally good to see that more and more people attends our concerts.
But we have never made up music to the market.
The odd not music for one objective, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather sit in the concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the changes to grasp of the moment.
And yet, I realised that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
Hvg.hu: to what extent pretendes follow the example of yonderboi?
It works alone and made his career rather towards the West from us.
B.zs: we do not accept their way, despite the fact that sometimes try to compare our music with him.
We rather work as a team, we trust the musical presence on the other, and we leave it desenvuelva.
Initially, it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of yonderboi, as many of us we started our career in your group and hence we took another route.
Hvg.hu: in the list of successes of mr2 petõfi wings of love is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time on behalf of zagar in connection with this song.
Do abriste concientemente with this way towards a broader layer?
Zs.b.: we were not seeking to set up major successes and to sell our record these successes.
This song is something more than that.
At the end of the record to any great extent, trying to relax after the resounding orgy of records and the heavy.
Hvg.hu: how has chosen the six singing?
Why precisely to them - which was the main reason?
B.zs: the idea was to create a chorus à gospel.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of solistas good voice of our own national musical theatre.
This created this chorus of six women - in other words, kutzora edina seine, judie jay, bori péterfy, enikõ hodosi [neo] and juci németh - which was then christened divas of underground.
Hvg.hu compusiste: what exactly is the tune or girls have changed things?
Zs.b. song: this was a long time ago in instrumental version and when we have already had all the material record, we believe that there is still something.
The commensurate atraía Ode.
Even that night grabé the song which later the learned girls.
All came almost the first attempt and properly incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very much time, but of course also the divas needed.
With my voice had not worked so warmly.
Hvg.hu: both in the concert and records looks as if the girls were in second place.
There is no solistas (except the short only Judy jay), have no role of its own, speak for themselves all together and not more sharply than music, so that the music not only acompana their words.
Also on the scene belong in the fund.
Are intentionally?
B.zs: they are in fact simply because of technical problems.
On the other hand we do not deliberately distribute roles of solistas.
The tune is about this, on a short while ago that we forget our egos the who of what has been and where, let us therefore allow those wings, the wings of love we raise.
I had wanted to ensure that other felt that state of mind eufórico we feel when we began this song.
Hvg.hu: what dedicaste more work?
Zs.b.: in music composition in reality to any rather when it comes to spare was more difficult.
For example the dorian Gray's dilemma in that I am in playing a piano together or the rock 'n' roll goes to the girls, where for a long time I did not want to operate the groove and then gradually all began to its place as a jigsaw puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your favourite song in the disk again?
Zs.b.: this is constantly changing with concerts and because I have already "disc unleashed the".
Now the prophet is to fool the exhaust emissions from the earth and never the same.
A corridor traicionero stock exchange risk billions from their inferiority complex
A malversador unfair.
That is as its former employee, Jerome kerviel giant, the French Société Générale banker, also owner of a Czech trade.
He lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it appears, rather, that kerviel was a major player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, of course, with good capacities.
Intuyó some time, unlike all the big banks Czechs, the crisis in the market for American mortgages.
'has a fragile nature "was to hear the opinions of their superiors, those who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from the responses of kerviel contained in the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who, at the end of last year was a profit of more than EUR 1.6 billion thanks to their businesses.
Not only in America crisis
"what we wanted to do was to make money for my bank guarantees' in his answers.
In fact, in the summer, managed to win over the American crisis, 500 million.
This opportunity for the vió come at the beginning of the year.
In February we started to listen to any news on the so-called sub-prime mortgage offered to customers of low incomes or those who in the past had difficulty with payments and that those clients would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
We are not kerviel thought and argued correctly.
And then, at the end of the year their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
'when it gané my first 500 million I refer kerviel admitted as', and adds that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, stated that there were distorted the records in such a way that it was not a discovery.
You even went so far as to mislead the heads, even if the stock exchange eurex began to take an interest in their businesses.
The risk became benefit
Do I feared that were to find out?
Rather, they are not.
"I thought we had won 1.6 million for the Bank and the simple fact that they would be happy."
Where brought so much strength of willingness to take risks in this way?
In my opinion we should work gradually.
In Société Générale came to work in the year 2000, just after conclusion to study in Lyons.
Their pay annual manejaba between the 51 000 dollars.
Two years after it was assistant to row in stock market and in the year 2005 became corridor with a bag annual salary of 90 000 dollars.
Yet I knew that was never going to gain as much as any other.
In my first interview in the year 2005, because I noticed that I looked with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress "described kerviel researchers.
However, in the short time at my entry into the company was the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of EUR 500 million.
And this was a mechanism for grubbing-up, and wanted more.
If you want, you leave
This is a kind of "snowball" said the police.
But it is said that the heads knew of all of this, or rather the sospechaban.
'whilst money earned closed its eyes. "
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
Fridays a fully valid day lost billion.
After the weekend, in the middle of January wanted to remove all mark.
When the Monday came to work, because I was not in the Bank.
And after two dias, the Bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion for their own fault.
And how did localizarle?
This became suspect from their holiday.
I chose four dias "only for the past year.
The corridor, which does not holiday is a corridor, which does not want to which nobody takes a look at his dossier 'ended kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of 365 billion
The Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes that the Czech Republic can achieve 14 000 million (approximately 365 billion kronor).
It is practicamente half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain in Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven operational programmes will be approximately EUR 125 billion kronor in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around EUR 100 billion of enterprise and innovation programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The programme of transport is the largest of the operational programmes and represents a 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve the fund.
This money is increasing the budget for transport infrastructure state that next year will be the amount of 90.800 million kroner.
The programme of enterprise and innovation must serve to entrepreneurs and businesses to the acquisition of resources in innovation of business.
Companies should achieve funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of organisational methods more effective.
With regard to the actual use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least seized paises recien that use them.
Sentence of twenty years for the former President of Nicaragua, declared the Court
The court of appeal for Nicaragua declared on Thursday worth 20 years to the former President of the country which is, Arnoldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 by the desfalco 100 billion dollars (approximately SEK 1 800 million).
Despite this, a time following, was released from prison to finance house arrest in its not far from the Nicaraguan metrópili.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the PDB agency, the then head of state between 1197 violent and 2002, to be behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, ileana Pérez, will depend on rather prison officers if they fail to complete its German punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court showed a German constantly traspasaba money from the government to the account of a company in pánama.
This company was a fictitious and account belonged, in fact, their families and more cercanost supporters.
Part of this money ended in the German Fund created to finance their campaign in the elections in the year 2001.
We approved the budget
That is the case.
The budget of state was adopted.
Why is this particular budget?
It is the first produced by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year ’ s budget was adopted with the support of čssd, because we prepared the Minister and čssd sobotka might suggest not accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing happened dramatic.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view although more influential calmly, approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget line, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and so I devote special attention to them.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the mere numbers.
The national budgets of the past governments of the Social Democrats have suffered three flaws that for the year 2008 will not be resolved so facilmente:
The first of these is the high turnout of laws, known as compulsory expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that last year were adopted before the elections by the 'silent' coalition of čssd and ksčm.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit of public funding, as the budget deficit and local community.
In spite of this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the State.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, lies in municipal and budget deficit.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, in addition to the funds of taxes, charges and the appropriations for banks, often issued, pointless obligations to which basically disproportionately to their local authorities.
In recent years, managed to pay these debts by means of the massive sell-off of energy policy actions and other networks of development that received the state and privatisation.
We still do not have this resource.
Only if we stick to the facts officers and verified, we discover that:
Our economy, because a few years ago, will result in the stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which claims čssd.
This was the perfect opportunity for its government to put an order to state finances.
However, instead of the state endeudándose followed.
The rest of paises, apart from some countries such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or in Egypt, economizaron much more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations within the general measures, are less threatened by poverty.
That is why they are not necessary social mass programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years is inutilmente hincharon behemoths with measures.
And although managed to delete the part of the incomprehensible populist expenditure approved this year before the elections, if shortly does not change the retirement age and pension reform that will be the end of any policy in this country which is governed and who govern will only be a simple bureaucracy.
A tad exaggerated we can say that politicians who govern be transformed into mechanical pizza officials, the greater part of taxpayers' money to retirement and social benefits.
That is why, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but cannot stop the pressure from the normal expenditure of the costs of the leaders.
The planned deficits of more than 70 thousand million for the year 2008 would have been totally unnecessary if the last government had not wasted in the last ten years they could.
We do not want politicians who govern only turn into civil servants, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition government, that you realise that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining of taxes and charges, tranquillity for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will make the gradual achievement of a balanced budget for the state.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and the central banks, Swiss and Canadian British chose to fight together against the market crisis of finances.
In the monetary marking will be more than one hundred thousand million dollars by means of licitaciónes.
The process banks auctioned off the interest rate which are able to pay money.
For example, the American EDF will send to bid forty thousand million dollars, and after the other twenty-four thousand million will facilitate the central banks of Europe and of Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of various Member States agree on this process coordinated in order to protect and mitigate the consequences of the crisis of finances.
'This step must solve the biggest economic problem, namely the contínuo growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could provide "wrote in his report for clients, Bernard baumohl consultancy economic outlook group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks probably decreased recession in the United States for a 65% to fifty per cent 'continued baumohl in his report.
The banks have already spent 60 billion dollars in unpaid appropriations, particularly in the United States.
Economists ahead billions in losses.
"the central banks must really have fear of what awaits them even when decided to take this step" said the main ABN AMRO economist, kieran Davies.
'It appears that the situation is really bad' added.
The central banks fear that they will be given the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and would send the American economy in recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economóa.
The central banks so decided, after we have not managed to reduce the so-called libor London interbank tariff rate, which is used to the loan of money on the market system.
This means that the banks constantly was given money even when the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the autumn its interest rates several times.
'will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates' told Reuters news agency, Greg salvaggio Tempus consulting company.
Some economists never at which the step taken by the central banks will contribute to light the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the caida real estate sectors in the US.
Klaus: the debates of environmentalists are astounding
The climate change particularly affects the paises in development.
President Vaclav Klaus it again expressed with regard to the problem of global warming.
The criticism came now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where presented his book azúl paper, not planet, said that the debates of the ecologists, is incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference which creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organisations but the fundamental difference between the usual rhetoric and reality.
"further debates are structured, are hardly fireworks of words, a substitute for the solution to the current problems said" Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this subject is very important for him, and that is why we are interested in.
Also expressed your delight at seeing his book translated into German as' only said many times I meet the caricature of my ideas ".
Now the interested parties can obtain information about their varied views.
Klaus pointed out that it is not a climatólogo but which has, in his opinion, sufficient supposed to write a book as this.
Academic is able to follow and judge a specialised dissertation, has experience of statistics and is also an economist.
At the time of the closure expressed its thought that the climate is changing all the time and your changes are normal on global warming that there is an agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor are possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costosamente unacceptable.
As with the man experienced totalitarianism seen as unacceptable impose opinions not tried to others, that is as a dangerous way to restrict freedom of others.
The questions of the present repeatedly explained that is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against the environmental activists that do not take account of the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same subject spoke Klaus in Vienna two months ago in the institute Hayek.
600 thousand people have not achieved to change their driving licence
Six hundred thousand drivers are spent far and is therefore not reached to change its old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last dia when people can request the change to the officials of time until the end of the year in issuing the card again.
However, the Ministry not concerned that after the new year are on the roads hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid card.
According to trafficking, the grounds that they have not changed mainly those who no longer want to drive.
While in the peoples are announcing a rapid decline of change of cards, the offices of the metropolis estan full of applications and the interest in the new card has increased.
The city estimated around 2 000 customers a day.
In queues is expected by half an hour.
In Prague have not yet been taken around the new card of 140 000 drivers.
The issuing of a new harsh twenty dias card.
However, it is possible to ask for the delivery of the card in a shorter space of five dias.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred kroner.
Drivers must change their cards compulsory and not up to the end of the year, but will the roads without valid card will jeopardise a fine from January onwards.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
The police cannot get the infringement of a reprimand.
If an administrative offence the fine will DKK 2 500.
According to the information before it could be a fine that person who will not be anywhere.
Presumably could pay up to 30 000 Danish kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for the inclusion of moderately fines of a Danish kroner, maximum.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel hanzelka fines do not threaten a thousand SEK anyone.

Polívka lost the Kingdom of Wallachia too
Bolek polívka lost the complaint about the Kingdom of Wallachia too.
According to the Court judge Ostrava provincial was the first to label used the Kingdom of Wallachia too but the project was created for many years by tomáš harabiš who has cooperated with the player.
It was not tabled polívka today at the hearing.
According to his lawyer the cause has probably not finished and client recourse.
"The case is that Mr harabiš and his team are undeserving of popular bolek polívka" said after the process, the lawyer of polívka.
For him, before the words kingdom of Wallachia too, everybody has been the image of actor and funny.
The same idea also has harabiš.
"We have been following us some ten years of work.
Quest for money and invention of activities' he said.
For him, the cause of the case is the money.
"after years I have noticed that the project is successful and which therefore could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work 'added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court the Kingdom of Wallachia too was used in its first by polívka television programme.
In 1993 was crowned with the radoslav brzobohatý player.
Then it was not back towards the creation of a kingdom fictional.
A few years later to harabiš would publish the passports of the Kingdom of Wallachia too.
On the basis of this comic origin was a business and a lucrative business which created after Kingdom harabiš society of Wallachia too.
In 1997, polívka agreed in the use of the name and signing in passports and even offered their holders discounts the vistantes for their farms and assistants their sideshows.
Who will be coming to the throne?
The judge today also established that harabiš only used a simple idea that polívka issued on the scene for their own benefit.
It is clear that bolek polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia too "said the judge.
He went on to say, however, that in the spirit of the project is harabiš and his team which were used for this completely.
The cooperation between the parties today descompuestas, continued until the year 2000 when harabiš organised for the crowning glory polívka official vsetín.
Since then began to be conflicts between polívka harabiš and whose culmination came with the overthrow of the King Boleslav 'I, the elected by ".
The main role in the Kingdom, through harabiš resulted in the singer jarmila šuláková, as Queen Mother.
In 2002, polívka presented an accusation against harabiš and its society which has so far been rejected by the Court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the for the throne with their princesas, which is already preparing harabiš.
It should go out the new King.
You did not want to unveil even more data and dates.
'There is no hurry.
It should be something like the path of King towards Moravia.
The King should be elected by a specific date.
Even Mr polívka can be added harabiš ".
Test Peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti prejudices reversed:
To tell the truth, I have never liked much peugeotu 206.
Their characteristics of motion were never very much, the quality of the changes, and also the product could be characterised as below the average.
But there is now in the market his successor, Peugeot 207 - and this is much better.
This combi so-called sw is a little more advanced and to me, because I can only pensármelo better.
When the classic probé Peugeot 207 five doors, complained to me, for example, the area of the head in the back seat.
This, however, would be the only complaint because the bodywork of combi means in this respect, I am not going to suffer in the two metres in length.
Flying in the world
Step by the Interior very quickly in order not to repeat this too.
This is an elegant design where the only failing is the poor central tunnel.
Here more consideration to the design invention, even if the car seems rather elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when the opposition of short seats and support across the political spectrum.
Also unlike 206 model, the management side has improved considerably.
And the area - and here we can understand how they have grown up the measures of the bodywork.
In the combi disappears this lack of space in the head.
The boot suitcases
But the most important thing in this vehicle is its boot.
This I have evaluated as highly accessible (through the back portón flexible so that it can fold) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces estan equipped with driving Goma that pose an ideal solution.
Not a nuisance, and can be extended to the point of restrain objects.
Let us remember, in the tank.
According to the tables, basic regime has a capacity for 428 litres in comparison with competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type more sold in the Czech Republic, the škoda fabia combi.
If we compare the 207 sw with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, found that the Peugeot falls in line with their perceptible 52 litres.
On holiday abroad or in placing the buggy of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to say something positive, I must mention the floor after that there is some level to overthrow the second line of support across the political spectrum.
120 horses marches in four
Our tested car was equipped with an injection encedido four floodgates on a capacity for 1.6 L. and strength of 88 KW.
To tell the truth, and that is how it should appear a 1600 that menospreciara family to five doors.
It is silent, consumed, and above all, it has little momentum.
If I compare this with the era of škoda then it looked as if the exhaust pipe was taponado by an attack, I can say that with this can be impressed.
Prices are
The price of cars not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested elegantly and a vehicle equipped with a motor very good.
The basic price of car with lighting of injection of 1400 kroner by 329.900, it can still be.
Our aggregates make it from 410.900 Crowns which is already too.
Already at the rate premium tested other 80 000 Danish kroner.
Only that tendriamos airbag still in the headwaters, air conditioning automatic, automatic limpiaparabrisas windows automated traseras...
That is to say, the car with all all costs SEK 531.900.
It is a great deal, but complements to equip itself with the team in fabia and come to a fairly similar.
Only now is to decide which of the two brands.
Students Slovaks do not constitute the English schools
In the English schools are children of paises from Eastern Europe and therefore, local inhabitants fear further changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only entail a number of problems.
Even British schools recorded cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated in the town north of Kent where are beginning to grow conflicts between the natives and migrants Slovaks.
Discussions, estorsión and broncas between students have already reached even parents themselves.
The situation has gone as far as police arrested chatmam Slovak a woman who was to undo sticks to a student ten years with a Green yardstick.
In its defence said that the child was abused her son with insults in tone racist.
The police had to act even after an attack of two girls minors against a Slovak emigrant.
Girls I agasajaron with racist abuse and strove stones.
'when we were going home, a lad moved closer to us from the bus and began to escupirnos.
When I told us that we should stop the attempt to engage apples and pears, and then be dropped the trousers and showed us back its "described another unpleasant incident in order to the times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even appointed to the conflict with immigrants from Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases mentioned earlier, show us as the environment in the English schools is beginning to be fairly tense.
In Britain we have registered 70 Slovaks who came here to work.
An estimated 30 000 students Slovaks attending schools in that country.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that would expect their holiday can be met, provided that eliga correctly.
Arenosas beaches and gold, large waves or a calm sea as a pond.
The palm trees and all including with offering pizzas waiters at the seaside, at a standstill or varied cocteles.
Kitesurfing roulette, Golf and.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea can find all this and much more.
Only in an island is still much more and that island is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful of all the islands of the great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba to become the bastion of the conquest of America.
He called this Columbus, place more beautiful that human eye has seen.
Havana became warehouse and port of burden of the treasures we Spaniards extrajeron of America and led to Europe.
And then came the era of the Americans.
The national hotel grew at the end of the Twenties.
I sent to build one of the leaders of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that needs of crime in the USA (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Between your visitors were, among other
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana arose buildings, roads were high big cars which were a symbol of the 50 years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway finances were bought in San Francisco de Paula, around Havana and cojimar took its yacht.
On the walls of the left bodeguita their signatures the stars of the entertainment industry and politicians in the whole of America.
And today?
On the walls of the bodeguita habanense you can make your autógrafo.
At the bar of the expensive national hotel the coctel according to their wishes.
These cars and of religion in the 1950s until today still operate in Havana, because those lada and Fiat came a long time ago that have been corroded and between these humid salty winds.
Even if Havana, in particular the former is deteriorating dramatically, does not exist in the vicinity so many wonderful colonial monuments as elsewhere.
Elsewhere metamorfosean in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings both money, its development is guaranteed.
Over the past fifteen years grew new hotels not only in Havana but also in varadero, on the coast of the province of holguín and islet as Coco period period, William and others.
Cuba is still a curious that it is in the world only and that is highly valued by lovers of the railways.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense planting up to sugar plants for vias close in steam engines or stations.
A garage is completely harmless by tens of years cannot be discovered and are now there, machines that are working and whose models brothers in other parts of the world are only in museums.
Where do go?
The place better known to most of the vistantes does not change.
And so there is no need to talk of Havana or varadero.
Perhaps, only point out that in the aforementioned Hemingway finance there is a museum for those that are admirers of writer, must not fail to see him.
The Valle d viñales is the best corner of Cuba in the west of the island.
Vegetation exuberant growing rock chalk on land.
Mogotes, rock pilones chalk and rocks of high escarpados caidas in the valley, and in its grutas aclimatan is fertile land which are behind roquedales dense vegetation.
This is the place where the valley is cultivated, probably, tobacco of higher quality in Cuba.
Visiting some of the factories of cigars habaneras can be found with the end product.
Perhaps someone appears interesting that there are tarmac the Chilean part of the number, the greatest Zeman.
Trinidad
Town of old abolengo which was founded not long after the Spanish colonizaran the island.
Slavery and sugar demanded the reputation and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers arrived later, in four hundred years has hardly changed.
Trinity, between the sea and the Sierra of escambray, is a place as paragraph that even in the 1950s of the last century was not the road to join with the rest of the country which is.
Such isolation the helped to remain outside the rest.
Nothing new was constructed and therefore, nor, nothing has been lost, because everyone was happy to have in which to live.
If one takes more time to be Trinidad that one afternoon, it is worth knowing places interesting in the vicinity as close to the beach in ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of music, which encourages with their music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
Small town in the Far East of Cuba, some consider it as the finest of the island.
With certainty that view it is confirmed by the way.
The two roads arriving apart from Guantanamo Bay must go through high and quebradas mountains, how a nature that hardly knows the action of the man.
This place East of Cuba has been included as a world heritage by UNESCO thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There are the best chocolate, in his church have Columbus cross (it is actually a cross reached 100 years later than landing) and since the hill, where the House and that there is now a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and including the best known, the anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra teacher, the Bay of Pigs and the island of pinos, Tropicana cabaret, patrona of Cuba, the Virgin on charity of copper, santería, African religion that provide the descendants of those slaves, all this could fill many pages.
However, as they say, better looked at any time.

This is to enable the population that they alone can begin economic development and security, said "BBC radio the Minister for Defence, des Browne.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the rebels Afghans according to information from the American army is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent action grew up in comparison with last year in a 27%, and in the province helmand up to 60%.
The pàises of NATO have in Afghanistan around 40 000 soldiers from the quarter are in the south of the country.
However, for the United States and the allies have reached the same line in terms of organisation and equipment of units.
They are asking for more precise helicopters, soldiers and training experts pra Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete targets for the future and the way in which we will achieve" said the gates.
In a similar today also said, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap of hoop.
'I am not happy to know that this is what we have on the land and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a 90% of soldiers and equipment that we need, and this is not 'said of Hoop to Reuters news agency in the closing of the meeting of three dias with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the paises assistants in recent months is the argument about whether all the allies are the highest in Afghanistan.
It was criticised by passive, for example, Germany.
"the Germans have in Afghanistan a number of reemplazos.
But they are at a minimum of violence and the need to fight there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country which is "said gates.
The tabloid newspaper sun, this week called vague to the German soldiers.
"the rebels Afghans are discovering that the Germans are devoted to play as long as our children are fighting 'wrote sun accompanied by a material photographs of German soldiers tennis from playing the Bureau.
The German Bildt responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops I played a rugby party in the southern part of Afghanistan.

Similarly we also sees the next finance economist, Vladimír pikora: "We could spend the billion during the year 2009.
Exactament when that will depend on the next budget which we do not know.
If we see that the situation in the political arena change and politicians were able to save, then we could delay the year 2010.
But I do not see that such a change 'added.
The question is growing

Likened today before a court to Khartoum to have given a name to a bear of peluche
The British teacher judged in Sudan to insult to Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of imprisonment and deportation, gave his lawyer.
The British was accused of failing to pupils of 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet on a bear of peluche when any representation of the prophet of Islam is inadmissible.
The death penalty was pasible whipped.
This teacher of British school age of 54 years according to the unity high school in Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at home and charged attack Islam and sedition, pursuant to Rule 125 of the Sudanese penal code, as a result of a number of complaints from parents of pupils with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
History is back in fact until September, when this teacher calls on their pupils, 6 / 7 years of age, choosing a name for the bearskin of peluche classmates.
"eight names out of the mouths of children, as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", the director of the school Robert boulos.
Finally, following a vote in kind, 20 children of each 23 have elegigo Mohamed as to name preferred.
Mohamed is of course the name of the prophet Muslim, but above all a name very common in Sudan.
Then the children have done a book for the kind with the photograph of the bear with the following labelled "my name is Mohamed".
The same bear him - had no label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of my colleagues Muslims Gillian Gibbons, a lecturer at the same school in Sudan, stated that I knew well and that would never have done something which can be insulting towards a religious faith, 'I am sorry but it has asked the children to vote for a name', he is just a 'honest mistake'.
Opinion divided by many pupils of the teacher of school which describe as' very attentive to their pupils' and 'which never talk of religion in class'.
We must remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name more given in Great Britain, he writes in English with 14 different ways.
This name often elegigo by Muslim families is one way of honouring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of the name?
We can for example give it to a plaything?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.

After liberal reforms in the 1990s, "poutine restored the model of a nanny state, fully accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a true economic confession", estimated María lipman, of the Carnegie Endowment.
Today the Russians want 'by their own personal responsibility "briefly who had shown following the outbreak of the USSR.
'Why reflect? "
The phenomenon up all social classes, including the World issues.
The administrative elite and does it intend to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (each 85 heads of Russian regions) at the local lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often sinónimas of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The prefers to stability.
On behalf of the Russians will not vote nor by extremists.
Conclusion Tamara tcherednitchenko, Professor age of 54 years: "Why do reflect?
Do those in power are not too bad, why changing them? "

Will there be rally of the end of the year on the stock exchange? experts, divided by the crisis' subprime '
Less than five weeks to dismiss the closure of the exercise, investors frotan hands already been waiting for the traditional rally of the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to take place.
Banif believes that 'statistically the December on the stock exchange tend to have a positive attitude.
We should not, however, make provision solely in the statistics, and even more so because in the current context, the uncertainties lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange grasps carrerilla in recent weeks of the year, these experts' point that the stock market it is claimed by the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly the bonds, affected by the fact leaps values of quality in the long and the short routes'.
I therefore believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behaviour, which was not devoid of volatility "above all that we do not know the impact of the likely decline in the rate of the EDF, given the high level of oil and the danger of boosting inflationary tensions'.
Javier neighbourhood, responsible for sales of bpi in Spain, coincides with that is not good time to venture to say that there is going to be rally.
"is not the thing for many joys', ensures the expert.
The ibex has lost nearly 4% from the highest marked on 8 November, when the rate closed in the 15.945,7 points.
As yet, not all the experts have this vision as negative.
John Solana, analysts of intermoney, believes that the ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that occur every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be something different this year because it believes that the rally is to bring forward the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analysts does not consider that the volatility will affect the development of the market.
For its part, Frederick olucha, analysts of inversis bank, values that we are close to technical standards and therefore we could see an extension of the rate which could be driven depending on the news arriving from the USA in terms of the impact of the crisis in the credit market '.
The analysts is confident that these are positive.
The analysts are agreed in selecting the values which will be responsible for the ibex towards new peak levels.
Solana, intermoney, says that 'this year falls to the great values'.
The expert would be included in the portfolio at the two big banks and building a "because, when it comes to date, the electricity sector will be very expensive '.
Meanwhile, Frederick olucha bank, inversis ensures that increases will come of the banking and the industrial sector.
Clients will also be able to benefit from this rally in case of itself.
For several months ACP 'recovering positions and we hope that other as ferrovial FCC construction and follow the same path ", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the season Christmas sales.
On the other hand, the expert who believes that the technological so will very good although in this case there is a great deal of representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a declining month.
The real rally of the end of the year we lived in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets out of the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which ibex regained 28,17 a 35%, December saw a resurgence of 6,68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year gains (at the moment, the ibex climb a 8,36% since January) and if it can count on your rally of the end of the year.

To this end, the modernise entity branches which they already have in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile to submit the clients of the various streets.
In this way, the extension of working time is accompanied by a different concept of the area of the branch and a new design, more up to date, with more luminosos colours.

The former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer by the President of the government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists will gain the general election.
This was announced in press conference the Secretary of the organisation of the PSOE, José white, and the very Bono, after the meeting to which he had this afternoon in the Federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the supply to the former Minister because 'it is important to have the best' in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he said 'yes' Manchego think that political will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists expire at the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress to Manuel Marín, issued on 15 November its decision not to stand in the forthcoming general elections and leave their career in the active policy to devote themselves to combat climate change at university level.
The former Minister has acknowledged that the President of the government has continued to insist that return to the forefront since the abandon two years ago.
It has also pointed out that, like the citizens know who will be the economic Vice-President if the PSOE wins elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in a 'act of transparency'.
If the post, bonus expected to turn the House in the home of respect and not of insult or the cry. "and" do that will increasingly resemble the citizens'.

Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change are hard-hearted persecution both predictions sceptical as to which they gain from other social and political battles, is obliged to show consistency of iron.
And more a leader of the movement that is President of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than from Islamic terrorism and until it is proposed to sign a new contract with the world ".
This approach requires it to explain why the action or inaction, your government have contributed decisively to Spain to lead the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, where it was produced and by what your government, the contract with the planet, it has avoided.
In addition, requires it to explain in the clearest terms to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits citizens must be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective obliged to do, what economic consequences will be.
In other words, who will go out of the window and who will pay to save the planet.
But nor has there been, nor will there be these explanations.
It is precisely because this is sacrificed and pay.
Measures to combat climate change, the real action are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the penny of petrol suggested by the PSOE thought so dangerous to their Zapatero which has hastened to deny it.
In other words, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with slogans devoid of any real result.
With shocking, committees, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, that Mr so valuable to election campaigns that neither speaks or statement or requesting exclusive, but meetings and inspires blows.
Provided that it is nothing more than a contracting party merely virtual and not to move us cycling or let us with the range.

The public prosecutor of the Balkans

Their names are on this list which takes its title the documentary by the Swiss realizador Marcel schüpbach, 'the list of Carla' (2006, at least not in Spain) that, with the pace of a police thriller, is the work of the prosecutor Switzerland in Belgrade to New York to prosecute criminals who flee and bring pressure to bear on the governments concerned to strengthen the siege.
What I am sure it is worth?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver of the potential disasters, represents a major expenditure that will depend on a number of factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, civilian status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Take the car is only the beginning.
And that is that, choose the right of car insurance is even more difficult to choose the type of vehicle.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This compromise takes the form of a contract of insurance, which states that the company receives the value of the premium agreed to change that will be responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, stating taking account of various factors such as age, sex, the age of the card, civilian status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies establish their prices on the basis of statistics, more likely to have an accident, larger share to pay.
It is for that reason that both the elderly of 25 as women have to pay a lower premiums, because statistics show that have a lower rate of accidents due to their care.
Furthermore, in stock, companies have come to the conclusion that the people who are married tend to have fewer accidents that drivers singles.
What it of the vehicle will influence the frequency and the likelihood of having any hitch.
The increasing frequency increase the chances.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when it comes to setting the price of the premium.
It is for that reason that the driver has to take a good look at the situation for choosing the sure car most suited to its profile.
Here we will make the most significant variables to choose one or other types of insurance, so that, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offered a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 years are faced with a number of disadvantages to take out insurance at an affordable price, as are the driving and limited experience in the age of the card.
Although the ideal to be well secured is a sure, there are other options are cheaper.
More cautious drivers can opt for any risk with a franchise, so that they can get the insurance cover to any risk but at a more workable.
This sort of agreement would mean that the customer a part of the amount of the disaster.
"The share of the cost of the sinister that provides the customer is preestablecerá depending on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the level ', specifies Luis Noguera, head in Spain of first Europe, insurance mediation online.
The other option is a safe third extended, so that the customer providing protection against damage caused to third parties, but not before the caused in their own car.
Furthermore, would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are under the age of 25 seeks to be careful and prevent accidents as much as possible, since this will have an impact on the payment, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the basis that the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this charge basis.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and profit from it.
If the company has had a good year can be allowed to increase premiums ", clarifies Noguera.
The last 25 years, drivers will be easier to take out insurance, given that the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is more sensible to recruit any risk with franchise.
Normally 'young people cannot make use of the experience already gained in use in an accident, and even in the' driving, ensures the director in Spain of the European company, which adds that most accidents occur in the second year of driving time now, a fear of the 'new'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children is preferable to negotiate a safe, provided that their economic situation makes it possible, of course.
For its part, married couples with children are considered by the insurance companies and the public with a lower rate of accidents, so that deposits will be lower.
In this case the best assurance would be one to any risk with franchise (which could be of EUR 300), or when they have been approved by a high level of bonus, one third extended from the third year of the life of the vehicle.
"are driving more relaxed and have the greatest purchasing power to afford to assume a greater number of franchise", according to Mr Noguera.
For retired people are opposed to any risk of insurance (and this threshold of EUR 150), or one third extended when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that the sure car is important, not only because it covers the driver to possible disasters, but also because it is a major expenditure, which is why it is essential to consider the sure that suits us in our personal situation.
The Celtic search in Milan a point that is the eighth
Milan and Celtic we measure this Tuesday in San siro in search of the point that they need to achieve their objectives in the closure of the liguilla champions of the '', as the Italians would serve to be first and Scots sentenced for their classification.

Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and tied the Giuseppe meazza seems to be the result more hoped, although the two teams will go for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that would gain first and would ensure better in eighth crossing.
The whole of Gordon strachan could serve even a defeat for the eligibility shakhtar if the winner is not, but they will not be left because equal nine points is the will to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other mourning direct.
Thus, the crucial milanistas amargarle night Scots, who rely on access for the second time in the eighth reestructurada Champions League and in succession, after they were precisely this round defeated in the last campaign with a goal in extending kaka (1-0) Following the 0-0 of the tickets.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the shakhtar to which it is only worth the triumph, in the case of losing the Celtic, both for their noses to follow eighth on UEFA.
And that is that the benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what, UEFA.

The growing dispute on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that the export of fuel to Western Europe on the part of Russia.
The majority of gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed via Ukraine, so each stood between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has noted that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of transit.
A dispute earlier last year by the supplies to the EU Member States.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came along with the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State, master monopólico gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that should pay Ukraine by Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that will be more to Ukraine, as it has undertaken to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
The analysts say that could be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important journeys for gas during talks "said the Chancellor of the Exchequer Anatoly kinakh to Ukrainian Reuters news agency.
"the changes in gas prices should not be attributed to our arguments on the levels in transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine '.
The last major dispute over gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas a quarter of the supply of the EU.
Russia is the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply of gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.

Climate of Venus gives an idea of the future of the earth
Women may have been once an appropriate place for life, stated yesterday scientists.
The data of a European manned spacecraft went into orbit showed the world more like a twin, the land of what had been previously.
It is the world's closest to the land.
The two planets have comparable size and occupy órbitas Venus similar but it is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago Venus, could have had conditions similar to those that made a habitable planet Earth, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the air erosion on solar radiation and solar rotation more slowly sent to women to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet is not water, the temperature of the land area is enough to derretir lead and it is being eroded by the winds huracanados X-ray and storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the express Venus, who has studied the planet for a year, provides a picture of how the earth could develop disastrous changes because of the climate.
Professor widely Taylor, the physical department of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission's express, says: "becomes clear why the climate in women is so different from the land, when they are two planets so similar.
Our new data "make it possible to build a scenario in which women started out as the earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago '.
Police decomisa 'enriched uranium "

Still remains open
Mitt romney says that it is disgraceful that the presidential candidates to answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
However, the Republican candidates for the Presidency possibly agree to hold a debate on youtube, where ordinary voters film in video questions and sent to its spread among the candidates.
None of the questions tabled on the afternoon of Wednesday 28 November were more ludicrous than the snow monkey democrats who asked about the global warming in the debate of the Republican Party of youtube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the State of the republican party in the run-up to the elections next year.
We do not know exactly how the producers of CNN co-patrocinan, that the debate, they have opted for the videos youtube to show the candidates for membership.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longest-running devoted to just one subject, as in immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful clichés for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of voters hesitant that subieran dial listen when the thoughts I agradaran: issuers notaron peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with arguments extremists.
Exchanges of words stricter night were between rudy Giuliani, the pioneer national, and Mr romney, which has been prominent in the crucial iowa polls and new Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of romney treat because it was illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
Mr romney attacked, accusing former governor of Massachusetts recruiting illegal immigrants to work at home.
Both responded aggressively when I was asked if any applicant could support a 'Amnesty' (allowing illegal immigrants to regularise their situation and dandoles the possibility of gaining citizenship).
The candidates children as Duncan hunter, Californian Congressman and Tom tancredo, a congressman of Colorado, succeeded in agreement with the subject.
Neither has the floor to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both blew the whistle on the subject of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with the fear of toys toxic China and other concerns on the outside, aid to the Republicans to forget, or minimise, divisions between the liberals and conservatives Christians.
But the debate was turned into embarrassed when there was some other issues.
To Mr guiliani he was asked why it had supported the control of arms in the past.
John McCain and Mr romney discussed whether plunging in water should be considered torture.
Someone asked whether the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr Giuliani to face towards the position that although the Bible was his book the favourite, did not believe literally in the history of the jonás and whale.
Someone asked whether Jesús would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee -, against all expectations, firstly in the most recent survey of iowa, thanks to its Christian conservatism long data- said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was under pressure to respond if Jesús would be in favour, the rió by saying that it was too clever to stand as a candidate in the elections.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in iowa coincidentemente campaigns, with the collection of funds from the liberal rum Paul, and its declarations of the heated debate on the Wednesday.
They have both come from the Fund, because both sides of the party does not reached agreement on the candidate most famous and traditional.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate Party supported the early and forcefully with a message winner on the greatness of America, satisfying to both sides of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in to go bust; but equally emerges
As the scandals politicians are still in England, this is not a particularly interesting.
Do not seem to have been sold influences, and nor is it a case of exhorbitantes accounts for hotels in Paris, or chupadas fingers extramaritales.
But it has been revealed that a rich man of business has disguised contributions to the party of the British Labour Government, from more than GBP 650 000 (USD 1.3 million), for almost four years using names false, and that the party do not denounced.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister dodged calling an election, car abused the British intelligence by declaring that the opinion polls encourage not in its decision, the hope was that provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as vince calbe, the Liberal Democrat with ingenuity is growing, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from being Stalin to be Mr bean.
The rescue of northern rock, a bank in problems, showed the weaknesses regulation and poverty trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the code of taxes has placed the business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authorities lost 25 million of personal data that has emerged from an administrative botched unimaginable.
A trio of generals removed opened a revolt in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military expenditure: be ministers of the armed forces is demanded, a use of the time.
It is now up to the many gifts of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Secretary of the Labour Party (and former) has already resigned.
All of this means that Mr Brown unequivocally move towards the end.
Governments can reach a turning point then who are unable to govern.
The people do not believe as politicians, but usualmente suspended its disbelief when a new batch take control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister is unable to improve things, that it remains a long time, this suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; the cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press search bad news; and the government is on the defensive and not approached.
On the one hand, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders cannot defend themselves on the grounds that is new.
Even if I wanted to renege on Tony Blair, it was your lieutenant higher.
The problems of Northern rock and registration of authority, are linked to decisions that brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even when it is not directly involved in the setbacks of blairish effective partners or 'for', the funding of political parties - the voters can assume that if it has.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As Mr bean, no one died, nor has been cheated directly.
And the remedy, although it is painful to what the trends of course of the brown Stalinists Bellona activist, always have promised: a reliable government and brutal.
The new political scandal of donation is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams donations, which compares with gifts of charity, says that they do not want public recognition for your benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision does not take it.
Laws against the anonymity of the great political taxpayer is clear and there is a clear right: the public have a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
. Mr Watt, who said that the agreement of the Bellona activist, Abraham, and this was not illegal, obviously face jon mendlesohn, head of raising funds which were asked on donations in October.
But Mr Brown until now is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half of work.
It has been quick to condemn his party to break the law, but it is difficult to discern in decision-making on a matter of family, a committee of inquiry into the matter -conducida, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been raped, it is a matter of the police.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr Brown, it has to do, and to find a permanent and independent head for the committee on standards in public life, it has had one for six months, and in addition to push for a genuine reform of the funding of political parties.
This will require an arduous task cooperative of labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation we have with the unions -amargas measures for a biased as Mr Brown.
But he has to face certain facts partisan.
The Conservatives are now a good level of support in the opinion polls; he has two years to make voters; and the only way we can persuade the victory is to act with a first-rate probity and sound competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of mortgages subprime is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there are blood in water, it is natural that the fins dorsales naden emotional comments.
Today that the American market of housing is in crisis, the predators have their eyes and placing on the market of the country of credit cards.
In goldman Sachs analysts estimate that the losses in credit cards can reach the 99 billion dollars if the crisis of mortgages subprime appropriations or other forms of consumption.
There are already signs of infection.
There is an increase in both the card charges and fees of crime, which measures the proportion of the balances that have not been covered or that are more than 30 days of delay respectively.
Hsbc announced last month that has taken 1.4 m office in their business of financing American consumers, partly because of the weakness of the providers of credit cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
Late payment and crime are at low levels.
According to moody ', a rating agency, the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained by the technical factors.
A change in the law of the American people (2005) gave rise to a dramatic fall in the applications of bankruptcy, which represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications, and thus of gloom) would be growing again, or can it be that the conditions for the providers were getting worse.
The industry also delivers sound levels of charges, which shows how much of their debts consumers pay every month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas.
Dennis moroney of towergroup signature, a researcher, predicted that the volumes of emissions by the year 2007 will be around 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between mortgages subprime and the market of credit cards certainly exists: consumers like load debts to credit cards now that the credit institutions are caducando.
But the issuers of credit card look far more the flow of liquid assets values, so that the falling prices accionan not necessarily a change in the creditor capacity of providers.
May even work to aventajar concerns issuers.
Incentives to consumers continue to mortgage amortizando falls if properties are less important than the value of the loan; as a result, the payment of the debt of the card is rising in the list of priorities.
The card issuers can also to respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that creditors of mortgage interest rates, changing or altering balances creditors.
That, in theory, should reduce the risk of a rapid retasación of assets.
"We are not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans, Gary perlin, head of the finances of capital one.
If a sudden infection of subprime on the market of credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a sustained reduction are much more realistic.
If prices are lower houses and contraction drive credit to America to recession, industry undoubtedly face a future more severe.
We must continue to monitor these fins dorsales.
British bankers convicted in case of Enron
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with the former head of the financial office of Enron, Andrew fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew were originally encountered innocent from seven posts of fraud by coludirse with fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 for profit at the expense of employees.
They were sent to opinion in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing werlein jr. U.S district, each was sentenced as colución guilty of fraud.
The three old place natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish Group at the Royal plc bank, became cause célèbre in Great Britain on the extradition procedures which lasted two years.

The accusation against the bankers - dobló "natwest three" - argues that came to the Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with fastow higher and his assistant, Michael kopper.
Natwest place has invested in a subsidiary of a society of Enron controlled by fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of fraud in Enron, which helped the spiral of descent into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the Bank full the interests of subsidiarity in zero, but the three British men knew that valorizaría bullish.
A company under the control of kopper bought the interest of bank of subsidiarity in USD 1 million dollars.
The bankers withdrawn from kopper 250, 000 dollars per interests in that company.
According to the accusation, represented fastow falsely to Enron, since the energy company would pay USD 20 billion to natwest place for their parts of subsidiarity.
But the 20 million were into the hands of bankers British, fastow and others.
The bankers claimed 7.3 million, while fastow kopper, and others were approximately 2.3 million, according to the accusation.

The trio of British was arrested after three months.
Fastow is serving a sentence of six years in prison federal Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay particularly 1 million dollars to live in the United States, while welcoming the trial.
Enron, one of the seven larger companies of a nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks on accounting, could not hide the debt of million or make it their business to successful fail.
The collapse did lose thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in values of market and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the Chief Executive, Jeffrey skilling defendants were commissioned the past years for their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a condemnation of over 24 years.
The condemnation of lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of heatstroke last year.

Surgery 'fudge' could be a cause of death in New Jersey
Was the day prior to action of thanks when Ronald livingston he looked through the window in the restaurant "a bit healthier 'and vió how an ambulance rose by white cod, Cape two doors later in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car from the patrolling of the police.
And then another.
Then I saw the ambulance "," said the Bellona, supervisor. Livingston restaurant, on that day Wednesday.
"that was when I learned that someone had died."
The authorities knew that women dead was Olga Arroyo, 41 years, an assistant of the director of the Department of the police in Newark.
Scientists are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by a plastic surgeon not authorised, which is not yet identified by the police, but who work in the home of 212 of the AV. West Scott.
The authorities still does not determine what caused the death of Mrs Arroyo, but the toxicological test, even if the results will not be available until a few weeks ago, which will help to resolve the mysterious death that is sorry to the ranks of the Newark senior police.
Mrs Arroyo had been accomplice of the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and your voice was familiar to many in the department.
She was "fair" working and persistent, says Mr McCarthy on stream telephone in an interview on Wednesday.

It would say ',' you are to be monitored with this or that, "said.
'it was always here when I was, and also when they are not.
It is embarrassing. "
It is to be hoped that it will cut the Federal Reserve Bank charges to lift the.
The action was moved on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected that the Federal Reserve calmara credit conditions with cuts in the rates of interest, which were raised with the comments of tranquillisers Vice-President of the European Central Bank in the United States.
The stock exchanges are aflojaron in London, New York and through Europe, after Donald kohn, number two of Ben bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that the hacedores of policies must be flexible and pragmatic "to respond to the continuing tension on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets as a means of increasing signs of pockets of credit, the Bellona activist, he said that the kohn troubled recent was' invested in part by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October ".
If persists the upward trend, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for business premises and, said kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital markets in the USA and in order to further cuts in the level of interest, to stabilise the conditions of credit.
The remarks also helped to defuse Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economy of the United States, as the sales of houses which at the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence was marked by a warning, bear stearns investment bank that cut off 650 jobs, which amounts to 4% of the total workforce, in an overall reduction of costs in order to compensate for the loss of their investments in sub-prime mortgages.
It is expected that only 20 these jobs come to London, where the bank employs 500 people.

In London, the FTSE 100 165.5 rose points, or 2.7%, the closure of 6.306.2, by adding more than GBP 39 billion to the value of the major companies in Britain.

Before, highlighted the re-emergence of the tension of credit in the markets after a strong demand in an auction of funds to three months of the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to commercial banks 4.7% in Europe, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to the actions of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds in the stock markets in London, tensionaron credit and rates of loans to three months' libor "between British banks, meant the greater since September, a 6.59%, after a constant increases from the 12 November.
England takes with the demands of owais Shah and ravi bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should affect No 6 by England in kandy this weekend, owais Shah or ravi bopara?
And neither is less important when the first evidence against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David graveney, the President of the selection in préstamo- with this title particular at least, is here to help Peter moores the coach, and to Mr Vaughan the captain, to decide; and also because the desk Hugh Morris, Director of the England, is beginning to fill of offers for national selector, and if not, in one part time.
The sixth not succeed in the place of beats will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport.
It is not easy to throw in what is a man at the top of their profession, while another was never going beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of fate of capacity.
Not only in the cricket the choice is difficult, because they require trials which always being subjective.
Is it the right time to be lifted bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he is?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, quote John edwards' or 'tubby banerjee brilliant, two young executives with good degrees and are familiar with the business, had to be promoted the equation: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what a good level for a player cricket, unless we give it the opportunity to sink or swim to this chance?
The figures naturally have a major influence on decisions, but that they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player cricket has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time taking a wicket and a bateador opportunities to achieve change the order if it wants to impact as a player one day.
But to catch the eye of the seleccionadores is more complicated.
There were many which improved the last season, for example, Mr Andersson, which is playing in the first test even if Stephen harmison states to fit and bowls such as wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 wickets first class in 33 careers for each one to win a place.
Chris tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high points and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or bopara at the Stade de asgiriya can be simply a matter of opinion.
The option can break down or make the career of a man, or could mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth batty played in each test and did so well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul collingwood, fighting to be established at the same time who went to become a major player, and despite a notable cent double against Australia in Australia, may yet be underestimated.
The likelihood is that graveney Vaughan moores, and, following a discussion in today's sitting at the Stade de asgiriya, will continue its instincts of conservation and favour the great experience of Shah by on the exhuberancia of young bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is its bright and valuable proof debut of principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class compared with only 6 bopara, who on 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes spin off against the Bowling.
But Shah made only ten racing in its two shifts in May West Indian against the test in lords, his home as the middlesex player, and that was an immediate rejection of the selectores when Vaughan called for their place for the next meeting, seemed to be taken of its batting some élan which in Bombay.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie of vivre in guys.
It is this condition is putting on anything in the field of cricket and its attitude was summed up as when volcó his vehicle in an exhibition for the sponsor of cars in England, Volkswagen.
Suffered injury of minor importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing I did was to draw their Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, your fellow Member of the team that was looking to the distance, to say: 'Do you are with excitement this?'.
Bopara is the best player, including its may slope to have effects on their time you bet which seem satisfacerlo because batea with confidence and skill.
Choose the right man is one thing, to choose the best time, another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
My preference would be to give bopara its opportunity, which does not mean to say that are Shah, as suggested in the leaves of tea, it is he who is here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work, and the fight against Al-Qaedaand
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to reach Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were not effective, without extensions of visa and who hoped that the city back on its feet.
Some even had returned to combat the militant led the outside their homes.
At the station of mansour of buses, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in a convoy official government made up of a dozen buses, terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan again in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after to kill many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-qubaisi Sunni, a doctor.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what has happened in Baghdad and that is safer now".
'They say that the army of mahdi ceased to kill people', States, referring to disarm the religious militant shiite cleric moqtada al-sadr, who ordered their troops a cessation momentáneo.
The atwani qassim Shiite, 38 years and a lecturer at the Sunni area of amariyah, came back with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime does not want the Iraqi people working in their country.
Its neighbours Shiites in amariyah I received a telephone call to say that a strong ally of USA helped to take refuge outside their home in the west of the capital, and the urgieron to return.
One of the newcomers Jordan was the leader of a Shiite Sunni tribe and who had been driven from their homes in sleikh North of Baghdad, for an attack of grenades, after which urged the citizens to rise up against either al-Qa'ida.
He had been to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends, I received and I said that they had started such a militia refuge in sleikh needed and that of my support and that of my colleagues'.
"I therefore back today ', declared sabaah alu obeidi, 62 years.
Many people said be attracted by the growing calm in the capital, since the US troops afianzaran "citizens' groups concerned, armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend its neighbourhoods.
But many have been declared by the visa ban and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1 (3) million Iraqis were set out in recent years.
Salaam al-samarrai, 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiled to nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shiite, asked the Syrian government impose restrictions on visas for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people felt that they had fled the country because of the sectarian cuadrillas of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving deal with visas to the Iraqi people, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni.
'I cannot believe in a government which supports the criminals who my home after the fire that I made'.
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of the Shiites and vice versa, by relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden influx of refugees will arise again tensions sectarian and begin the fight.
The small Saarland, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even is conspicuous by the international orientation of their higher education establishments.
And throughout the country, the sarlandeses only a lack of education.
Yesterday I explained by quincuagésima 'to an sarlandés not that we are not franseses "- that was the same Moto ironic on whether the tiniest federal State for its cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a major role to play in the education system of Saarland that a study of the Institute of the German economy (iw) called "bildungsmonitor" held the fifth point.
In this way, the colleges by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was fundida in 1948 by the franseses.
Until now students can stop here university career with two or three dipolmas.
As a result, the percentage of nickel to foreign students is high, 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in the universities, but many of them are not a bacillerato.
"in the Saarland it takes advantage of the system of vocational education ', it says, the experte Axel plünnecke of education sector in the Institute of the German economy (iw).
More than five young people for their equivalents in vocational school, so that the Saarland points is 7% above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for an education profesional-académica is extensive.
The offer of careers double, with regard to the number of inhabitants, is the best in Germany.
Despite the practical occupational training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering science fell by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Saarland forced the universities to do more to advertise in science specialities engineering.
After the first PISA study made some reforms in schools of general education ", says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
So the Government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
To ensure that children start as soon as possible to look at the last year of the project called "kita-jahr ', it does not cost anything, while this model imitate other federal estades.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether there has been an increase in the performance of pupils.
According to the report sets foot in the year 2003, the number of students at school desminuyó behind in development of the 29% to 20%.
But, in general, the Saarland was not as other federal states.
In Bavaria, pupils know calculate better.
To upset the sarlandeses Pisa, the report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
Despite the fact that the sarlandeses are not French, the language of our neighbours is a problem to be compulsory in the secondary education institutes.
Chavez change the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another time huso different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez leaves amend the timetable in Colombia delaying the clock half an hour.
At present it is becoming less as a pretty in Spain.
As has informed the Official Journal of the Venezuelan Government, according to the new law, the time it will take at least four hours GMT.
In this way the Colombia will have a timetable huso does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things Chavez as an enemy of the United States, justifies its desición by saying that the United States would impose in its day, the obligation to the world to change a full hour.
In addition, the Wednesday local) (hour Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with its neighbour Colombia because of action with the taking of hostages.
The left-wing nationalism said that there would be no relation either to the Head of State or with the Colombian Government so that the Conservative Alvaro Uribe will continue to be the President of Colombia.
'My dignity does not permit me to do so, which is propulsando Chávez constitutional reform, in which citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendúm.
This reform could extend quite its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in that it was the release of the hostages.
The Sunday criticising Chavez said that the decision taken by Uribe offended Venezuela.
In Spain we talk a lot about Chavez.
A new tone of so-called cause feeling in the country: "Why do you not callas? ', is the sentence that have already unloaded half a million people.
This phrase gave the King of Spain which was perturbed by the continuing interrupcciones from populists left in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the reduction in real wage threat to the Germans.
According to a prognosis, this year a reduction in real wage threat to employees Germans despite strong economic climate.
The experts are a great many reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation Hans böckler, employees Germans should count in the year 2007 with a real cuenta-salario lower than in the previous year.
"the blame for this is the weak evolution of salaries, the increase of value added tax and estirón food prices and energy 'provided the newspaper' Gustav Bild Horn of macro-economics and research institute of economic cycles.
The new burdens of unemployment can be sure to employees.
The Finance Minister Peter setinbrück said to the newspaper 'Neue ostanbrücker Zeitung' that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the burden of 3.3% unemployment a move from one year to the next, it is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office should not be getting involved in an unacceptable situation, asking for loans and subsidies to the federal state, in the words of a politician of the German Social Democrat Party.
On Tuesday, it became public knowledge that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and derived from oil reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3%.
Women: twin brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, is the world's more like the land, something that has not hitherto been raised: the European down "Venus rays express' discovered in the atmosphere and remolinos in the Poles, the same that appear in winter on earth.
For the last three decades researchers had the suspicion that may be rays in women.
But now the probe has brought new evidence: discovered electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere, the rays of Venus cayen heights of 54 kilometres from a cloud and after another, account CRIS Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal 'nature.
According to the famous model of the origin of the lives of urey-miller rays, caused life on earth: the storms were able to have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, had given rise to the amino-acids that are the building blocks of life.
In women, this is not the case: if one day had living there, this should be one of the first states of development ', explains are Solomon of the institution Carnegie in Washington.
Today, in the area of women cannot be life: air pressure is almost 100 times greater than in the soil and surface temperatures reign of 500 ° C, ranging in such a way that they can be achieved temperatures.
'possibly' twin women is a diabolical ', but it is still a twin, "Russell said.
The main objective of the mission's' express "is to respond to the question of why women, so close to the land in their droves and size, has had an evolution so different.
And since the 1990s had not specific missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "venus-express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of women.
The final results of research that will be presented in many articles of ‘ nature, according to the opinion of researchers, underline not just the unity of women in the solar system.
'This desmuestra also that the planets neighbours have more characteristics in common with the land of which we had' reports, this.
Despite the already well-known stormy wind in the North Pole, researchers discovered polar region in the South also a vórtice formed by the clouds that turns faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the flows of wind in the high ground atmospheric sections of the Poles, according to reports a team of researchers by Giuseppe piccioni Italian Institute of special astrophysics and space physics.
The second world of the solar system is the mass almost equal to the land and Equatorial their diameter of 12 000 kilometres is almost as great.
This world also called Star of Alba or evening star orbita around the sun almost 50 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day when amounts to 243 Venus days on earth.
Although women with its surface temperatures 460 degrees and with its air pressure of 92 bars is not to the earth, scientists from the basis that both planets had been created in the same conditions.
In the two planets patchwork water was that the earth was on the oceans, but in women has cut itself off into the world.
While in the land carbon dioxide had become stones, in women form the majority of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the German Federal President insists on the end of the fight between the parties for receiving Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor.
He criticised indirectly to the German Social Democrat Party for his attacks on Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
The German Federal President Horst koehler, concerned about the reputation of Germany and that is why demanded that the grand coalition to end this fight for the receipt of the Dalai Lama.

Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in meteria of foreign policy, it stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the accusation that was given to carry out a new policy in China.
"the Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional way of the One China policy.
China also knows that, "said koehler.
Steinmeier frank-walter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democrat Party), had shown indirectly disapproval of the Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, criticised Steinmeier to the Union by its policy ineffective in the external field.
The Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellor was a lot of misunderstandings in relations chino-alemanas.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only withdrew the invitation to peer steinbrueck (Social Democrat Party), the Finance Minister in Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine 'Spiegel froze the so-called' strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese Government, called upon the Federal Chancellor Merkel ángela to recognise this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Stating the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and the Dalai Lama showed that is trying to divide the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble notes that there will be problems, such as those which occurred in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, fire, burning of cars, Wolfgang schaeuble warns that there will be trouble as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that we do everything possible so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany is to be applied on the streets.
There were barricades, hooligans guns fired by the police, after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs, Wolfgang schaeuble Party (Christian Democrat hit-and-run contributors Union) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We have to look at the social problems of our country does not take the form of violent".
'that we have to take seriously, "said in the newspaper' Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people work in the constant change social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and local authorities are already working with emphasis to resolve these problems, said schaeuble.
That relates not only to the integration of immigrants.
"of the Summit of integration to the Conference of Islam: all that is already beginning to bear fruit.
It is still early to assume the end of the alarm.
At the same time schaeuble indicated that the Germans do not have the same problems edificatorios sociological and as in France.
Young people conducted serious outbreaks of violence on the streets with the police to the north of Paris the last night.
In tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany called for greater efforts in the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, in a copier effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 years has been above the average.
We must ensure that there is a greater number of vocational training.
Kolat stresses: "We have to provide future prospects for young people '.
The President of the Turkish community added that in Germany but in France 'there is great social control in families', greater than the country French.
In addition, the majority of young people of foreign origin does not want to destroy what had built here their parents.
Kolat believes: 'but, in spite of everything, we have to be careful.
We need to "to enable young people to receive more quickly a job or vocational training '.
In the meantime the evening in the Parisian suburb villiers-le-bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter lights with it flew across the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as of rubbish and burnt-out cars.
Since the day before a team of almost 1 000 police officers is addressing security.
Having seen a suburb, Michelle alliot-marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take stringent measures until it is necessary.
Monday evening to Tuesday some 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in villiers-le-bel.
The riots continued the next night at tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, which killed two young people.
According to information provided by the public prosecutor's office, the death of young people was not because of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content came to your last point and that we must not expect nothing else from it.
But in what country has been living Chancellor?
After its desperate actions, indifferent and without much content in the general debate on the Lower House we must say: it does not live in the country which would have to be governed by it.
With regard to the reproach made repeatedly by have been used in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presuntuosa sentence.
He said that this would be a truly provincial way and that was made to see that it does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Dutch Lower Chamber was very clearly expresses all that this accusation was appropriate.
There was not a trace interest, nor any type of feeling for the country ’ s problems.
But instead, ángela wolke was presented in this way: a policy which is very high in foreign policy and is there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: much praised itself by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these goals here in matters of climate.
In general, this way of alabarse its - two years ago the leader of the Party of the Union demócratocristiana it has not been possible to allow such modesty.
It insists on expressions that a boost to the people.
And in this way damages its public image for the pragmatic approach which solves problems and does not go by the Bush.
But in the Kingdom of ángela wolke aparencias internal problems are of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns for workers with low salaries?
It is only possible to talk about this issue using prayers subordinated.
It is astonishing how many times, it is wrong to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a phrase more or less good.
It is beginning to cause 'as if it had been in unknown territory', when it was a question of more concrete information.
The section attacks.
The two favourite Giuliani, rudy and mitt romney, did a confrontation in a heated debate of youtube presidential pre-candidate Republicans and now they must fear just a candidate from the outside.
Right from the beginning there are signs of tension between the candidates.
Mitt romney reprochó his adversary rudy Giuliani that it would have been to New York in 'a place of refuge for illegal immigrants'.
This, for its part, responded with serious criticisms: "I would like to say that your own House was a" Port "for illegal immigrants' Giuliani explained to ex-governador of massachustes by saying that he it was who used to illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: as the group of Republicans does not have a clear favourites, eight presidential pre-candidate exploit the debate on CNN, above all to discredit their opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, rodados usarios on the Internet which were sent to youtube, nor have much content.
'with this kind of isolation, we come to power Hitler', that was the accusation of John McCain his adversary rum Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney receives much criticism from the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to acknowledge as torture 'waterboarding ", a method of interrogation, to allow for a person to choke the pretence of his death.
The reactions of the public in the Chamber in St. Petersberg missions in Florida show that in the meantime the most important issues of the campaign are further, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always welcomed very strong when alababan conservativos values and they denied higher taxes.
So you can see better where are the weaknesses of both favourites.
In that time I got it wrong ", explains romney compungido and calls apologise to the people and the public television for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf governs without more uniform.
A day after its resignation as head of the army, the President of Pakistan was sworn as President.
We have just eight years of the military regime in Pakistan.
On Thursday pervez Musharraf, the President of Pakistan, took juramiento a second term in office for five years.
The Pakistani television forwarded directly in the ceremony in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf was respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday has altered its mandate of army chief its confidente ashfaq kiyani and thereby accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the USA.
Eight years after it was written with power through a military coup bloodless, the former rules for the first time the state as head.
With his position as head of the armed forces, General Musharraf was a main condition of the opposition and the West.
The second requirement is the end of a state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to malik Muhammad qayyum, the Attorney-General, after the juramiento Musharraf is going to cancel very soon the state of emergency and the second condition in the West.
Since it was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there were many lawyers in favour of Musharraf. Last week, the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the controversial new elections the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy watiristán in the region of the North, five soldiers were killed and another four were wounded.
According to information from the spokesperson of the army a bomb exploded in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
They are the founders of krautrock.
The most famous German band of the 1970s is its activity: three Members' harmonia "participated in the concert in Berlin.
As reestreno was a copy of 'live 1974 "which was written in the best time of the gang.
Even at that time were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has in front of their cajita yes, its cable and above all their buttons.
In the natural sits Dieter moebius with 63 years and is dressed with a white shirt.
The Left is Michael rother 57 years, which has its lap-top computer and guitarra.
The right, looking at the audience is hans-joachim rodelius, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the panel of controls.
Each contributing to their sounds, among them are even pace.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This does not seem to upsets the gentlemen.
A very exciting to enthusiasts of krautrock was the fact that the gang harmonia returned to music.
What we have to disclose here is as follows: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the gang retumbaba in the minds of the people, but it was not such a special for 32 years after the public extrañase both.
But why Germans cannot also applaud her story in the 1970s?
Above all because the misunderstanding kautrock has always been more useful in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the industry of entertainment awarded a prize of music "ECHO 'Members of the gang can 2003 at Cologne on his work of life, in the Chamber you could see the faces surprised of artists in MAGP Germans.
And when network hot chili peppers agradecía to bandwidth and neu the Düsseldorf, all opened with astonishment.
Later Michael rother the time spent on stage during the concerts of network hot chili peppers as if it were an old friend (of the gang).
Ignorance at home and abroad, are one thing.
It is a problem to remind this band, because the trio only existed two years and at that time I fail to a great effect on the public, however, received it later thanks to the other.
There has already been a time moebius roedelius music and had done with the artist Conrad schnitzler and had a name, bombs which promised much reputation.
The principle tocaban in the basement of Berliner schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, worked with a music company in duesseldorf which was patronizada by a church.
For some time, had a trabajillo rother in kraftwerk and then worked guitarrista band neu! managed to improve the reputation of this German group in those days it was too radical.
In 1973 rother followed the musicians of bombs in exile to forst in weserbergland.
There, in alten weserdorf, which is a ruin the sixteenth century, living as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological that I, where roedelius comune could complain of their position.
That was more a life of artist full of surprises.
As they say, a day a cosy compact of association of harmonia of ottenstein in the rubbish, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name harmonia.
The first albúm we called 'musik von harmonia "and the second" lux ".
Despite the music was clear and simple, the gang took financial problems.
Life as artist was not only for known to itself.
The CDs' live 1974 'was recorded in the concert in griessem. Someone recalls that participated in this recording almost 50 people.
Then rother expressed its desire to March harmonia and do from time to time trials.
For roedelius and moebius this requirement is against the customs.
In 1975 the gang expressing their separation.
Rother ended in issues of esoterismo and secured its existence with álbumes as "flammende Herzen".
Revivió bombs the 1980s and since that time has had more success than they had harmonia.
The direct recording of albúm in griessmer, that we should thank groenemeyer.
Their music company grienland was an objective contribution to cultivate this German itself to preserve it like music alive.
As the work of roedelius, also the gang neu! was once again exposed.
The presentation of harmonia as gang takes place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
The gang was funded with public wordtronics festival.
There is Julian cope, English, the old punk and the author of the manual 'krautrock sampler ".
There is also present Dr motte, the inventor of loveparade.
In this way, all the influence of krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a súper-banda, as he was in a vacuum.
The phrase by Brian eno hand-in-hand with special music fills the Chamber: "this music is the only music some, she partenece the fúturo".
There are photos which contain harmonia with producers in a building.
The history of the development of the story is in the projections of photographs in black and white, where are instruments with wires.
Basically, there are three veterans that began to improvise again.
Do nothing more than to set the microphones body and the battery in order to produce some extraordinary language with the help of the equipment of effects that was built with their own hands.
The electronic music is as well as it should.
Three people who increase the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the leadership of barbaric morgenstern, in a musical environment is coughs, susurra and a good time of emphasis is sings "aaaaaaaah!".
Already krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
It is not the origin of gender into the blues but in schools of music (can), in technologies (kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic conventions and social) (bombs.
Here who cried '68!' is also right, but now harmonia retains the calm.
In the scenario is very well on what is already clear.
Where begins and ends the music?
That can break one the nerves or give you a quick time of luck.
Richard gere only lacks most cynicism.
The two films' the hunting party "and" moerderischer Frieden "used again in the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not so much conviction.
Or the concepts lays down a great deal in actions and tirotes or the two films are demasiando exciting.
Richard gere with its' the hunting 'either party can help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, are hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the dark inside the country during the war in Bosnia, was discovered the Richard gere player.
Finally we had lost people more guapo view of the 1980s, because nobody wanted to look after their roles unpleasant and of little significance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard gere is the most important argument to see the film 'The hunting party- when a hunter becomes the purport of "(why today the titles of films have to be so long and mad?).
The film is a wonderful presentation to see: in essence, its role in the reporter war is the presentation of what could do Richard gere, if the fate and the film industry had not been so misericordiosos with him, he was a man whose times better lives have been lost, that as a monument to the ruin of its decline committed to date most of his charm.
'The hunting party ", despite this triumph, together with" moerderischer Frieden "which is German and will also be tabled this week, prove to be just a series of films without success on the war in the Balkans.
The film 'can be narrar moerderischer Frieden "in short: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol Max riemelt) who want to save a Serbia the francotiradores of Kosovo, one of them is very quickly and it also leads to enamore it.
The purpose of the film is lost by the actions and fire, although we are delighted that the Serbs are not put forward once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German certain "alarm all 11 motorway is', but in a state of war.
In the case of "the hunting party" can be investigated, because in reality it was never a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and with other author of indent (Richard shepard in two positions), history on reporters Americans in war that is going to detect a Serbian war criminal so-called "Fox ', probably could be a new' Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are remarkably similar: the small equipment are twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot make the army and it is becoming a trip on madness.
One reason for the failure of the hunting party 'is when the start before us Simon hunt, he who cannot simply be a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides for a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnia that are going to kill then.
Then the hunting party 'is far from the truth, especially when, in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive quickly achieved what were not able to achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the heads of the world, which was catching the war criminal and leave them to the Bosnians musulmanos to vengaran on a fair basis.
It is so badly, who want to appeal to the International Court in The Hague based on the crimenes against logica cinematica.
However, incidentally, of the film is indeed one profondamente human.
The pelicula wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić esten even free, and emphasises that the Americans and the French estan not really worried pursuing them, because they political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that we have in mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma it is a mask of a devil Asia: "in the case of his brow gandes effect see it, by sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad '.
In films as' the hunting party 'there are also these scourges but they show that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only to the gender of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published all films produced in Hollywood on Iraq are fiascos.
We can also add that there has never been a good film on southern Africa.
It is almost always a rule: when a star goes for a region of crisis or by minefields, then something like 'Rangoon have recently with Patricia arguette "," across all borders with Angelina jolie' or 'diamonds sangrientes' with Leonardo dicaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts have occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least Hollywood ruede decades until a good film on the Holocaust taking as an example the film 'the list of Schindler ".
Certain films we need more time, the traditional as works on the war in Vietnam 'the deer hunter "," Apocalypse Now' or 'full jackett metal' in his time were not concluded by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Today we are perhaps too much on world conflicts, and so our times every slaughter (massenmord) has tabled directly in two television at home.
And that is because the authors of notes are not the slightest bit timid (that is necessary in order to) in narrar good stories.
"to be or not to be 'or' the great dictator" were to end as good, because lubitsch Chaplin and yet so bad knew that it was in fact the Nazi regime.
We might not be the right person to break a film.
Perhaps we need to be as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with their eyes and distant sarcastic of artists.
When I asked him about the parallels between its historical novel 'dictionary of lemprière "and the war in the Balkans, replied:" this is due to the fact that some things simply do not change there'.
The big cities decisions will be at risk, men are always going to be murdered cruelly and always war in Yugoslavia will reign.
Von beust receives in response the negative criticism on the Olympic Games.
The Mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economics not to apply for the Olympic Games of summer.
Many people want to continue to fight for competitions in section of water sports.
But beust recalls the need to be realistic when assessing the possibilities.
Hans-joerg schmidt-trenz, Director-General of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, said on Wednesday this resignation as "no good for the economic base '.
In the last time any other project in the large city motivation triggered such as the idea of the organisation of the Olympic Games.
"without this objective could not keep the political momentum, sport at the same level.
Schmidt-trenz Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new implementation in the long term that relates to another time '.
On Wednesday, the Mayor Ole von beust had his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Olympic Games of summer is not carried out until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but that is decided by the Federation of German Olympic sports', it says in the von beust Welt online.
Referred to the decision of the Federation of sport (sportbund) which is expected at the beginning of December, at the request of the Munich for the Olympic Games in the winter of 2028.
This means' preference for us that during this period of time, which up to now have until we 2028, from the point of view realistic we will not have any opportunity '.
In spite of everything, this dream could not forever, said von beust.
The Federation of sport in Hamburg (hsb) regrets the words of von beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to ask for the Olympic Games.
'It is too early to take the opportunity, if at this moment plans are ruined, "said the Wednesday Günter ploß, the director of hsb.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate of a reception in connection with the general meeting of the German public Federation of sport of higher education (adh).
There von beust nominated the request from Hamburg to universiadas 2015 not as' a substitute "of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport in schools appointed senior Hamburg as a candidate from the request.
The share of the German Social Democrat Party (spd-bürgerschaftsfraktion) reprochó the Senate which did not take advantage of the time as valuable for the construction of the homes in Hamburg.
'For many years the Senate was delaying with the development of small neighbourhood of grasbrook, because this was to plans for the Olympic Games and the construction of houses', said Carola veit and Jan quast, Members of the German Social Democrat Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded integrated planning of Olympia for small grasbrook and then the use of houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request from Hamburg to the Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 caused great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed due to Leipzig.
It is not the coffers of wood.
Anyone who likens the terms Sweden and box of wood, believes in Ikea, but not consider Andy warhol.
Or has it?
At present the coffers of wood produced in Sweden are as the shadow hanging over the list of works of warhol.
Most of the 1990s and four brillo-box 'type' of this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper 'expressen called "the doubt about the true brillo-boxes of 1968 of Andy warhol Museum, the modern Stockholm museet made internal investigations, and was disappointing conclusions: the six" brillo-boxes ", which the museum ex-director pontus Hulthén into modern museet museum, are false, and almost one hundred of the other" type Stockholm ", which are in circulation in the art market international, are too.
Prehistory is too complicated with an obscure relationship between the artistic production and patrocionadas.
In 1964 warhol created in New York their first "'boxes brillo-boxes ’ s depiction of timber, blue red and white, with the same shows that had cartons of washing powder" Europe ".
In accordance with warhol, in the explanatory their works 1968 in the modern museum museet were exposed hundreds of brillo-cajas of cardboard. These warhol did (due to the expenditure), but which were brought directly from the factory in cardboard "Europe".
It was not a question of works of art, but of copies (which were only a objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, warhol enabled us to produce in Sweden a brillo-cajas of timber, but they were not mentioned in the modern museet museum.
Witnesses of those days now talk about almost fifteen boxes, which at the time they joined the history of art and the auction original as "brillo-boxes' of 'type Stockholm' authorised by Andy warhol.
At auction some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that the director of the famous museum Hulthén pontus make false statements that in 1968 in Sweden was produced and exposed almost one hundred of the coffers of wood that warhol are made to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in that same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulthén and exposure in St Petersburg.
During this time warhol had already died for three years.
Lars byström, the head of the Conservatives in the modern museum museet investigated, six brillo-boxes museum property and three of the Swedish private property which were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. Imprimieron first esmerilaron and their platas serried and then are they painted the oil because it will do them with the pincel.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990 shows that paint was implemented with a steamroller directly without making the serried platas. Indeed this is not paint the oil because it will do them, but in the paint acrílica.
'these funds have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the list of official brillo-boxes Andy warhol ", Lars nittve says, the director of the modern museum museet and added that if the Commission of autentificación" Andy warhol rule' in New York will not come to any conclusion, the modern museum museet clasificará these six boxes copying as / objects of exposure.
Back in July the Commission of autentificación announced formally that accepts these "serious allegations" in this case of washing powder.
But since then there all remained silent.
