Schools are kept from bigger focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature pupils must handle at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyric poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 in the future.
Into the examination find also „unseen texts" Entry in order to stimulate to wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 pupils must take an independent GCSE-examination for language in the case of which choosing English literature as a separate qualification gives strong stimuli for that.
The education ministry will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first compartments to be reshaped radically.
Other nuclear compartments are changed next year.
In a separate initiative Ofqual, the inspectorate for examinations will give a re-organization of the GCSE-structures in a best known way, including a new marking system and less course work
In a speech in the summer education minister Michael Gove said that to „spread" it one „gives consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to reconstruct the public confidence" at what it stressed the GCSEs would become „provoking, ambitious and severe become.
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics - 116 hours per annum or three hours weekly per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand Australian schools teach on the average 143 hours annually and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Indeed no formal requirement will give to plan more time in the schedule for mathematics, however, from coalition circles it is said the comprehensive maths examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in ranking lists – will presumably encourage Schulen to scheduling more giving time to pay.
In the curriculum more attention to „Problems" is put „from the correct living", including financial mathematics.

These espionage-disclosures involved many proposals to new laws and guidelines which were aimed at the formerly concealed abuse of the public confidence.
The benefit for the society from these gained findings becomes increasingly clearer; simultaneously the accepted risks were reduced visibly.
Although the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government dissent still handles as a faith break and strives for that, political opinion comment to kriminalisieren and to charge.
Nevertheless: To express the truth is not a crime.
I am confident, that the government of the United States with support of the international community will put aside this detrimental attitude.
I hope for my being in the situation if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled me appropriate at the responsible clarification of the facts of affairs concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports, and law-appropriate involve.
I am pleased onto a conversation with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified and it thanks you for their efforts to protect the international right that protects us all.

On the way through sludge rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help into faraway villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with treating hundreds of patients
In the west-African country there are not many doctors, only one, for 5,000 people
You vote here or with your mobile from
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs too the top 10 of the „CNN Heroes of 2013".
They can agree for it or one of the other heroes in the top 10, to choose around it to the „CNN hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 dollars for the continuation of his extraordinary work
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father lost the consciousness again and again and traveled to hospitals which did not have the means in order to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was hurt by Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981 at a car accident near.
First he had only a broken arm, however, then an inflammation which expanded onto his brain and a Hämatom which should influence it for the rest of his life caused there formed itself.
„There were not any neurosurgeons in Cameroon", according to Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it out from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead of this Bwelle spent years with accompanying his father in full clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment which they had to offer there.
Bwelle comments, „It is not simple
One can leave at five o'clock the house in the morning and run that to the hospital in order to be the First and nevertheless First is not.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they must wait.
The situation hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only a doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand the relation is in the United States near a doctor for 413 persons.
However, even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Live two of five people in the country below the poverty border and are almost three quarters of the health editions in the country private.
„The only problem which they have is the poverty", says Bwelle.
And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy the life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering let mature in Bwelle the decision to undertake something against that.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out in the last year 700 free operations.
He became even doctor and works as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition he based a non-profit organization by the name of ASCOVIME who travels to rural areas at weekends and offers there free medical care.
Since 2008 it and his volunteer group have helped just 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday it and up to 30 people squeeze themselves into minibuses and go the verschnürten medical outfit on the roof about unfortified terrain into the villages that require help
Not always everything goes by smoothly.
Already more than once they had to shift the vehicles through rivers and sludge
However, if they arrive, they are received as heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation which the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason for the celebrating and Bwelle – with his wide smile and his boundless energy – is there gladly during the cheerful celebration.
At the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
„Per journey we treat 500 persons", according to Bwelle.
You come from a vicinity round the village from 60 kilometers – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a series of fields
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transferable illnesses.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – not simply be able to afford a document that is necessary for the school, however, many poor families.
In the evening the team carries out simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations occur usually in a school, the city hall or an apartment; according to the intervention the patients get up and go into the recovery field in order to do place for the next one.
The light for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday work.
It is a hard workload but the village musicians help usually with holding the team in a motivated way.
„You drum the whole night so that we remain awake and can continue our work says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team drives back then into the city, tired, but proud of the achieved work
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out in the last year 700 free operations and knows that it causes an enormous difference with their work for the people who it helps.
A man declared that the free operation of an inguinal hernia which he received makes to work again for him possible now.
„That changes the future of my family", thought the man.
Next to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
„I do really not know when he sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, who studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group.
It is always in the hospital either or attempts to raise money for the organization so that it can go onto these campaigns.
For medicine and nursing students as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experiences which they would never get at home.
„We can be in the case of operations in this case, where we help, to dab blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle", declaredly O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring along frequently donated Sanitätsmaterial.
If they are, however, first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transportation and the instructions.
„He is completely a hero without doubts", says O'Malley.
It dedicates his life of this organization and his wish, to help the Cameroonian nation, does not know any borders
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load.
Helping to others to a happier life and giving that to a promise which it gave to his father prepares great joy for him.
„I am so happy if I do this work thinks Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope, he sees what I do.
I do it in order to make people laugh again and in order to ease the pains.

Pope Franziskus appoints in February first cardinals
Pope Franziskus will call on 22nd February for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic church as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the rank-highest clergymen in the Catholic church after the Pope and they that elect a Pope so that Franziskus in this way will appoint the first group of men that finally will participate during the choice of his successor are it also.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that an old man of 80 years reached cannot participate anymore in the pope election – that falls to a group from 120 „elective cardinals".
In a declaration in which the information was announced padre Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals will occur before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals is kept off which is known also as a Konsistorium.
„Papst Franziskus decided on announcing his decision for the calling of the Konsistoriums in February in advance in this way other meetings, that" the participation of cardinals from all world require", be able to be planned, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the elective cardinals until February will probably have sunk.
It declared the number of the elective cardinals again in this way a Pope appoints usually as many cardinals as necessarily in 120 is, and as many cardinals above 80 as it would like.
The Konsistorium in the next year is important, because it is the First since the choice of Franziskus in March this year's, so Valero.
Currently there is a certain overhang of aufseiten Europe and in particular Italy.
„It will be interesting" he said „to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world in order to reconstruct the balance".
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, however, they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will be also the First ones to be called since the education of the council of the cardinals based by Franziskus for finding a group of eight cardinals from the whole world that has the task possibilities for the reformation of the church.
In the past the Pope decided on everything alone.
„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals who are supposed to help him", said Valero.
It declared it is „well possible" that Franziskus the cardinals around council please.
However up to now we were not in this situation – that is everything very again.
Valero said that the bishops would appoint as cardinal typically from big places, nevertheless Franziskus of „full surprises" puts „– we do not know therefore who he appoints".

Is it ready to Europe's elite to do businesses with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring the economy onto a table and to define, which those ones that provide prosperity and work in Great Britain would like to change at our relationships to the EU.
Too we commissioned the greatest and most comprehensive inquiry to this purpose among British economic leaders and they asked what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted more than 1,000 managers from the economy, that into about instance the British enterprise sizes, -sectors and show regions
The results of the inquiry will surprise many.
We found out that meanwhile the predominant majority of the enterprises exports outside of Europe and concentrates on countries that modernize and increase while the states are stagnating in the EU.
You want that from government page new commercial connections with countries as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of stopping oneself with the long and hard process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders of the opinion the control of these key competences should be fetched back according to Westminster is asked for their opinion on certain by law controlled topics – of the restrictive trade practices act up to the product legislation.
There was it general dissatisfaction with the home market since meanwhile according to the enterprises the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe's commercial zone – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises that are traditional at the Europe-friendliest agreed to that.
Finally, and that says presumably the most, our questioning of economic leaders made, that a clear majority change of the agreement is wished from Great Britain a course in the direction and a relationship to the EU that is based on trade not on politics
This discovery which finds itself with the case of enterprises of all sizes and leading company groups shows that the economy is urgent onto a „reasonable change" which brings the notebook of the action again to Great Britain.
It is a question of a lot – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead at 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a plebiscite.
The prime minister should not have any doubts: This inquiry shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership
It also shows that the enterprises expect a clear shift of the power relations of some new negotiations back to Great Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary in increasing measure, after the euro zone moves now in the direction a narrower economic and fiscal agent union.
Jobs and growth must be the priority in Great Britain, as the result of our inquiry it shows which enterprises an increasing attention to trade and a basic change in the Brussels approach for rules means.

Kenyan press outraged about controversial media law
„We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: What keeps the parliament from eliminating tomorrow simply the judicial independence"? was to read in the newspaper, that the draft for not constitution holds.
„The law is Draconianly and very punishing and we refuse it", Cyrus Kamau, manager of the Capital Group to which also CapitalFM belongs said one the independent radio stations' most looked at and information web sites' of Kenya.

„I hope, the president listens to us and we appeal to it to refuse this draft and to return to the parliament", he said.
According to the newspaper The Star the government takes „the media effectively" through the new law „into a choking-grip". On the other hand writes The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered „a difficult stroke", and entitled the draft as „Draconian".
The discharge of the law belongs to a row from measures with which the national security is supposed to be strengthened in the Nachgang for the attacks through armed Islamisten onto the west gate shopping center in September.

In the Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association to be able to show already considerable successes was celebrated.
The first presiding one told to Henne detailed of the work of the association.
He himself was in the year 2004 the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed-hospital in Nouakchott.

In addition Fuchtel stressed that global economy requires also global love of mankind.
It is not supposed to be forgotten also by any means, that Africa seems likely as some thinks.
From Gran Canaria it is not wide to Africa.

In the days in front of the Kilbig with the case of the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard a small angle wall was built-in, for the stabilization and static discharge the more than a hundred years old hewn stone wall with balustrade.
The further procedure plans, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger city construction office, to include the country monument office in the plannings and to create a renovation draft for the old wall.
After that a cost calculation through experts is supposed to be carried out which then is supposed to be put to the district council to the decision and determination of the further procedure onto the table.
A decision on that will fall probably already in the coming year.
To the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school inner court within the two side wings of the school uplifted in 1912 in forseeable time as a consequence measure the renovation-needy limitation wall entirely must be renovated and be put on new foundation
The delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße historical, a hundred years old, is renovation-needy particularly through water and frost damages since no drainage is available and has an arch inclination forward.
Deep cracks in single stones show weather damages, however, the wall is not currently collapse-endangered.
A stable wall is assumption for one of pupils schoolyard use, what occurred through the current fixing works
The schoolyard renovation was initial even already in the years 2008/2009 planned, nevertheless high unsystematic editions brought a shift.

Gutach: Still more security for pedestrians
You do not stand any 100 meters of each other away: On Tuesday is in Gutach the new at 33 pedestrian crossing light at the village parking place in operation taken - in range of vision of the older city hall traffic lights.
Two installations so near with each other: Intention or Gothamite prank?
Gutachs mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The city hall traffic lights were installed then because this safeguards the way to school", explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights safeguard both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The yesterday officially in operation taken installation is important for the crossing field brawn creek way/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area >Grub<.
"During the high traffic and pedestrian appearance must to those one security some further traffic lights here", so Eckert.
This confirms also Peter Arnold of the District Administration Office open castle.
"According to current measurements daily about 12 000 vehicles go through the municipality Gutach on the B 33, from that about ten percent are heavy load traffic", stresses Arnold.
Therefore the construction is more than necessary to some further traffic lights: "Security simply goes on here", so Arnold.
In total four traffic shows were carried out, also a roundabout was thought, was rejected, however, again because of the narrowness in the crossing field brawn creek way/Kirchstraße.
It was tested to traffic light posts before according to Arnold during the location choice the everything: "Means' of one means of transportation extra burdened with especially long wood tribes for us have we ausgestestet, whether these vehicles can go from the brawn creek way onto the B 33, without which to snap" traffic light posts.
The about 15 000 euros expensive traffic lights installation itself is that most "modern, what currently there is on the market", Arnold explained.
The installation is endowed with colored LEDs which shine so strongly that the lights are to be recognized by the motorists for example also at inferior sun well.
And it is economical also: The older lighting systems use about 100 watts, that new just once eight watts.
Per driving direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technique of the new installation This is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian presses the traffic lights button, tests the upper radar sensor the traffic situation.
The street is free, green comes immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it lasts about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks, whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
"Should a group or gehbehinderte people about the street go, the green phase is prolonged, it comes therefore every secure above the road", Arnold declared.
Of course the motorist must show initiative here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic lights did not show for pedestrians green, a superclass vehicle roared through - with the case of radiant red.

Bird saved by air rescue service from North Sea drilling rig again released
A bird flown by air rescue service onto the coast that had been found exhaustedly on a North Sea drilling rig was retired again in the nature.
The Wasserralle was flown last month to Aberdeen, where she was fed up by the Scotch animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue centers in Alloa, with a helicopter.
Colin Seddon, conductor of the center, said: „This Wasserralle was probably a winter migrant from Nordeuropa which was stopped through the strong winds above the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird searched refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: „It could not weiterfliegen anymore, for which we were contacted with the request around help
With the case of their release the Wasserralle was again fit and healthy.
Drug tunnel with own railroad discovered between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico which was endowed with light, ventilation and electric rail company completely was discovered now.
The US American authorities described the tunnel measuring 90 centimeters in 120 once as one of the most polished passages which they would ever have found.
The tunnel which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just six grounds joins storage depots near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area it gives countless inconspicuous storage depots what it makes easier to hide LKWs loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was locked before drugs in an unrecognized way could be transported in that, declared the authorities.
During the discovery of the tunnel eight and a half tons of marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were put in custody, so the recordings of the court
Three men who worked as drivers according to the authorities were accused of the possession and the intended sale of marihuana and cocaine.
Prison sentences threaten you with the case of a fault saying between ten years and lifelong.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network from Entwässungskanälen.
The tunnel is the eighth big passage to be discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered according to the marihuana harvest in Zentralmexiko in October, what puts the drug cartels before the challenge as they can bring their product to the consumers quickly.
In the year 2010 authorities found a just 640 meters long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign employees with 457-visas could be subjected „to genuineness test"
The government thinks within the framework of broadened measures about a „genuineness test" for foreign employees with 457-visa.
The test should be introduced, it would be used about a criterion that is supposed to prevent that that is used 457 for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the Zuzug of family and friends to Australia.
Today a discussion proposal of the government was published after the former representative of the lab-party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the government with regard to foreign employees because these of the neighbors of Australia could be understood as an insult.
„Loud declarations as ,Ausländer are supposed 'to act behind‘ and 'stop ,Australier first‘ is a very unpleasant relapse into times in which trade unions demanded a protected labor market", she told the Australia India institutes today.
Historically considers was said that, that white workers should be protected – and if some vernähmen a reverberation of this historical artifact in the region that would not surprise me.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures which once were thought by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor who yesterday stayed to conversations about human being smuggling in Sri Lanka transformed five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the „genuineness criterion" is taken over, somebody that applies for a visa could be checked then in such a way, whether „the request is really in the cases, in those of the proposers in a related way or personally united with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise is."
Companies could in addition be obliged to put aside account for the number of the 457 visa holders after finally in the past enterprises which first of all wanted to support only a small number of workers employed hundreds.
Meanwhile a 35-year old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker died presumably of a heart attack after it had arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The verstörte nine year old son of the man who had come to Australia with it is looked after by a grown-up cousin who was also on the boat since the death of his father on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place does itself with giant mirrors of light
With gigantic mirrors the inhabitants of a Norwegian Örtchens brought light into their dark valley.
Because of the low sun idea degree the Rjukan of fall until spring sited in the Vestfjord-valley versinkt usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height became on Wednesday a century dream true.
"At last mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed during the start ceremony in the sender TV2.
Some valley inhabitants moved sun chairs, others put on sunglasses as a precaution make sure.
Up to now sun-hungry ones had to go onto a near peak in the winter with a cable railway
Ten years ago the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to steer the rays with mirrors into the valley.
There was this basic idea, however, already since 1913 in the place.
After debate of several years the town council councillor had adopted finally the project 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) expensive.
A similar construction is providing for some years the Italian alp place Viganella with winter sunshine.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the topics interior and justice.
The responsible team came together for that at the morning in Berlin.
Among other things it is a question of direct democracy, representative bribery and the federal police.
On morning also the team of migration and integration wanted to continue their consultations
In this case double citizenship might go among other things around the topic with the case of which both pages have contradictory ideas
The SPD would like the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany, to decide for one, end - the union refuses a double passport
With the case of the topic traffic which does not stand on this Friday on the meeting order the SPD supported their refusal of a Pkw toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "Flatrate for the a lot of go and in this way ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiation leader explained traffic, Florian Pronold, for the topic in a writing onto his faction
Ausweichverkehre on country roads threatened which already now are accident emphases.
The introduction of a toll for all Pkw would be only a first step furthermore from view Pronolds.
"It the danger that to a later time the compensation is deleted for Germans exists", he said.
Shrill cheeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard invested also ashore strongly.
You distribute the coal coming of the ships onto the slope.
The enterprise has at the location now several irons in the fire.
Next to the coal import Rhenus Midgard puts among other things on wind installation logistics.
Black the coal glimmers on the storage area in front of the dike
Two tremendous blue Slope pour- and moving-chargers chargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
At every movement of the envelope devices a shrill warning-noise sounds over the ground.
"The signals are used for the security and are by law stipulated", says Matthias Schrell, manager of the Rhenus Midgard, in Wilhelmshaven.
At wind standing detrimentally that is to be heard unfortunately to a large extent - and so there were already some complaints of people from the city north.
He accepts the complaints very much and contacted therefore the concerned persons, says the 40-year long one.
In narrow agreement with the authorities one is now at holding the danger signals with technical measures more quietly
Also in the future he puts on the open dialog with the neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell plans still some at the location
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge Rhenus Midgard keeps on putting on the coal import for power stations and one of the large ones is on this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the chaise longue tub hollow on 18.5 meters in front of the terminal also Capesize bulk carriers can be dispatched for a long time here.
"This year we" want "to crack" during the envelope" the 3-million-ton-brand according to Schrell.
Next to the Eon power station on site the import coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power station still goes onto the net, 5 million tons of coal import per annum are well realistic.
The three Schiffsentlader on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingens mayor Michael Maier.
The commune sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person.
The district council agreed to the sale in his recent meeting in the part not public.
The building changed his owner for an "adequate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied", stresses Maier.
In the budget 100 000 euros were applied.
Not yet clear is, as the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
Right is it to the mayor, that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to somebody else before the winter and thus more does not have to pay for the conversation of the house, as to give off a good heat, to look to the garden and to evacuate the walkway.
"This expenditure is now away", Maier pleases itself.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress ourselves up for the neighborhood.
Today I rather became the Halloween-sourpuss.
In the last two years I did not declare myself readily to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will not do it presumably also this year.
But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns to Halloween.
The majority of the Americans - 158 million, in order to be exactly – this year of Halloween celebrate and in total 6.9 billion United States dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations distribute in this case, according to the US American association of the retailers (NRF).
A thing, onto which I me every Halloween then nevertheless again pleases, the trend values are.
The costumes will form about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion of spent United States dollar, according to the NRF.
This year seductive inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women must wrap no more in sexy clothing, they can embody now pizza, hamburger or carrots also seductive food as about instance.
I every amount expect what concerns to men zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bets, the Daft punk space men will get it this year into the Instagram-Feeds.
According to Google zombies, Batman, pirates and witches are the meistgesuchten costumes.
I presume, it nothing is turned at tradition.
We covered last year our dogs and were not in this way alone for my astonishment.
In fact Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their domestic animals, according to the NRF.
Those ones are an amount „Hot Dogs".
We are not what concerns to sweets oversensitive.
Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollars for that, according to The Nielsen Company.
Those ones are about 270 million kilograms at chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and rubber bears.
Therefore good news for those according to US Board of Trade of Commerce of Commerce 41 million people that pull „Sweet or Acid" through the quarters with the saying.
In fact we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not show anything to ourselves – eat.
The only thing which we would not like to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless 15 million kilograms of that are sold around Halloween, according to the National association of the sweets manufacturers.
Those ones are about instance nine billion maize kernels.
It is a puzzle which I could not solve yet.
Nothing belongs anymore to Halloween as houses which it haunts.
You have splendid names as „Terror Behind the Walls" (what after all the way stands in a real prison), „Howl-O-Scream" and „The House of Shock".
There are in fact 1,200 officially acknowledged spook houses to America Haunts so in the United States that 500 million dollars achieve proceeds, and that includes the wonderful photos on which one pees just into the trousers and that friends put then on Facebook, where one does not rid oneself of it again, and the type onto which one stands leaves a comment to one then as „nice facial expression".
But let's come at last to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown machte vertraut us with the Large Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is as the adorning of the Christmas tree – something, that we have done of small on.
Fortunately that one began „Baby in the pumpkin" trend only last year thanks to pint rest, so that most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin, and not, to be in that.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, so the US Census office.
The pumpkin lantern which rots slowly in the front garden comes presumably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.
If you liked to score correctly, you Tim and Susan Mathisdon call then into Napa, californiums at and you carve something pretty from their 921 kilos heavy pumpkin.
Pimp must into the prison
Because of exploitive human being trade procuring, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury the Constance District Court court condemned a 33-year old man to three and a half years of custody from St. Georgen.
The former German Federal Armed Forces soldier who worked as a doorman to two actions in Afghanistan made a confession within the framework of a process agreement
Accordingly he became acquainted with women about internet or telephone contacts who he sent onto the line after some weeks against their will in five cases.
It maintained resistance with power and threats break.
He retained the gains of the women who partially for years ordered for it
Through confiscation of mobiles and SIM cards it stopped contacts of the women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who provided the women it brought it into different brothels in the southwest.
There he made her be controlled partially in order to control their gains.
In court court the defendant said first of all he suffers from a difficult trauma after colleagues died in Afghanistan next to it at an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert great doubts about the psychological restriction and so that at a restricted fault ability pointed out, the 33-year long one laid down a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to vernehmen any of the harmed women anymore.
As a criminal investigation department official told, at least four more cases of exploitive human being trade could be determined according to a first advertisement through telephone monitoring methods.
The conversations listened to were shaped from high aggression.
In later examinations the damaged ones would have confirmed her martyrdom.
A further female witness with whom one of the women had discovered blue spots at the whole body did not do any statement until today.
It is a question of "a completely broken personality" who regards power and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He broke away from these circles and wants to lead after the custody a very normal life", it thought.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the lab-party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales a determination is initiated through the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW-minister denies having changed the regulations for the maritime lease on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid which had covered participations in three plots on from a government viewpoint controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ independent commission against corruption) expanded on Friday their investigations for the question whether Obeid influenced different Ministers of State in such a way to extend leases at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids practiced two restaurants and a café, without announcement after their outgoing in August 2005.
Now the accusation is investigated, Tripodi knew about Obeids concealed interest at the plots, after Tripodis former deputy stick leader Lynne Ashpole on Thursday had testified corresponding.
In conversations lasting for years which began in 2005 the government had insisted on public announcements for the leases.
On the other hand the tenants were and wanted furthermore longer terms.
In 2009 the leases were extended for the enterprises at the Circular Quay that were the Obeids worth annually 2.5 million dollars without public announcement.
Tripodi, that was of February 2006 until November 2009 harbor minister, had spoken out initially for public announcements.
However, he denied to have made the changes at the request of Obeid who as Tripodi confirmed had insisted on a conversion of the lease regulations of the government.
A telephone record presented to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official that was changed into the harbor ministry that having worked under Obeid in the fishing authority.
„The topic discussed about in these telephone conversations was the preparation of the commercial lease regulations the deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked.
„No", Tripodi answered.
I cannot remember, which was cured but that was not it definitively.
Definitive not between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA-disclosures intensify company paranoia because of state supervision
On a mild day at the end of August a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt on the Main, the finance capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the federal velvet for intelligence service and terrorism abatement (BVT), the German inside secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US Außenpostens that there is little as 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.
According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the existence of supervision antennae and the action led for an argument into Berlin between the USA and the German foreign ministry of State.
James Clapper, US American Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September once again on the USA not using any possibilities of the foreign espionage „in order to steal the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf of US American companies in this way these their international competitive capacity or their profit could extend."
However since Edward Snowden, the former employee become to the Whistleblower, began with the publication of his horn of plenty at US American supervision secrets, European governments and enterprise leaders are not more sure, whether they can take the director with the case of the word.
Reports according to which the American National Security Agency ausspioniert the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and got herself for data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo brought the company paranoia onto a new highest level because of state supervision.
The barrel for the overrun brought the disclosure, that chancellor Angela Merkels was a telephone verwanzt, possibly already for ten years.
If the most powerful person can get into the visor in Europe, also managements are potential objectives then with security
Snowden made the intense cooperation between US secret services and enterprises transparent.
I believe, it is conceivable that these data are used to the mutual benefit.
„Germany must wake up", declares Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi who represents small and middle IT companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe, the USA represented now an almost just as great risk as China did if it is a question of industrial espionage and data theft, such an inquiry that was published by the consultant company EY in July.
In the documents seeped from Snowden it, however, up to now did not give any proof that the USA passed on the companies confidential secrets of foreign enterprises to own companies.
Politicians expressed their worry over the EU lacking certain IT and internet possibilities and her should reduce their dependence on the USA.
The enterprises are sceptical concerning that.
In the Bundestag Federal Parliament it was suggested we should build up a German Google.
I can close only my eyes and open it slowly again...
„So that does not function, Hasso Plattner, chairperson of the German SAP software manufacturer, says.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have made her become extinct 20 years ago then.
All in Germany is subsidized, of the coal above cars up to the agriculture.
All, up to the IT branch.
Nevertheless companies that before had seen the greatest espionage risk in China shocked range and technical smartness of the US espionage authorities uncovered from the Snowden-disclosures.
With the Cloud Computing a great change occurs because European enterprise conductors are now more conscious that in the USA stored data of the nonlocal jurisdiction are defeated and therefore potentially endangered are.
According to an inquiry carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after the disclosures about the US American data Mining activities with Prism for instance ten percent the not in the USA resident members plans, to be useful an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy manager of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customers that a year ago there was not yet – it says: Where my data are stored and you can guarantee that these stay physically in this right room
Many German enterprise conductors represent the opinion the recent reports only simply confirm that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore these must be guarded at all costs what they in any case already knew indeed.
That industrial espionage occurs is not a surprise.
That was always like this.
„A topic was for many years and did not change itself through the current discussion in a basic way", says Kurt Bock, chairperson of the chemistry enterprise BASF.
The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, so as we that also do, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises.
The management does not boast usually about the countermeasures that one took, because with that provides assailants advantages.
In great enterprises employees are already long blued to, that the taking along of a free USB-Sticks on a fair or the unattended forgetting of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, putting it mildly.
Collecting the mobiles so that they cannot be used as monitors says to Ulrich Hackenberk, board member near car manufacturer Audi, that it belongs to the standard practice for years before an executive board meeting.
The German BVT recommends managers to use simple Prepaid-mobiles if they go onto trips abroad because smartphones can be possibly compromised.
The Prepaid-mobiles are thrown away afterwards.
The worry withstands it, however, that small and middle enterprises remain Hacking and supervision vulnerably opposite.
In Germany many of these enterprises are worldwide market leaders in the respective niche.
„Small and middle enterprises often miss the experience, the personnel and the financial resources in order to protect companies confidential secrets effectively against not authorized access the BVT warns in a report.
The USA warn own companies against industrial espionage through other countries.
According to Washington mail office France, Russia and Israel were classified in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February behind China on rank two of the countries which used the Hackings for the procurement of economic data.
A board member of a German Blue-chip-enterprise agreed if it is a question of industrial espionage, then „the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former conductor of the French inside secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with following words: „The secret services know very exactly that all countries ausspionieren their allies even if they cooperate in the fight against the terror."
When the horse show experts became accustomed to crowd in Cardiff in order to choose the horse of the year, they were conscious that a hard competition approached.
However, no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The little fellow that is not even in the kindergarten yet and only a few months ago did his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and got the first price – at which 30 grown-up opponents let it behind themselves.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised because of their appearance behavior and style during the annual competition, which is on its way from the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry Cardiff is organized.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put on his plate cap in an insolent angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the Juroren for his natural abilities with the case of the contact with the pony who would lie far about his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had gotten toffee last March as a present to his third birthday and practiced since then every day with the Shetland-pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: „Fenton and toffee are a splendid team."
You had to compete with the entire participant field and went with gold cup and rosette from the place.
It was first the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Complete foreigners in the arena held it for so phenomenal, that they wanted to be photographed with it
The small boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows into the footprint of his aunt Sharon Howells who is demonstrating horses for more than ten years.
Told to Howells: „The whole public was how electrifies and all fired it and clapped."
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand and in spite of his looking so tiny, it achieved fantastic work
Fenton is mad on animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens which he takes care of.
So as it started, it will long not last, to it on that one „Horse of the year" show is – and I am sure, that he will come off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: „Fenton is first to three, but he knows how he must deal with his pony."
Together they are a fabulous team.
The Juroren measured Fenton and toffee according to how they would have beaten themselves well and presented themselves in the demonstrating-ring.
You pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I am secure that Fentons sweet clothing contributed their part to that to myself, that really matched the reason perfectly.
Care day at the small Englishman hut
To the in the meantime fifth care day in the succession of the Natura 2000-project's of upper Hotzenwald hit a group of engaged participants near the small Englishman hut in Ibach.
Due to ideas from the population the look should be cut into the valley on this day in the field of the hut freely, said mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers described, according to emperor, this field as the shine piece of the gorge footpath on which the landscape offers the ideal frame for marvellous views.
He thanked the person presents for their willingness to the collaboration and stressed, the care day is a suitable instrument in order to starch the connection of Mensch and nature.
It offers every citizen the possibility to set even accents in the nature.
At the same time as the touristischen aspect also the ecological consideration can find.
Friederike Tribukait of the department nature conservation of the government executive committee explained this ecological aspect to Freiburg after the greeting through country council Tilman Bollacher who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
The touristische objective of the foresight corresponds according to Tribukait to the objective to receive the old Allmendweidfeld meanwhile strongly grown over with his specific protected living space types through opening and connection to the still existing pastures there.
Certain kinds as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest faces.
You need these free connections for the kind preservation.
Tribukait said she does not want to fail at this place to break a lance for the planned biosphere field.
The current measure does not adapt to this planning only seamlessly.
A biosphere field also offers the chance to lasting economic how ecological development on the basis of the internationally acknowledged Unesco-Status and thus a continuous supplement of the one Reached with the Life project as well as the previous care days for the future.
District conductor Christoph Wehle and Life project manageress Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers according to this different carrying out in groups.
The larger trees had previously already been beaten the forest tractor stands where appropriate on call.
A group of helpers should see to the release of juniper bushes and around the care of a dry stone bolt.
Objective was the free view at the lookout.

Royal field: Small team beats itself bravely
The Voluntary Fire Department overcame their fall dress rehearsal in spite of personnel lack with bravura.
Only eleven Mann accepted the practice teil.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had selected himself in his practice assumption the estate feather in the Burgberger street.
There a short-circuit is supposed to have arisen during the sawing.
Two people were hurt by the arising fire and the formation of smoke, one of them could send, however, another emergency call.
Two respiratory protection carriers of the resistance made themselves ready to enter the building after the first inspection of the state of affairs through Hans Kammerer.
After short time it succeeded, that first person to find and to see into the free one.
The second person had to be borne.
This was not so simple since also some narrow stairs were to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was simply not to be safeguarded.
It a lot of wood and also bale of straw in that rested.
There still kept on being electrical machines to the woodwork.
The first putting attack occurred via the tank in the vehicle.
A further management occurred via a Überflur- fire-hydrant in about 100 meters distance
Now three putting attacks could be arranged.
A hollow mouthpiece was used also in the building.
It was for Hans Kammerer a question during the practice also of showing what with few available personnel is to be managed.
In the emergency a support occurs via the day task force royal field.
The commander showed himself in a satisfied way with the course of the practice
Iran in a satisfied way with process of the atomic negotiations

It would be indeed still a long way, but the atomic head agent is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic, that both pages come at the end to a solution.
Rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for Tasmanian health service
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, that are tied together with the rescue parcel more than 325 millions Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal state cannot waste the money.
Federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, that Commonwealth will take „immediate measures" in order to avert a crisis that through an aging population of the developing island country, a higher rate at chronic illnesses and system restrictions has been caused.
The financing for a period of four years was concluded after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian representative Andrew Wilkie.
„The government tied up an emergency rescue parcel that concerns to the unique challenges to which the Federal state sees itself opposite according to our opinion declared Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar-parcel contains 31 million dollars Soforthilfe for choice services.
Remains are supposed to be removed by further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments because of gray star.
In addition there is money to services for day clinics into Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, in the field psychological health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
„These investments correspond" to the ideas from which affected clinic employees said to me they are the best possibility to correct the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a severe report and account duty of the Tasmanian government.
The Federal state must retain the current financing level in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly about where the additional money was spent.
A three-headed commission is established and is supposed to guarantee, that the Federal state provides National Health Service so effectively and efficiently as possibly.
As Wilkie declared today, the 325 million dollars would be useful only little if „they are not accompanied from real reforms which bring the public Tasmanian health system onto a more lasting course."
Nevertheless he praised the government for her reacting to his request around urgent help which it expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.
„I am confident, that the federal aids will perform" „a great contribution to taking the public health system of the Federal state of the worry list", Wilkie said.
According to the government of the Federal state these choice services will wettmachen the recent incisions to a large extent.
Nevertheless the health-political speaker of the opposition on Bundesebene, Peter Dutton, thinks the present announcement is only a „plaster solution".
„We are therefore in the present situation because the lab state government deducted 430 million dollars from the health system", he said opposite ABC TV.
It cannot be, that a state government tears almost half a billion of dollars from the system and sticks in the Commonwealth 300 million and then so do as if were the good straightening.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that a single dollar of the rescue parcel is not spent for additional bureaucracy.
From protest against the planned rich man tax the French soccer will pass through in fact the first strike since 1972.
An arbitration meeting draws to a close without any result result.
In the conflict around the rich man steering wheels the government and the pro-soccer in France after a failed arbitration meeting maneuvered themselves into a dead end
President François getting-country received indeed on Thursday in the Paris Élysée palace association and association representative and listened also to their complaints.
He refused, however, to spare the soccer of the planned 75 per cent delivery on incomes of more than a million which all companies of the country are supposed to pay from 2014 for two years euro per annum.
Also the opposite side remained hard.
One will also pass through the strike announced for end of November now, the head union of the pro clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The game days scheduled between the 29th November and the 2nd December in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are canceled thus.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman breakfast of this year in the evangelic church municipality Bisingen.
"Proverbs from the Bible" and "Turns of speech from the Middle Ages" were topic of the day in the community center.
Zita Köhler, the chairperson of the Kirchengemeinde- rats, paid attention to the breakfast in a lecture to the biblical proverbs.
"Proverbs contain aphorisms, rules or warnings", it declared.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible places and explained the importance
She named proverbs as: An eye is watchful to Holzauge how scales fall from the eyes on somebody fling, the gentleman gives it to his in the sleep, his hands in innocence wash.
Repeatedly the consultant made their listeners guess also which proverb it was a question of.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took care of the turns of speech from the Middle Ages: All good things' are three, blue make something verhauen.
It explained importance and origin of the turns of speech which she mentioned "Bridges into the past".
To the end a tombola was verlost.
The prices lay coveredly on a table and were paraphrased humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Under the visitors of the breakfast round also mayor candidate mixed himself novel Waizenegger.
One could name it the Dostojewski of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories have also something serial.
Amazing the kinship in the outside appearance: the pricking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And the way Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive Oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist of the Russian soul one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who in the own country something is absolutely meant for.
Some titles appeared in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans-Kassette with the 118 stories markets second ending-unity.
Thickly America declares - the empire of the breath-taking technical progress combined with paranoia, security delusion and the belief, to be chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read themselves as a mixture of the revelation of the Johannes and a computer-manual.
Maybe it was mad, had added drugs to his brain.
He understood, early already, that the computers Divinitäten are.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked the creator of his creature what distinguishes a human being from a machine.
That is the "Blade Runner" -problem.
The killing.
A master of the Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This history is now especially significant.
The "minority-report" comes from the year 1956, it verströmt the odor of the Cold War and the McCarthy-tribunals.
The principle of the "Prä-Verbrechens" is developed here, "Pre-Crime", that is what meanwhile is more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dicks world, that ours frightening resembles, mutants look into the future - and the police access.
"We register individuals who did not offend against any law", says the head of the authority.
"We grab it to ourselves, still before they can commit a power crime".
And: "In our society there are not any felons, for that we have a punishment warehouse fuller Pesudoverbrecher". You read time streams
You accept that bad one happens, and prevent that the criminal thought is put into the action.
Dicks story works as the blueprint for the anti-terror-laws and the listening-drunkenness of the NSA.
Antizipation of the assault So functions also Obamas drone philosophy and practice.
But Dicks story is not to end yet.
The police chief laments that there is not any power division anymore the military controls the everyday life - and what of the state is remaining.
Then the supervisor itself is controlled and transferred to a future crime.
The system spins.
It is perfect, however lies.
It invents his own conditions.
Does not put up with errors and victims only, but builds itself up on that.
The system creates the danger which opposes it.
Philip K. Dick read is said, again and again, to come to the truth closer.
Court blocks decision to the Stop-and-Frisk-guideline of the NYPD
A federal court of appeal in the USA blocked on Thursday the order of a judge, the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program („stop and search") the New Yorker Polizeidepartments had demanded, and the judge released from the case.
The 2nd US court of appeal declared the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin would be misfired to to an appointment of the city is decided.
The judge had judged in August, the city offends against the constitution with the kind and way in which the program for the hold and questioning is transformed by persons.
The city appealed against their assessment and the ordered remedial actions, including the decision to fit out a supervision center which is supposed to support the police in the change of their guideline and the corresponding training program.
The court of appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the demanded suspension.
The one declared to appointment report, the judge must be released from the case since it hurt the behavior codex for US American judges when it is certain that a judge is supposed to avoid the appearance of the partiality; this was justified in part by media interviews and public statements in which it had reacted to the criticism of the court in public with a row
The judge had judged, police officers hurt the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they would take in inappropriate manner purposeful black and Latin-American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program into the visor.
She appointed an external place the supervision of the conversion of essential changes, including reforms with the case of guidelines, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras borne at the body in quarters in which most controls were carried out.
In August the city of New York declared itself readily to end the practice of the storage of names and addresses of persons that was released after a control through the police again.
Some verbal negotiations for the appointment of the city are planned after the 14th March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk-tactics was criticized from a row by civil rights advocates.
There are controls of this kind for decades in different forms, nevertheless the number of the recorded controls increased from 684,330 during the term of office of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg onto a space time high per year in 2011, most men black of that and Latin-American.
In 2004 complaint that developed into a collecting-complaint was submitted by four men that all minorities belonged.
Proponents of changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create them some trustworthier and more effective police as well as influence them the kind and way in which other police headquarters use the regulation
Opponents do not think the changes would subdue the morality of the police, however, the criminality; also money would be wasted and not solved the wider problem of some police that is under pressure to the abolition dew sender of places in the last decade.
The judge referred to her not ending the Stop-and-Frisk-practice which is constitutional, but reforming only the kind of the conversion of the controls through the NYPD.
Anger above judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people that had died in 2002 during the bomb attack in Bali reacted annoyed about the judgment for the last one of the instigators that was put in court court since Umar Patek should be shot to death according to their opinion state-legally.
Patek that was just ten years as one of the meistgesuchten persons of Southeast Asia on the run was condemned yesterday to a prison sentence of 20 years for his role near the construction of exploding-bodies for the bomb attack.
With punishment suspension he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year long one was been the mass murder for guilty because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter from Kuta at which 202 people died under that 88 Australians, and a lot more were hurt.
A fault saying in addition occurred in a series of terrorism-related charges which churches belonged a wave to from explosive agent assaults in Indonesia at Christmas Eve in the year 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a lifelong prison sentence even if she could have applied for the death penalty punishment for the man who is called brilliant bomb farmer because of his call also as „Demolition Man".
The decision woke painful memories with June Corteen, a mother from Perth that lost their 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation prepared by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting they said, Patek should have been condemned to the death.
I really think it should follow into the footprint of the other fellows.
„One should put it before a shooting command said Corteen opposite AAP.
I must live every day with my not getting any further grandsons and never again seeing my daughters.
The sari club was leveled with the earth when on the 12th October 2002 shortly to 23 o'clock a tremendous bomb in a small vice exploded which was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bars, where only 20 seconds formerly a suicide assassin made a rucksack filled with explosive agent explode.
It fell after the assault into the coma for a month and „died" three times while he was loving a life preservation system.
Hughes said, Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and imam Samudra – that was responsible for the bloodbath and four years ago was executed.
Real, this type should get the death penalty punishment before all others.
To let it at the life – no, there is not any reason to let it at the life.
20 year is not to be gotten after it killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds a lot.
Patek is the last one of the Bali-bombers which stood in court court.
It took away almost a decade of the arrest from itself was picked up, however, finally in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where US armed forces killed the former al-Qaida-leader Osama bin Laden later just four months.
During the negotiations a FBI-agent stated that there was Patek in Pakistan in order to affect bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the connection between south-east-Asiatic terror groups and al-Qaida that secret service reports would have produced the tip
„He did not surrender", said Corteen.
Until recently it did not show any remorse for how much sorrow it caused to other people.
The judgment passed before the decennial anniversary of the assault this year which is inspected with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
„There will be this year many tears", said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.

Leg almost chopped off: Reprint of rocker-process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up after more than four years again.
A process because of attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and material damage against two 30-year long ones began before the Frankfurt (Oder) District Court court.
It is accompanied from severe safety measures.
The defendants kept quiet about the prelude.
You are supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged then to the Bandidos.
The prosecution reproaches them to have pierced into Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices on three men in a car and to have struck.
All victims were hurt heavily, a man would have lost almost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have belonged to the concurrent grouping Hells Angels.
One is supposed to have been a hochrangiges member from Berlin.
Apparently a pursuit hunt with several cars had preceded.
According to accusation it was a question of district fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been absolved at the beginning of 2012 in a first procedure.
A court speaker said then it was not able to have been proved that the men were in fact participated in the bloody feud.
The culprits had borne masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice canceled the judgment after revision of the prosecution and it referred for the renewed negotiations onto the District Court court back.
One of the defendants is currently in the open execution because of another Deliktes.
For the prelude it was a question particularly of the reconstruction of the courses in the action night.
As a witness the superintendent investigating then was summoned.
In the center mobile conversations of the defendants and further persons who the police had bugged stood
It is difficult that rockers in court court almost always stick to an iron for them law - and not testify.
That is valid also for the victims
In the first process only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) prosecution said on demand new tracks have emerged since the last procedure.
For the process eleven more negotiation days are scheduled.

Traffic lights on continuous reds: Paying attention to waiting time
Sometimes some traffic lights do simply not become green.
The contact bow in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What one is supposed to do then - with the case of reds go
A concerned person waited long enough at some red traffic lights and the crossing is free, it can weiterfahren, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker declares in the magazine "motorcycle".
The waiting time must be, however, "adequate", which can be laid out from case to case differently.
Becker recommends to wait at least five minutes from a malfunction of the traffic lights go out is.
Who continues the journey in spite of red light must be, however, im Klaren over his bearing the full fault for an accident caused through that.
Who is patient less than five minutes does long enough not wait possibly, warns Becker and refers Hamm to a decision of the upland court
In the discussed case a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to justify himself for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic lights were not indeed defective, but they jumped little later onto green around.
A going-prohibition kept on being spared him because of the special situation - the fine, however, not.
Profit losses at Bombardier according to drop with the case of delivering-numbers and tasks
The Canadian airplane and railroad manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced on Thursday a 15 per cent drop of the clear profit after he had gotten under pressure through regressive orders and deliveries over at airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railroad section.
Bomb published with seat in Montreal also no flight test data for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and did not give any new information about that, whether the airplane according to the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.
Onto the old maid flight of the test flight stuff before one months up to now only three more starts followed, what makes him appear questionable, whether the test phase on schedule proceeds.
The results remained behind the predictions and led to a sharp fall in prices from more than eight percent at the stock exchange from Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform" on „sector perform" in the regard on a restricted course potential having the stock in the next one to two quarters.
„Indeed weaker delivering-numbers were largely expected at airplanes, however, from the margin development in the transportation field we are very clearly disappointed", said Doerksen into one to customer writings.
We think that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the check programme strides for the airplane.
If, however, in the coming months no new orders are announced, we expect then that the market becomes more sceptical opposite the program.
Bomb hopes, that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment that currently is dominated by Boeing and airbus.
The first test flight stuff was introduced in March to the public and flew after delays lasting for months for the first time in September.
However up to now obligatory orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderat since potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the claims of the enterprise with regard to fuel efficiency and cost saving-potential of the new nozzle airliner are appropriate.
Currently there are in total 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.
Executive board chairperson Pierre Beaudoin gives himself confidently, that Bombardier will reach his objective of 300 obligatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management in addition assured on Thursday opposite analysts and media the program lies in the aging schedule.
„The test flight stuff did not stay longer at the ground than expects", „Beaudoin would say at a telephone conference" and would add during the endurance life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were scheduled.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided on undertaking a first flight and attaching a reworking period then which we also did.
That happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test airplanes will start probable in the next weeks, the remaining ones shortly after that, it was called from enterprise page
Nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the old maid flight the first customer can take an airplane of the CSeries in operation.
Bomb declared, it checks the planning for the initiation (ICE) and will update these in the next months.
„The slow striding the flight test – also when they correspond to Bombardiers of internal planning obviously – confirms" Doerksen said „our opinion that the initiation postpones onto the first quarter in 2015".
In the third quarter with end on 30th September Bombardiers clear profit fell on 147 million dollars and/or 8 cents per stock from 172 million dollars and/or 9 cents per stock per year before.
The adapted profit per stock is as before 9 cents.
The turnover gave insignificantly and sank from 4.2 onto 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per stock and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson of Reuters I/B/E/S.
The worldwide fourth-tallest airplane manufacturer declares he handed over in this quarter 45 airplanes a drop of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes on 26.
The order backlog in the air and space travel section was on 30th September 32.9 billion dollars and was in this way unchanged opposite the 31st December.
„In the field air and room journey the results lay within the framework of our handicaps however the low incoming orders and the market conditions in total were disappointing", Beaudoin said.
The turnover in the air and space travel section fell about 13 percent onto two billion dollars.

Scientists could fling more light on in which connection the tail wag of a dog with his atmosphere stands
Former investigations had shown that happy dogs waved more to the right with the tail (from view of the dog) while it was being the left page at nervous dogs.
However, now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to that.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a Neurowissenschaftler of the Trient university, said: „With the human being is well known, that the left and react right hemisphere differently on Stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we attempted to notice this about us with the case of other species.
He in addition noticed, that at dogs as with the human being the right hemisphere is responsible exactly for the movement of the left page and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the case of the feelings.
In order to find out more about that, reacting to the lateral tail wag of their fellows, the researchers controlled the animals, as dog while these films of other dogs were looking at themselves.
You measured the heart frequency of the Vierbeiner and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand, why the tail once into one, once in motion into the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed films with dogs to the dogs – either a nature-true version or a silhouette, in order to eliminate other aspects turning away, and we could control in this way more towards to the left or to the right the movement of the tail."
If the animals saw, how one otherwise blank dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely loose
The tail inclination was, however, above all to the left (again from perspective of the dog that waves), so their heart frequency increased and they looked restless.
In the view of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate on purpose with each other through these movements.
It is rather convinced, that the dogs would have learned from experience, at which movements they should do themselves to worries and when not.
He said: „If one has different meetings with other dogs and the wag is linked with the tail into a direction rather with friendly behavior and produces the right page rather one less friendly behavior, then one reacts to basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to a better sense of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behaviors and guest scholarship holder at the department of animal medicine of the university of Bristol declared this was not the first study at the was examined, whether to the left and to the right important for dogs is.
Last year a team of the university found out that dogs turn the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog from Lincoln and to the right, if it is a question of a satisfied dog.
In another study work at the university of Victoria in Canada following stood „Dogs rather go towards a robot dog, if his ,Schwanz‘ waves to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study.
According to his statement the differences could originate therefore from the dogs not interpreting as dogs the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs in the different studies.
A study, to react to real dogs as dogs, could help, it declared.
„Indeed it gives considerable proofs of many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, nevertheless many of the details must still be determined – and dogs do not form any exception there", so Bradshaw".
Since their behavior, however, can simply be recorded, it will long presumably not last until we understand why the tail sometimes into one, sometimes in motion into the other direction.
Tony Blair declared it would use the chance for a return as a British prime minister – adds however, that a comeback is improbable.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his elimination from the office the 59-year long one announced his opinions on different inside-political topics.

TO UN announces new objectives with the case of the poverty abatement
The United Nations begin immediately now on with the preparation of a series of new objectives with which the twelve years ago announced millennium development objectives for the poverty abatement are supposed to be replaced.
In the front end of the UN-peak for lasting development which began at the evening in Rio de Janeiro Australian diplomats played a decisive role with the case of the advance for „lasting development objectives" which are supposed to replace the 2015 millennium objectives running out.
You were picked up into the definitive draft of the document that will be adopted by world-political leaders, including Ms Gillard, with the case of the peak.
UN-secretary-general Ban Ki-moon declared at the evening on the peak the time came „to think about the national interests out".
„I am pleased with the member states agreeing upon tackling a process with which universal, lasting development objectives are supposed to be agreed", he said.
„These objectives will base themselves on our progress from the millennium development objectives and form an integral component of the framework for the development after 2015.

Pawnshops boomen in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop in the shopping center Bendemeer in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a few earrings in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
„My husband and I bought just a house, there my whole money is „in that", Amirthalinga says.
Although they every month 3,000 Singapore dollars (ca 1,730 euros) than administration employee deserves and their husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it explains.
In fact the demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the budgets increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out their exchange, became the third pawnshop to be listed at the Singaporean stock exchange this week.
The pawning of jewelry is not only a fast way in order to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsaved bank loan.
Typically pawnshops require in Singapore an effective year interest of 17 percent that lies only just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas demands Bank a local credit grantor with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawnshops offer, however, the advantage that no inspection of the creditworthiness or income proofs are necessary here, for which loans are more fast than possible near banks
For this reason millions of people turn in the region to pawnshops after families sense the pressure through increasing costs of living as well as an increasing budget and consumer indebtedness.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed markets families with smaller and middle incomes consult pawnshops in order to balance so the difference with the case of stuttering economy.
This week the rating agency described standard & Poor's wachsende budget indebtedness, main through increasing mortgages, as a factor of risk for the creditworthiness of Asiatic banks
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have according to assessment of the agency the highest budget indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands with 80 percent of the BIP at the top of the list, a rise of 60 percent still in the year 2008.
Nation business persons worry also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week just from a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed an export weakness keeping on existing and a remission of the consumer demand.
„In the final effect that means, that faced with increasing costs the people in the middle one will attempt to lower segment (the income scale), their to complement" „incomes where that is always possible," says song Seng Wun, economist, at CIMB, a Malaysian bank
Historical highest levels with the case of the gold prices of gold in the last two years still intensified the trend towards the pledge of personal objects since the people take the opportunity for changing the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned objects are gold in the 200 pawnshops of the city state.
The people tell: „The gold price of gold looks good, let us grandmother's Goldkette pawn and fetch back next month."
The tallest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20 per cent customer increase in his branches in the last months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong, that ValueMax would like to expand, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only into the adjacent Malaysia – where the enterprise practices four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, manageress of ValueMax.
The enterprise finances that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore-dollars which it took this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.
While some credit grantors were getting into the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yeah declares that pawnshops would not offer only more favorable interests than other lenders, but did not increase the debts directly either.
„Customers grant a loan on objects which they already own and the liquefaction of personal articles of value does not extend the Haushaltsverschulung", it explains.
The pawnbroking business is accepted socially increasingly as a short-term, protected financing.
Also all people are not, use the pawnbroking, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of ValueMax in order to pawn gold bars and Rolex-clocks for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price cash.
To us customers come from every social shift
„Prosperous ones who lend something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises which must bridge bottlenecks in the Cash Flow belong to that", says Yeah.
Sometimes they also simply need money only very much quickly.
Rangnick-Schelte for ski resistance: Mane no swallow king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current top form of Federal League Tabellenführer Red Bull Salzburg also is, so disappointed the sport director of the "bulls" of the referees showed himself.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan into the category are pushed swallow kings", he defended the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday on a press conference in Salzburg.
Recent reason for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday at which an alleged acting for the doom became to the Senegalese - that certainly was not a how the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant incorrect decision", meant Rangnick, the referee Harkam as "completely overtaxed" described.
Harkam would have contributed furthermore "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter to the lot.
He defended his German compatriot dezidiert: "There I would have behaved in every single situation now as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had after the Scharmützel with Hütter any contact with his colleague.
I would not know, why.
"Because I am that one that was offended", stressed the 46-year long one.
Faced with the success race Rangnick sang, however, a praise hymn.
"For that there are only two words: Correctly well", he stated.
Misfiring a lot does not give.
Particularly the kind and way in which the team plays is impressive.
That is supposed to go on quietly so.
There will hardly be cadre changes in the winter transfer time.
There are not any splendid reasons to change something.
"Except for a player confronts with the wish, that he wants to leave the association", Rangnick explained.
A study which is supposed to increase the advantages of the HS2 railroad project for Scotland was announced by the British government.
In the work of HS2 Ltd it is suggested to realize already with beginning of phase 1 per year 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Traffic minister Baroness Kramer said, the project will bring together Great Britain nearer.
The Scotch Minister of Transport Keith Brown declared it is very delighted with the British government at this plan to work.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed railroad connection between London and the west Midlands.
On completion of phase 2 there will be according to connections Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high speed trasses between London and north England of 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government which stands in conversations with transportation Scotland charged HS2 Ltd to search for further stretch capacities and travel time improvements for north England and Scotland.
The possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or little belongs to that from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baron's daughter Kramer said: „Our objective for HS2 is a really national railway network, the Great Britain and his cities nearer brings together."
We precede with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages with themselves.
Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our traction network.
However it is a question also of the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scotch undersecretary Alistair Carmichael commented: „The present announcement is a good information for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scotch government Keith Brown Carmichael asked to support the Scotch integration „unmistakably" into the HS2-network.
Brown said: „The high speed railroad connection contains the potential of enormous economical advantages for Scotland, simultaneously also the economic strength of Scotland supplies, however, an argument for fast railroad connections in whole Great Britain."
Therefore we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high speed railroad connection in Scotland that creates advantages for all and the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh complements that the Scotch government already plans.
I look forward to examining the research report with the British ministers in the next year and deciding on the next steps together.
Living with future perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives marvellously.
Your house lies in one quiet residential area's of Stuttgart with a lot green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and neither too much traffic.
Into the city it is only few minutes with public means of transportation.
"You are not afraid it is to be hoped of spiders"? Waltraud Ries asks and points at a fat spider at the door frame.
I search already for some time a new apartment for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the worry, it declares not to be able to overcome the many stairs anymore in the age to the house and in the apartment.
Furthermore: For a meniscus-operation the Mittfünfzigerin has had to find out at the own body what means to move from storey with Handicap to storey.
Recently first a book was published from it on the topic 'Live happily in the age - Which Living-Form the best is for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what' does not 'work' in the age at all begins to tell it
When it more than 20 years ago with their husband moved into the May sonnet apartment, it was only simple a beautiful apartment right in the Green Party member
Today with middle fifty Waltraud Ries thinks different about that.
She also knows, however, that she belongs to the few people who deal with the topic 'Live in the age' anyway.
Most replace it as long as it works.
Only the others get old always', she says smiling.
Only if the suffering pressure is really big one is concerned.
'Then it' can 'be', however', already too late', according to Ries.
In their book the interior designer presents 17 living-models for an even specific living in the age.
'Which living-form one, however, chooses is always an Individualentscheidung', it declares.
There is not D i e solution for the age.
Even who can afford the age transition fit in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can become also sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language vereinsame one also in the Dolce Vita', the specialized book book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider.
Under their models classical care models, alternative living-forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG, are found.
In the age everyone has so his tics and flaws
'For me such a flat-sharing community would not be, however, anything' she thinks with a wink.
Already not at all as in a Studenten-WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'In the age one simply needs also his withdrawal rooms', according to Ries.
That nevertheless a senior flat-sharing community can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress.
That must go by then differently, however, than in the classical Studenten-WG.
And sometimes one simply wants also only his rest', she believes.
With this opinion it does not stand at least in the capital only there.
Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay 'as long as it works in their own apartment', also the experience of Theresa Rütten is, the head of the civil service life in the age of the capital.
Your office advises people around the topic 'Get older'.
Therefore older people would just accept also inconveniences and restrictions frequently only in order to be able to stay in their usual surroundings that is also the experience of the foundation product test.
In this case there are today many possibilities to design the house or the apartment barrier-freely.
Ream is recommended to all that deal with the age-just reconstruction of their house or their apartment first once thoroughly to inform and not to charge the first-best craftsman.
Today there are specialists also for the age-just reconstruction.
Even in the flat let for rent one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But not always the existing apartment is let age-raked and reshape in this way barrier-freely even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Indeed one could install a stairs lift within the apartment, the way paved also with stairs to to the apartment door would be, however, the by far greater obstacle.
It will weitersuchen until she found the ideal object for itself and their husband.
She is terrified by the move more by it than by the spider at their apartment door.

Two investigation officials followed the suspect and saw how it went to Dittas house and laid the drugs with a purity of 60 percent there under the garbage can of the attorney in a black golf glove.
In a word after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough phoned regularly Ditta who was during the supper in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The attorney returned home, got the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court court it became known that Ditta was a „regular consumer" of cocaine after with the case of tests drugs of the class A in his hairs, his wallet and on his credit cards had been discovered.
Ditta was arrested later, denied, however, to take cocaine and said it spoke with the supposed dealer, because this his mandator is, and said their discussion is subjected to the „attorney secret".
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and attempted to remove a row from credit cards, nevertheless they were guaranteed and a hair test was taken from it
During the police interrogation he served, he practices an office both under his private address and at the job and mandators would call him at home because of juridical matters.
In court court it became known that he had called and informed important protagonists of the drug traffic from whom he had represented some before after important arrests of what the observers about them knew.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: „A criminal law law attorney should know better that one does not break the law than all others should."
Ditta is accused of the abuse of his position as a punishment defender since he went along with certain mandators too very much.
The relationship in question is simply not that of a drug trader, but a drug trader's that supplies his attorney with drugs.
A part of his communications was beyond doubt legitimate, because he was the attorney of these persons.
However, that exceeded far the borders of a normal relationship between attorney and mandator.
It counteracted the police investigations so far as possibly so that they kept on being able to follow their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute in this way.
It suited certain mandators too near, in particular Scarborough, and it permitted that his independence was compromised.
Ditta expelled every error behavior from himself and claimed: „If I was a corrupt attorney, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait then any 15 hours, but would do that immediately."
However after the hearing superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: „Herr Ditta added the step to a criminal from a punishment defender in the moment when he started acquiring drugs of organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless Kompromittierung and did it pronely to the motives of leading members of the organized criminality that charged him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Attorneys must maintain the highest standards at integrity and guarantee in public for confidence and confidence.
Ditta cheated this confidence and attempted to entrench oneself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta that led also to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession from cocaine and justice hindrance, which underlines our determination to bring criminals in court court.
This case should be criminals a warning and it shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law.
We find you and bring you in court court.
Prison was condemned to Scarborough itself to 14 years after it had declared itself to the conspiracy for the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade for guilty.
Thirty-five more at the drug traffic beteiligte'Personen were condemned to total punishments of 153 years because of drug offenses.
On his web site Ditta published a field with questions and answers above themselves in which he served, it is his dream job to represent as an attorney mandator in the death cell in America, his ultimativer guest during the supper is Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work
Up to the present time the police inspection Kempten can look back upon a quiet Halloween-night.
The officials were called to children egg-flinging only twice too that flung these against house facades.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and the ones remote like Eierreste, also no property damage might have arisen.
Furthermore also some Sylvesterböller were presumably ignited in the town area, but also here no property damage arose.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg announced, that his Pkw with loo paper wrapped and were stolen his wheel facing strips.
Up to the arrival of the police the man discovered his wheel facing strips again, however, in immediate proximity all of them, for which the police did not keep on having to become active.

Rat takes railway constructions siding tracks into the visor
Is the level crossing "Am deer" supposed to be rebuilt extensively in order to increase the road safety?
The district councils decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros for that into the hand.
The German Railways want to improve in the coming year the Kinzigtal bus route.
Especially the security is supposed to be increased in this case at level crossings - regularly it keeps up in a nationwide way to collisions of trains other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the structural alteration measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, railways and Federal Government divide themselves the rest.
Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the Bahübergangs "Am deer" to the district council.
There the city plans, in to build height of the nonlocal tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks a deflection.
There can also bigger vehicles, for example such that transport long-cut wood with the case of oncoming traffic traffic stand without having to block the rails
Grießhaber suggested therefore to construct a necessary retaining wall so.
This was discussed in the district council controversially since some councils questioned the necessity of a street circulation: Thomas Kipp brought the atmosphere of the critics with his comment onto the point: "We must take so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand"?
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The level crossing "deer" is used regularly for long-cut wood transportations.
Even wood from the field "cow creek is transported in part over this stretch because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the stretch at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition the stretch is used as Umleitungfür the vehicles that must not use the tunnel if the main road is spaced, argued Haas.
Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg- and castle mountain tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated as this is currently the case in Wolfach, "Am "deer" also for a longer period can be to the level crossing "of an important traffic importance
The councils agreed on making examine which costs the thought broadening of the street would cause.
Despite that was agreed the reconstruction of the level crossing mainly with the possible specification, that the necessary retaining wall is built so that the city can extend the subsequent street where appropriate direction "Railway station trasses" for meeting traffic on about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand the reconstruction of the level crossing near the tannery familiar wine could involve a very different problem which affects the access into the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" going up strongly.
The administration had made examine the reconstruction plans of the railways of the engineering office Breinlinger since she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way is still possible without further one.
The investigation came for the result, that it is not to be excluded that the inclination relations of the street could result in longer vehicles sitting up.
The responsibility for that supports in turn the city as a road construction load carrier.
The reconstruction can involve accordingly liability quarrels.
Since both the wood removal and the turning in the current capacity stage functioned, one is not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the level crossing, argued Haas.
Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is clearly smaller at this place than at the other level crossings because the breakpoint middle to which a good line of sight connection exists is directly next to that.
Even trains of the central station would have to be here at this place already so far slowed down that no collision threatens.
Mainly the approval was refused the reconstruction of this level crossing since the city of Schiltach "would have to pay" for the problem with vehicles sitting up, according to the councils since the railways can withdraw from the responsibility on completion of the construction works.
The committee considers the reconstructions as unproblematic at the level crossings "Before hay creek and "Before cow creek for which already crossing agreements with the railways were reached.

Airport Vienna abolishes passenger-calls

Syria destroyed his possibility for the production from chemistry arms according to a supervision group
Syria destroyed important facilities for the production from chemistry arms and Gitftgasmunition, declared for chemistry arms on Thursday the global supervision group while it was resulting in the north of the country in hard collisions near one of the locations at which probably poisonous substances are stored.
Also on Thursday a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since beginning of the civil war now already soon three years ago.
The announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical arms (OPCW) came a day before the appointment at the
1st November which the Damascus organization resident in The Hague had put from ammunition in order to destroy all facilities for the production of chemistry arms or to make „inoperable" including all machines for the mixing of chemicals to poisonous gas and the filling.
The end of this process which represents the first stage of the destruction basically is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule which is aimed at the destruction of all chemistry arms of Syria until middle 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria cannot produce any new chemistry arms anymore.
Damascus must still begin, however, with destroying the available arms and inventory
According to assumptions there are in the country about 1,000 tons at chemicals and arms which also mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin number among.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fights occurred in the city of Safira of the experts say that there is here a production equipment for chemistry arms as well as deposits as the Syrian observation place resident in Great Britain for human rights informed.
The activist group which follows the number of the dead about a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday 120,296 people died.

Assads troops are fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels from whom many connections to al-Qaida-groups have.
The observation place said there were on Thursday losses on both pages did not name, however, any details.
The fights underline the danger that the chemistry arm inspectors are misfired, because their mission for the liberation of Syria of his poisonous arm arsenal is a race against the time among a raging civil war.
According to statement of the OPCW that cooperates with the United Nations closely the team is „now convinces, that it all named by Syria important Production- and seen Misch-/Befüllungseinrichtungen and has lived their destruction."
Therefore „no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week the inspectors had declared they would have finished the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of 23 of the places declared by Damascus.
Because of security objections the visit of two facilities was not possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday the OPWC declared, the two locations were „given up according to Syrian statement and the there available objects of the chemistry arm program were moved onto other mentioned facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the place was one of the two facilities which the OPCW-inspectors could not visit in Safira.
Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of his chemistry arms which must be approved by the executive committee of the OPWC next month.
„I pull the hat before the bravery and the courage which you all showed while filling the herausforderndsten mission which ever was explained by this organization", declared Ahmed Uzumcu, the president of the supervision organization, in a comment published by OPCW.

RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from their currency department, according to two persons which people are trusted with the situation; this is a further index for the worldwide official determination for the probable manipulations being a match at the currency market in a fast way at journey
Some of the biggest banks of the world, including UBS, of Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities at the investigations in the worldwide greatest financial market on which daily 5.3 quadrillions of United States dollars change the owner.
The two traders would be the first RBS-employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation which the scandal involves around the Libor interbank business
The bank which did not give any comment on the suspensions confirmed this month that she received information inquiries of authorities.
„Our investigations on this topic go on and we co-operate fully with the FCA and other regulation authorities", said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month persons being close to the situation served, that the RBS the recordings of E-Mails and Instant messages, that of and onto a former trader were sent, passed on to the British inspectorate, the Financial Conduct Authority, has.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and meanwhile is supposed to have been relieved from his present position as a European conductor of the Forex-spot-trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, conductor of the European spot Trading at Citi, was relieved this week and check mate Gardiner, formerly leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week with the case of standard Chartered.
None of these traders was reproached for any error behavior.
To the Instant Message-Gruppe of Usher bankers belonged at Barclays and the Citigroup, said persons being close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that she did steps against some of their employees after the Swiss regulation authority had declared Finma that she examines a probable manipulation of the foreign exchange market with the case of a series of Swiss banks
Employ at least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US American Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – currently with reproaches after which bankers are supposed to have arranged in the case of transactions at the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse initiated in addition internal investigations or received information inquiries from authorities, said persons, familiar to the situation.
Banks look through Instant messages and E-Mails from several years in search of cases of error behavior.
The traders in a field moved the news about these investigations into riot that belonged to one of the most profitable of the Trading units in the last years from investment banks, but was under pressure this year because low volatility restricts the chances with the case of currencies for speculators.
Some bankers attempted, to ran through the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and extremely liquid foreign exchange market, nevertheless leading traders think that this is not absolutely true.
A leading trader noticed, that in spite of the enormous daily volume in the foreign exchange exchange trading the fragmentation of the liquidity between the different commercial platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms through banks for this purpose would go, that one can influence the market already with very small ticket prices.
The information came out on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced, she fired this week to a trader of their London Exchange Traded find offices after it had caused a loss of just six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank informed the responsible authorities promptly and cooperates with them.
We are secure that the trader alone acted and that the matter is checked", Credit Suisse declared.
Coulson used Telefon-Hacking for the checking of a tip
The former news of the Word-Herausgeber Andy Coulson employed supposedly „Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation" during the attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the former Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey a wrong rumor that Clarke would have a relation with his „attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby belonged to news of the World in such a way in May 2005.
The newspaper charged the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mail, and hunted, however Coulson also called her and left behind news as the court found out.
„According to opinion of the prosecution Coulson that now Herausgeber is the NotW is not to catch anybody that stands before the apartment of people and hopes it on fresh action but one, the people's confronted with a history gladly in order to see their reaction" declared Edis.
He said NotW uses three procedures in order to investigate histories investigativ: Telefon-Hacking, supervision and confrontation.
The editor is participated in the third method personally.
Obviously he knows about the second, the supervision, it cannot be different.
How does it look with the first?
He knows above the Telefon-Hacking Bescheid?
He denies that, but we say: „And whether he knew about that."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were picked up first by the feature editorial staff from NotW when a source that was sexually interested at Pawlby was said to: „You" do not „waste your time, she is with Charles together."
A volume with voice mail of their telephone of at least three reasons apartment was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires.
The observers in addition found entries on the computer of the detective on whom Pawlby and their sister as „projects" were stored.
In the time, when the investigations ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, declared Edis.
Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18th June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with following contents to her: „I have a story which we want to bring out tomorrow which I would like to talk about gladly with Charles."
Edis declared about instance the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett Coulsons activities with the case of this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett confronted because of an affair with a married woman that had been then married when it was associated even with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have oneself with others verschworen between the 3rd October 2000 and the 9th August 2006 telephones chop.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup added the Telefon-Hacking.

Nevertheless it gave only a slight shift with the case of the age of the Menarche (Appearance of the first rule bleeding in the last 40 years.
In the United States the average age at 12.5 years, a little little, lies as 12.75 in the year 1970.
„If the development of the breasts begins, it lasts still at least two to three years up to the Menarche", said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „Morning puberty with girls: The essential mentor for the contact with this problem occurring frequently".
During the most exact test is, as the puberty strides.
It is controversial what in fact represents the beginning of the puberty, nevertheless it is valid „precociously" if the breast enlargement is accompanied from a growth push before an age of eight years.
In most cases the process slows itself down or stagnates – something, that a child specialist can control exactly.
In the case of faster striding tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to the delaying of an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: to the early aging of the bones that can lead ultimativ to growth inhibition and in this way small body growth with adults.
The recommendations for a medikamentöse or hormonal therapy base themselves on the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz what concerns, but grants medicines is reserved: „The suppression of the puberty can moderate behavior problems to be different than their contemporaries and the feelings of girls."
The other great problem is understandable: Parents would simply not like, that their very young daughters have the period.
„You worry because of the pregnancy risk or about that as they handle the hygienic page said Kaplowitz.
„A shock was", a woman whose daughter got their days with ten remembers.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
It came verängstigt and annoyed by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are not any conclusive proofs of hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media being causal.
Boys come similar to girls into the puberty formerly.
Kaplowitz thinks the most convincing premise is the epidemic of the corpulence.
It supported the realization of a study in the age of six to nine years that makes a connection between body fat and the entry into the puberty per year in 2001 above girls.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors which played a role.
In this country Afro-American and hispanische girls tendentially rather achieve the puberty as their white contemporaries.
There are for that different declarations
Globally an early puberty seems from all possible things to be influenced, of economic conditions about the climate up to the genes.
A further puzzle: Although the face and shame hairiness increases to boys already formerly, the trend towards a vollumfänglichen former puberty is not as marked as with girls.
Other doctors on the AAP-conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even with babies and small children.
„We must be cautious as we identify the true beginning of the puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe, at the Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate with making oneself from their child specialist be advised as they should speak with their child.
„That can mean, that one formerly than expected a conversation must lead, Kaplowitz guessed.
If one remains quiet the child reacts usually well.
Girls that early blossom need the insurance, that the process is a normal part of the life, self when it formerly than thought kicks in.
Illmensee: Second Mountainbike-race inspires participants
In the case of marvellous weather 214 cyclists came according to Illmensee in order to overcome the cylindrical course about the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel of the organizing club Illmensee informs of that.
Among the participants were, in particular on the short distance about 15 kilometers and 300 height meters, also numerous Jedermannsradler that wanted to carry out their hobby once in competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were in this competition also at the start: Good placements came to Felix Bader from bath forest lake and pascal of Treubel from Aach-Linz with the recommendation at the German Championships.
These Two could put as expected from the field.
As in the previous year Felix Bader could save a small time projection until the objective and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance.
Onto place two pascal of Treubel could place itself once again.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare, who got it very above onto the Siegertreppchen.
On place two and three came to Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
The increasing number of drivers who live in the municipality or work is a pleasant development
Not only what affects the capacity was the whole bandwidth at sportsmen represent.
Also the age structure reached from ten years at the youngest ones up to more than 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race still more absolute top athletes were this year at the start.
Four drivers could leave from the regional top drivers.
Under that Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike half pro of the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl was a world champion together with a team colleague already two times in the twelve-hour-driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With in this case also Roland Ballerstedt, the already two German master titles' in the Duathlon his Eigen calls.
After 45 kilometers and 900 height meters it resulted in a lash stroke final in the target finish in front of the three-lake-hall.
Pangerl raced as First about the target line.
Only a second behind that could safeguard the second place to the Routinier Ballerstedt in the total evaluation.
Simultaneously then Hermann and Warthmann as third parties party of the total evaluation came into the objective
In the lady evaluation Christiane Cohsmann was the time-fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch protected itself the second place against Natascha Werner from Binzwangen from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers showed themselves in a very satisfied way with the smooth one and well organized course of the event.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack objective in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighter planes would have attacked Thursday night an objective in the Syrian harbor Latakia, confirmed a leading government employee to news opposite fox terrier.
The official did not explain what the objective was, said, however, it was at least one thing.
According to Associated Press it was a question with the case of the objective of Russian SA-125-Raketen.
At least twice Israel already carried out this year air strokes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Before the district derby against rogues traveled BVB-supporters with signal rockets had guaranteed for ugly scenes in the Veltins-arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced then hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the soccer Federal League against the VfB Stuttgart the Ultras with a silence reacted - at first.
A new, almost already spooky acoustics was, that the observer to shortly before the starting whistle of the Federal League game between the German vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park offered.
The guest fans with their songs were mainly to be heard.
The south bleacher against where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB-fans stand was presented at first unusually quietly No songs, no battle calls.
The platform of the Capo which otherwise coordinates the common Anfeuerung remained vacant.
And very in front on the bleacher a big flag with label "Section stadium prohibition waved in an alone way.
Only as a goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller as always as a first BVB player the place entered, short-term rejoicing surged on.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud song and waving scarves - however for a long time not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south bleacher nothing moved.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel counted the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory above arsenal, contract prolongation of coach Jürgen Klopp - once again, did not guarantee for celebration mood.
Only five minutes in front of the starting whistle the Capo climbed up his platform - and the until then almost with hands tangible strain unloaded in a loud scream, than Dickel as usual asked the atmosphere on the ranks in the stadium.
It was up as last as always to the south bleacher - and the loudest place was final here again as usual in the stadium.
And at the latest than with starting whistle of the south bleacher the loud request "suits Derby winner on" came, everything was again as always.
The silence before was presumably a reaction to the events of the last days.
Immediately before district derby near the FC some of the traveled BVB supporters signal rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the place had fired hatch batten 04 - and hit in this case almost goalkeepers novel Weidenfeller.
The game was started because of the chaotic scenes in a late way.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had obtained the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras then in his office - and one believes Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be for the entire ultramovement massive incisions", announced the BVB-boss at the Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As a Sofortmaßnahme Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home match against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that", it declared.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance-politics as regards pyrotechny.
Furthermore different possibilities of a penalization were shown to the Ultras - up to the Tuesday have decided these now time for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will define a sanction until end of the coming week.
"That becomes drastic", assured Watzke.
One may be tense as the reactions turn out on the south bleacher then.
What happens on the way with my E-Mail?
E-mail is called really actually electronic letter.
Was the letter secret transformed with the case of the draft of the internet-service similar to E-Mail as at the traditional mail office technically?
During the conception of the early internet services stood to the fore, to make communication possible.
Therefore one did not pay attention at the basic technical protocols to creating a stable foundation for an anhörsicheren correspondence.
Therefore a traditional E-Mail rather corresponds to an open postcard as a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", the computers of the two of them are then directly joined?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step to the mail server of their Service-Providers.
If she has for example a GMail-account, the Google would be.
This mail-server sends the contents to the Provider which Benni uses.
On the stretch the mail can run across many other servers in the Internet.
Bennie can phone his Provider then the contents.
Are traditional E-Mails read on their way by the net?
Most mails are read on the way repeatedly by software-robots.
At the Provider of the sender it is checked normally whether the mail leads a pitiful program as an appendix with themselves.
On the receiver-systems also a virus-check is planned.
In addition the Provider check whether it is a question of an annoying and unwanted spam mail the now putly or at least into a spam folder is way-sorted.
Do the robots have another further task?
With the case of systems as GMail the robot determines also the information which Google needs for the placing of context-advertising
When Anna and Benni by GMail communicate over their coming holiday trip, can insert links corresponding to Google to vacation offers.
Do also unknown people read the E-Mails with?
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail, is extremely small.
That is theoretical, however, possible.
In companies administrators have frequently the possibility to read electronic mail office.
Also the prosecution authorities and secret services caught legal possibilities, E-Mails or to take note.
For this purpose possible illegal spying actions come.
Is it possible to protect E-Mails against the monitor?
With an encoding according to the OpenPGP-standard an E-Mail can be enciphered effectively against monitors.
With high technical expenditure it is also possible to disguise the metadatas of an e-mail communication so that not even without further be recognized can who with whom has communicated.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail-market in Germany?
Near the mainly privately used post-office boxes Yahoo and Google according to an investigation of Convios only play consulting from August 2013 a subordinate role.
While the parts had been falling last from Yahoo-mail, GMail of Google could hot up the pace clearly.
Germany's biggest national church has an Offensivegestartet in order to advertise the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible priest lack: The evangelic Hanover national church reckons that the number of their currently about 1,800 woman ministers and pastors according to present situation to 2030 will halve itself.
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in the conversation with the Evangelic News Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien the national church charged for the first time a pastor to inspire young people for the theology study on a full place.
At the time of decide always less young people after the school-leaving examination, to study theology.
Burfien puts this down to the process of the Entkirchlichung: "Gottes Stimme is quiet the world is loud".
In this case the profession is shaped from great freedom and variety.
I am a gentleman of my diary and can put my emphases, where it is important to me, there.
Pastors could be very near as ministers with the people.
You deserved so much as teachers and could live well on that.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a secure employer.
That complies with the young people for whom it is a question not only of career, but of a sense-fulfilled work from today.
According to information of the national church which contains three quarters of Lower Saxony about currently per annum 60 pastors retire.
Simultaneously about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their curacy.
In sparsely populated fringe ranges as the resin, the Emsland or the turning-country it can become in the future heavy to fill places.
Burfien wants to organize among other things study days for young people and invite also prominent persons to that, have studied the theology.
The theology study offers a wide training.
One can become in this way even Federal President.
Hearing in front of the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees in front of accusations accused of Sexualdelikten against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA-employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of Sexualdelikten in connection with children before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah as the Royal commission heard from children for sexual abuse
However with the case of the opening declaration in front of the commission the YMCA had declared one had never had to put in the organization from sexual child abuse with an incident.
Manager Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of offenses with child pornography and another, at which a sport teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 because of the abuse had been condemned it children's entrusted with.
Hare said to Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, did not know the second, however.
He added the opening declaration of the YMCA opposite the commission was also inaccurate in the claim „there were external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA than at most front front with the case of the child security was acknowledged
Proofs in front of the commission rather show that the YMCA was informed about that.
Hare that began with 21 at the YMCA granted, the management failed „from me" of Lord „downwards" during the attitude and not guaranteed that employees realized their obligations to be reported violations of the guidelines for the child security
Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of Sexualvergehen at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was condemned to at least six years of prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which kept employees from that to announce lords violations with respect to the security of children.
The employees stated they would have observed violations among other things, that Lord was alone with children, was in charge of it privately as sitters, made her be on his lap it told with regard to one that he has it dearly, and made play children with his mobile.
Danielle Ockwell testified, that superior Lord was and that had asked for a training to the child protection because it was gotten because of his behavior, that the child service head Jacqui Barnat that in the YMCA Caringbah the superior was to lords „very intimidating and most time was very unapproachable".
The manager declared their superiors it would not accept statements of employees according to which these would not have dared announcement refund.
Instead of this, so he said, their friendship with lord rather influenced their discernment, for which they would not have announced it
Hare declared it informed the executive board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson that has to draw the organization from the „Jonathan lord incident not the reporting" through employees affects, and the executive board agreed to it
Hare said the decision to push the employees from secrecy obligations for the signature shortly after appearance of the accusations was made by the manager of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said a Kontaminierung of the proofs should be prevented in this way, which, however, „übereifrig" and badly was transplanted.
The YMCA NSW was not an organization secure for children in the time, when Jonathan lord was there busy in between 2009 and 2011, declared professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, expert for sexual child abuse the commission.
It explained that there were „serious problems" during the attitude inspection, training, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing was adjourned until 20th December.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On about 120 meters length is below Cologne a sewer from the Roman time keep.
Who goes to Cologne does not pass by the cathedral.
About 157 meters jut out the two towers into the sky and turn it into the second-highest church building of Europe.
Nevertheless only few visitors who gaze at the two filigree church towers foresee that discovering an amount gives also under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert as regards underworld of Cologne.
The service-center of Cologne-tourism is meeting place for his leaderships directly at the cathedral.
The round begins very unspectacularly: "We begin in the basement garage", Schulze says.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted an selfjust city, and therefore only that kept on standing from the residues of the old city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park hurry therefore past today also at the roman remains and park only their car.
However, who in a more exact way hinschaut, discovered in the parking deck D2 an archeological place of finding separated by metal railings.
About five meters of high ruins are to be seen of palm of the hand big stones.
"There are residues of the roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century according to Christ", tells Schulze.
Before it goes again back onto the daylight, Schulze makes the participants on the upper park level fling another look into a shaft dark, 15 meters deep.
That is the well of the old cathedral which is also hardly perceived unfortunately.
The Prätorium is next station of the round, and here the participants climb again down into the depth.
We experience the seat of the once most powerful man here north of the alps, the pregate of the CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what means CCAA.
"The abbreviation stands" for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", what on good German" so much as "City of roman right and city the Agrippinenser, founded under emperors of Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult means".
And near the Prätorium it is a question of the former governor palace, the power center of the roman empire at the Rhine.
From the vestibule of the exhibition a tunnel access leads to the roman sewer which is to receive length here on about 120 meters.
"You can go along a piece quiet along the so-called Cloaca maximums if you want" Schulze muntert the guests on.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After his getting the key at the cash box, it leads the group to a shaft 16 meters deep, accessible.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath", it declares.
The Jewish municipality built their bath deeply into the ground in order to come onto the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
Until today different water levels are ablesbar in the lower end of the Mikwe that origins decrease until the eighth century through changing turn-off levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archeological zone on the city hall place for which the construction works shortly are supposed to begin.
Up to the finishing still some years will go by, however.
Announced to country Rover Rally Series
In the interior running-seats and six-point-belts as well as a free intercom find themselves.
The options reach from increasing brakes, a service parcel with care of Bowler-Works-mechanics and logistic support up to vehicle storage between events.
Declared to Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler motor sport „The Rally-customers who come to Bowler changed."
You are not race drivers experienced all, but people, which are in search of tension and adventure as well as to an accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased with being able to reveal Rover and the MSA this way in partnership with country and believe of that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different Rally-disciplines in Great Britain and the exterior country and to prepare newcomers for the strains and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun at developing the Defender Challenge car – that becomes an entertaining championship

George Kerevan: The choice gives the Scots European deconcentration
A new day, a new terror history for the independence.
This time we are warned against an independent Scotland being necessary in order to join the Schengen-room as a condition for the EU membership
That supplies the keyword for histories about passport checks into Berwick and a border safeguarded with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.
In fact the possible economical advantages which more travel freedom would bring in the remaining Europe with themselves were referred in the Strathclyde-presentation nevertheless this did not play any role – as expected – in the headlines.
Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend their strict rules to themselves frequently if it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland does currently not belong to the Schengen-room the consecutive nonobservance would be only a small concession for Brussels in the corresponding train for what one really wants from the bulkheads.
Therefore actually no story.
And one, the already so in the years has come, that it resembles already a fossil: The first time I meant the „independence passport check" duck at least 40 years ago belongs.
In this case an interesting point disappears during the constant repetition of this ancient history
Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances to the European whistle
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
Those ones are the real European news: The plan great, understood after the war to the union of Europe came to a standstill.
With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.
Everywhere in the EU parties at ground win which are EU enemy or would like to fling the euro overboard as community currency.
Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative could get just five million voices for Germany – set up only this year – during the Bundestag Federal Parliament choice in September for themselves and drive out in this way the Free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) effectively of the Bundestag Federal Parliament.
There was always domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalistic Europe.
The current depression turns out, however, as a turning point point.
Because of the severe saving-politics imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by the adherence at the common currency many people think, the project Europe went too far.
Little has to do the crisis of the euro with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead of this the euro system tied down his members to exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that so gladly.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency Southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage opposite Germany recovers itself.
The only possibility consists in abbreviating wages and public editions – encouraged by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems a deep lies going European productivity problem.
As a consequence of the „green" energy guidelines prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy enterprises at the expense of the consumers – the European industry pays compared with the United States the Double for electricity and the fourfold thing for gas.
That is a paralyzing cost disadvantage how we could already look into Grangemouth.
All wage celebration spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry against that, of cheap American slate gas to be pushed into the corner.
When consequence works up a revolt, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.
After the war the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift that to Paris onto eye level with Washington.
Nevertheless Berlin does not need Paris more than gate for the political legitimization and Europe pressed his own economic policy which the changed French economy has to fight with.
The result: Marine Le Pens rightly directed, EU enemy front National won just a decisive by-election and referred in this way the ruling socialists to place three.
The most popular party is to the front National now in France with 24 percent of the votes – a first-in first-out warning for the British Labour party, that it cannot come from that, a split in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatic for the left winger.
What makes Le Pen with theirs for popularity wonly again among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU choices for that next year, one Anti-EU-, to forge anti-community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the Anti-EU-Parteien come off at these choices well – and that is very well possible –, such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time then.
This is the point onto which I want out: In future not far too far the wachsende resentment against the EU and the common currency will find itself for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but she will rather become something as the „Europe of the (sovereign) nations" which favored general de Gaulle.
Maybe Germany and a few of his satellite-economies hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanziert of this project in the hope to ingratiate oneself with the USA.
However, Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific room advises that Great Britain will only stand in the Atlantic rain.
Where does that have Scotland at all of them?
We can decide, a region of to be (in last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economical interests – to which also it belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what they where can put.
I presume Scotland could go in a looser European compound very well provided that we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with countries other, thinking similarly is simpler in a Europe of the nations not föderierten.
Otherwise we should consider, to match it to Norway and our economical independence kept.
The SNP-government in Scotland is – bemerkenswerterweise – the most successful political movement against the saving-politics in Europe and gained in 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the shortenings suggested (and carried out) which the Labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to account for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for an independence now only in order to get a saving-politics forcedly then from Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (but no mobile conversations lead)
Flight travellers can hear now of the takeoff up to the landing their electronic devices for the reading, works playing, music and the renown of films use, not phone, however, with the mobile, so the new guidelines that were handed over by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday in the USA.
Nevertheless the passengers should not expect that these changes are transformed immediately.
How they were implemented quickly would depend on the respective airline, declared FAA-employee Michael Huerta on a press conference.
The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowage of the devices according to the new rules.
The FAA declared, she received already from some airlines plans that would like to build up the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Also delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
„According to state of the plan we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices", announced the FAA in an announcement.
Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed.
You may not start it before then again if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
With the case of the entry into the landing the passengers must switch it off again and they must not start again before the airplane landed.
To the new guidelines airlines whose airplanes are protected against electronic troubles could allow their passengers, the devices also at start, landing and the FAA declared to use on the landing field.
Most new airliners and other airmen which were adapted by Wi-Fi for the use in bigger heights should fulfill the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
„If the new regulation is secure moved – and we cooperate concerning that with the airline closely –, both page of that, Glading commented on," profit.
We are it honestly said, to have to feel us with the case of this topic as overseers.
Nevertheless internet connections to the surf remained, the authority explained exchange of E-Mails, kept on being forbidden to plaintext messages or to download of data under three kilometers.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
Therefore still no „Words With Friends", the online game resembling Scrabble that played the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone, than he public-effectively had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch off the device while the airplane was being parked at the gate.
And heavier devices as laptops must be packed also furthermore since an injury danger exists here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight keep on being forbidden also furthermore.
The regulation competence for telephone conversations is near the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA cancels possibly prohibition for certain electronic devices with the case of start and landing
Last month mark of Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board said, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS news, mobiles would still be considered as a risk.
„To Handy are real a problem, not only because they could cause troubles potentially near navigation devices, but because we of the FCC know that the transfer from the air can interrupt also transmission fattenings", according to Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the branch which was started up by the FAA for the investigation of this topic recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In the last years the pressure increased itself to the FAA, to loosen restrictions on the use.
Critics as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the opinion there are not any valid safety reasons for the prohibition
The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the use of the devices became omnipresent.
In some studies it is talked about that, that forgets up to a third of the passengers the shutdown of the device or ignores.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices through flight travellers after reports about troubles of navigation and communication devices through VHF-radios carried along by passengers which then represented the newest technique trend had become known.
New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as former generations of aircraft, but they are also so constructed and approved by the FAA, that them electronic interferences nothing form.
Airlines are offering passengers Wi-Fi already for some years if the altitude is reached.
The airmen adapted onto Wi-Fi-systems are also more immune opposite interferences.
The predominant majority of the passenger planes should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
The present electronic devices give in general considerably less radio radiation than former generations.
E-Reader give for example only minimum radiation if one umblättert.
However, in the case of the download or sending of data the transmission parameters are stronger.
Amazon.com numbers among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions on the device use through passengers.
In 2011 company employees loaded a passenger plane fuller Kindle E-Reader and did a test flight in order to determine problems, could not arrest, however, any.
Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings, which concerns to the risk during the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he thinks, the trouble through the devices is really even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only occasional reports by pilots who would speak for a trouble from airplane systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices in the case of instrument landing under bad view relations through the passengers.
A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and referred as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be endowed with technique today extensively.
„We are pleased with the FAA recognizing that a pleasant passenger experience does not stand contrary to the security said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

But the watching is worthwhile in spite of that.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the clubs keeps on being handiwork.
Because: Schwarzwälder hams is to be found traditional without bones in the shelves.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo of a "submarine" optically.
The trick: Fir branches guarantee here in the smoke for the special taste of the black forests ham.
Finally 20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo jet", it announces the Test-Verspeisung.
"That one is correctly delicious", so the upshot of the TV star.
In this way all participants involved will be able to live.
Joy city: Fast actions überrumpeln hosts
With a narrow cadre the gentlemen I of the TSV joy city in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian one nightmare had to line up.
The Älbler stood indeed with a practised team on the other net page
Soon it was proved however, that they could completely not keep up, also age-conditional, with the fast actions of the joy town-dwellers.
With the hard and placed impacts the Gönninger did themselves extremely heavily.
Repeated they missed that of Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly above the net middle passed passports and attacks and were not during the block defense to the place.
Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly the superiority of the joy town-dwellers in all interests
Faced with this crushing and game-determining achievement the third sentence was gained then a little laxly and listlessly to the 3:0 closing balance (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There a considerably more efficient opponent will stand on the 2nd November with the TV Baiersbronn which could continue in Nagold clearly on the field.
TSV joy city of I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams suited themselves in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn from Baiersbronn and opposite joy city.
You delivered a two-hour-match in a hard way umkämpftes.
Nervousness on both pages caused particularly with the case of the ball assumption errors and dot presents; also with the case of the passports the precision was now and then scare commodity and in some critical mock bullfights the overeagerness prevented the look for possible dot profits.
In this from the point of view of performance very much harmonious meeting the big physical use and a pleasant engagement of both teams was right in the TSV-team of Marcus Blasutto but altogether.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to bind the inhabitants early into the planning", mayor Jens Häußler started the civil information event for the flood control draft in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come into the municipality hall in order to make oneself explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express objections and to bring in ideas.
Häußler explained: The members of the district council make the final decisions.
The high tide water, the Gechingen on 15th May 2009, in an unprepared way struck, a drastic event that raised the question about protective measures for the future was, according to Häußler.
A river field investigation had been commissioned with the neighbor municipality Aidlingen which now is basis for the flood control draft in Gechingen.
"The protection most possible many plots' built on is the objective so Häußler.
Taken as a basis is the planning the protection from an aloud German meteorological service statistical all high tides waters to be expected 100 years.
The climate change is taken to into account through a 15 per cent surcharge.
In experts this with "HQ 100aKlima" is described.
The water masses, that had led 2009 in Gechingen to considerable damages, corresponded to a 1000-year long high tide water.
"There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", so Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros at which the municipality can reckon country subsidies at the level of about 70 percent must be invested in Gechingen.
Häußler referred, however, to there being only the promotion if an overall concept is transformed.
For this purpose the municipality is dependent onto the collaboration of the citizens.
An extensive planning and permission procedure must be completed.
Most at best the conversion can be begun with in 2016.
Among other things the protection concept sees, which was presented already in the last week in the district council (we told) local measures in the influx of the rivulet Irm from the Stammheimer valley in front of
After the presentation of the flood control draft the participants took the opportunity for bringing in their requests.
Among other things was questioned, why more dams and moving hold basins are not planned to the protection of the place.
Gregory Kühn, compartment planner of the charged engineering office forest and Corbe from hill home that presented the draft stressed that it requires the co-ordination of all presented measures in order to reach the wanted objective in the sum.
In addition one is held to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald of forest and Corbe.
There was annoyance with adjoining owners of the old place who have to suffer from an overloading of the sewer network again and again even in the case of normal thunderstorm rain.
The problem is known during the administration and first measures were already taken.
Häußler referred, however, to the guidelines being others for channel systems than for the flood control and this must not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to lay out the sewer network so that rain events two to three year long could be verkraftet.
To dimension the sewers in a larger way would entwine to millions.
The again designed Opschlag shines with a new Cafe.
One that invites to the staying and returning.
One which would like to turn the name into the program.
One refers as Déjà Vu according to lexicon to a psychological phenomenon that the feeling is shown in by having experienced a new situation already once or seen.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve within sight to the college Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-Gefühl.
Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to the objective to make an actual stay not only intellectual but solidly always recurringly erlebbar.
Because it does now fun and simply beautiful is.
A look into the inner life at the Opschlag 8 gives the observer immediately a good feeling.
The café-ambience state-of-the-art, but not cool looks like a place for the feeling well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van of the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with most different coffee or cocktail variants.
For this purpose there are delicious cake or individually busy fresh French loaves.
The holders both 33 years old, made already before the opening of the neat café at the Opschlag as gastronomes a name: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
The agreeable café-lovers expect more public from the move after Kleve onto the Opschlag.
Last but not least also through the college
"At what we do not have any certain target group" stress Daniel Büttner.
Rather here young students would like to speak to the two just the same as seniors and all age groups between that.
Apropos café-lover.
The agreeable holder pair stands behind the coffee-pleasure
Enjoy the smelling hot brew in the most different variations themselves.
Expressofan
The Expresso fan and Mirjam van of the Stelt is Daniel Büttner rather the cappuccino alcoholic.
"For this purpose a French loaf - that is my thing, the NRZ betrays it".
There were already two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor celebration occurred really rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not profit by that.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
The two 33-year long ones found, "beautiful, successful and witty".
But now not Everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is not also therefore an expressed fan of event-evenings: "One can do it really now not all right".
And with an event I always speak only to the ones who are interested also in the specific event.
Therefore events will rather be the exception with us.
"We would like to interrupt the very normal company so little as possibly".
Is supposed to mean Déjà Vu stands also for reliability.
With respect to the quality of the products that are offered here, in the same way, as onto the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
To the street which develops more and more to itself into a gastronomy mile.
For the joy of a lot of Klever, the guests' from near and far and the students', that the guest Rome hurry and so that also the café Déjà Vu discover for themselves.

Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in view of great orders about seat width
Between leading airplane manufacturers it resulted in a quarrel over the width of seats in the tourist class with the case of long-distance flights what gives the clay to Dubai Airshow for a bitter collision on that one this month.
The quarrel turns around the seat width that is offered to passengers in the case of long flights in the tourist class – not always those ones, airlines make an effort for those ones the most, however, this shown room puts SAS and Boeing Co the key from airbus for the efficiency claims at the newest airplanes. dar.
Airbus required this week a branch standard, one seat-wide of at least 46 cm (18 customs) in the tourist class specifies, however, the US American ore rival Boeing says the airlines should decide on that.
The quarrel comes to a time since the airplane cages compete for selling even greater versions of their zweimotorigen long stretch airmen and expect record tasks of the 17th to 21st November during the event.
How the rear part of the airplane is built up – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is decisive for the indicated economical results which the new „mini-jumbo jet design „is supposed to supply.
Boeing says his modernized „777X" grabs 406 persons near seats in the tourist class that more than 17 customs are wide and allow so ten per row
Airbus declares, the concurrent version of the A350 carries 350 persons in 18 customs wide seats in the tourist class with the case of which there are nine per row
Airplane giants distribute frequently blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will probably do the race.
Recently the enterprise presented an advertisement which are the beginning of a new advertisement war can and financiers a picture showed, in which three persons are squashed in a restaurant, and for this purpose the title: „You would accept that"?
„Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats which are narrower than regional Turbo-Props", says airbus marketing leader John Leahy.
Faced with changed feeding habits the people become fatter, however, airplane seats did not change radically.
Between the early 1970ern, than the Boeing defined the modern long stretch journey in 747, and to the at the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
The waist extent of the masculine average American in the 21st century is according to US American health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival sticks to a seat draft from the 1950ern when the average body extent of the freshly christened „jet set" was narrower.
One has carried on, so airbus, investigations, the busy ones, that one additional customs (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality around 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers of airbus to the seat measures and says, to decide in the discretion of the manufacturers how airlines arrange the balance between flight rates and equipment it does not stand.
The enterprise also declares according to investigations the experience hangs in the airplane from more than the seat width.
„It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do that what they according to their opinion must in order to be successful" the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing explains.
You would not like, that we dictate to them what makes it profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else does.
For passengers it is a question of more elbow-room, but for manufacturers it becomes in increasing measure a topic which can affect the turnovers
Behind the quarrel a race stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion United States dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the USA or Europe lastingly
As Reuters in July for the first time reported, the seat layout is the floating strength behind the quarrel around the new jets.
Both airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with the case of their newest zweimotorigen long stretch designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige of Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings for the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in that one in 777.
The climbed costs per unit are still smaller than at currently used machines with ten seats per row
„Boeing squashes therefore more seats into his airplane in order to turn it into our product more competitively", says Kevin Keniston, conductor for passenger comfort at the European airbus.
On the other hand analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at available 777s indicated that many passengers decided for the narrower order, what could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates.
„Eighteen customs seat width would be fabulous for passengers, however the reality is: from an economical point of view the airbus-offer headed" from the threat" "through the 777 of them", says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin equipment Gründerin and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer any seats, but a catalog of subcontractors which the airlines can select from.
The world-traveling jet sales assistants bear even measuring tape with themselves in order to measure the equipment with the case of the competition
Even if they recommend the comfort nevertheless all manufacturers offer also jets with highly condensed arranging for cheap airlines and regional flights so.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows did not sell, however, yet any according to own statement
Until recently airbus showed how more adaptability of the cabins is importantly and wide seats demanded for some jets at the walks
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of big modern jets experts say that the call after a new branch standard will presumably blow up, but could turn away from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen.
The Veganismus is subordinated to the vegetarianism according to lexicons, distinguishes from this, however, nevertheless in very considerable way
Because while vegetarians are allowing themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam cheese, these Schlemmereien do not stand on the menu of a Veganers.
Milk, the Veganer lets cheeses, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish of the all consumption of animal products off - also honey is denied.
One likes to wonder what remains, however, in the case of nearer consideration the vegane feeding world is characterized by a considerable imaginativeness.
"Spreads are very popular", declares Ute Henkelmann, the holder of the local health food store who prepares a great number of specific products for Veganer.
Also Reuben Proctor goes to the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.
For 13 years the native New Zealander is living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) all which he needs to the life. "In 1997 I changed my feeding and Vegetarier became".
Around the turn of the century then the next step occurred and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came, however, not only because of the feeding but due to the shoe choice", says Proctor who prefers imitation leathers to normal leather.
He recognized that it works also in other everyday interests without animal products.
In the first place is vegan be an ethic.
"I do not want animals to have to die for me" expresses the maxim of the Veganer which applies to the entire consumer behavior Proctor.
To mourn instead of Burgern, Rühreiern or rubber bears, the Veganer discovered quickly very new products that enthusiasm increased at.
"It is a double bonus", says Proctor today, "in fact sets vegan be no renunciation no asceticism dar, but it is an enrichment". Proctor rather puts down the assumption that one reduces the selection with the feeding adaptation at food options to the power of the habit.
And exactly these conditionings let also some still so well-meant attempt fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor, which makes many be given up quickly, similarly as while smoking", Proctor sets up a comparison.
And objects: "Certain tastes are not to be identified with the animal".
Often it is the spices or the kind of the dressing which define the taste.
"One can produce, however, the same effect also in another manner", the Veganer clarifies.
For a barbecue Proctor brings along for example aubergines, champignons and also a few Veganwürste.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied feeding with the case of which it is absolutely supposed to taste also once solid.
Of course one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
"It is supposed to taste good, but that is not to reduce" only to animal food", according to Proctor.
He did not suffer sanitary damages up to Essstörungen, a further widespread assumption
For me the adaptation had a positive aspect.
I do not incorporate any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin part.
There are high performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are at best, I make myself be often checked", Proctor betrays.
Many Vegansimus-critics warn in particular against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with fodders instead of grazing on the pasture it is questionable whether in the meat which one buys in the freezer the vitamin-B12-part is high", thinks Proctor.
For Veganer there is furthermore the possibility to take the co-enzyme in shape of trays to himself
"My B12-values are in order", it declares.
Widens ways must go Proctor for the food procurement not.
Finally there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has in the meantime soya milk and other products.
I find all which I need on site.
Only now and then I buy something specific.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive now, but so it also behaves near usual finished products as is generally known".
Anyhow the dressing of veganer courts is by far more favorable and less time-consuming than gemeinhin accepted.
"In the house kitchen it gives to discover a lot, with a few small tricks can one good if results not in part better achieve" Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his veganen cheesecakes could bring also his parents-in-law to Proctor to the astonishment.
The Veganer gives a new spice to family celebrations.
That has dynamics, if one cooks together, that has a new significance.
"The situations which in this case can arise are as different as the people themselves" are, says Proctor.
Of course skepticism was already evinced for it however.
Does my food not like to you anymore?
"I am supposed to feel now bad because I drink milk"? - with the case of such kinds of questions one must act as Veganer with intuition.
"I do not refuse the people, I am a part of this society Proctor would not like to survive any enclave existence.
And the everyday life world does not appear in a more exact way considered then at all as veganfremd as presumed - and the Veganer not restricted so in the everyday life as gemeinhin accepted.
Also Fast Food is allowed.
There are chips everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer Falafel, or now a vegetarian Yufka", Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he switches to paste courts or orders now a pizza without cheeses, everything a question of the habit.
The restaurants appear so slowly on that.
"When I 13 years ago started eating vegan, everything was still much more difficult", the New Zealander can make a development ausfindig: "One must talk to the people, make it attentive on that".
"If sufficient demands come, they are inclined maybe in order to complement the menu" it hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, as for example the galley into Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor cherishes the wish, that also other restaurants have stood at least a veganes court on the menu.
Basically vegane courts are for all of them there.
Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of excluding.
"On the other hand meat dishes are excluding, and indeed in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others" Proctor finds.
"If one wants to avoid food scandals, Veganismus is then a secure way to make the biggest part from the beginning impossible", says Proctor.
The purchase of veganer products can be, however, at the beginning a little difficult.
Contain that also into peanuts, in particular when one learns to understand, animal additives as color donors his can, one seems the courage to leave with the compliance of the ethic near so many hurdles and traps quickly.
Not only therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal contents materials and their alternatives" explains the many contents materials that Food- however also detergents are buried.
"Little by little one develops a scanner look and white, to which signs and logos one has to pay attention It is" Proctor "to do small steps sometimes better than to conk out or to stumble," white.
The Veganismus, he is an important moral hint that beats onto the consciousness.
Maybe it does completely not manage that one puts aside his habits, however, at least it can teach the consumer to question his habits critically
Bavaria's basketball player in spite of first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not curtail the gigantic optimism to Bavaria Munich with the basketball players of the FC.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning also against the best team of Europe of the last two years" bilanzierte Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) at the Thursday evening with title defender of Olympiakos of Piräus.
We sent the message: Also in Munich basketball exists!
At theirs first third appearance in the European royal class sold the inhabitants of Munich long very good, were in the decisive phases not clarified, however, simply enough.
The guests created the trick first of all, still to convert some 15-point remains into a leadership 13 minutes for end before Piräus gave a turn to the game once again.
"We fought us incredibly back against the double Euroleague champion, done, however, then again frivolous errors Bavarian pro Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our achievement but we want to gain every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the inhabitants of Munich who had celebrated clear victories in the first two lots against the Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine-vaccine could do the Garaus to the pleasure with the case of the smoking
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine-vaccine which could spoil the fun at the smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could long protect mice against nicotine addiction a life.
For tests at the human being even further attempts are needed which can last still some years, however, professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
„We are very hopeful, that this kind can help millions of smokers that attempted to stop and in this case all methods available on the market tried out, but that had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches from vaccinating-strategy once", so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was changed so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine-antibodies.
The virus infects selectively the liver cells which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain through which a smoker does not find out any Nikotin-High.
In attempts vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given retained their normal activity level.
Mice without inoculation on the other hand would have taken a „time-out", declared the researchers, a sign, for the nicotine reaching their brain.
The experiments are described in the technical journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The inoculations had to be given for the maintaining of the antibody turn-off level so frequently that they were expensive and impractical.
Nevertheless the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it changes liver cells into antibody factories.
As professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be given to children for people if it is sure before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent so nicotine addiction
It is more probable, however, that smokers would use it in order to stop.
„You know then: If they resume smoke, they do not feel any pleasure anymore in this case because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them with putting aside the habit" it explains.
British scientists said, the results are interesting, they warned, however, simultaneously, it even further research is necessary.
Guillaume Nicloux' Adaptation of the novel of Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, also heavier food is, however, than necessary.
The action playing in the France of the 1760th years tells the moving history of Suzanne, a young noble that is sent to the cloister by their family.
When it rebels, it is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic hospital matron and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lasciviousness or sensation pleasure – and in that his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told turns it also for the public into the quälerischen penitential robe.
Egypt vereidigt first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the office oath, however, his day of the triumph might not mean the end of the political quarrels in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a „new Egypt", than he was vereidigt as a first freely elected president of the country and in this way the succession of Husni Mubarak lined up that 16 months before had been marketed from the office.
With his inauguration in front of the uppermost constitution court Mursi became fifth head of state also to the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arabian world and Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which has his seat at the Nile and an antiquated Egyptian nachempfunden temple is.
„We move to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", said Mursi during the solemn ceremony which was transferred live in the state television.
„Heute put the Egyptian nation the foundation for a new life –" the 60-year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim brotherhood, of a fundamentalist group that had been taken into the visor by the respective government since their foundation 84 years ago mostly as prohibited organization sharply said „absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, as Mursi shortly to eleven o'clock local time in a small car convoy arrived.
Only a few hundreds of supporters had met before the court in order to cheer to the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor from the Mubarak-time the traffic was stopped only on a short-term basis so that the car convoy could cross the usually animated street that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
Mocked as an" uncharismatic „spare wheel" of the brotherhood his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, at which it not only as a candidate of the Islamisten, but all of this whom these presented, that wanted to bring the attempts of the revolt onto the objective from the year 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
„Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state", declared the Mursi dressed in a blue suit with red tie the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the office oath.
Later Mursi went to the university from Cairo, where it should hold his inaugural address.
It was welcomed officially by an army chapel who played the national anthem to whom he listened in Habachtstellung.
The military leader field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
With the case of his arrival he was welcomed from hundreds of person presents in the biggest lecture hall of the university with speaking choruses of „The army and the nation are a hand".
The university of Cairo founded in the year 1908 as a bastion of secular education developed in the 1970th years into a stronghold of Islamic student groups.
Mursi took on Friday a symbolic oath on the Tahir-place to zurückfordern the birth place of the revolt that led last year at the end of the authoritarian domination, and vowed to Mubaraks presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of state hunted from the office.
Nevertheless with the storing of the official oath in front of the court and not as usually before the parliament bows down it the will of the military, what refers to the power fight going on.
Mursis speech on the Tahir-place was fuller dramatic populists gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as singers Hubert Wermters is history near the man choral society Cäcilia as those of the Herbsfestes in whose frames he was honored solemnly almost twice for so long.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his man choral society on the stage.
Also after 60 years the singing with the choir meanwhile presumably more than dearly gained does him still great fun.
In the association Wermter was also active among other things 28 years long as a member of the committee.
For his engagement and his association faith he received now several distinctions: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented a document of the association and an honor letter signed by bishop Gebhard Fürst to him - since the choir is also a choir.
His singer colleagues presented the document of the German choir association as well as an engraved stannic plate to him.
Next to the honor the 31st fall celebration proceeded in usual railways: With the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singer department bay-singing and the local music association the Vollmaringer had loaded a colored mixture of different choirs and song styles which the about 400 visitors maintained.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmosphere-full songs as "In the wine paradise" and "Merry, you brothers".
They prepared another small serenade for your honor singer Hubert Wermter for the honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "Federal song".
The man choral society Betra sang also classical choir songs as "Hunter-advertising" of Julius Wengert, "Wide, far away" from Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "when you go through through the valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten guaranteed with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulse choir - for the woman rate of the celebration.
The mixed choir kidnapped Gus into foreign countries with the Neapolitan nation manner "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos while the "impulse choir was grasping also foreign languages back: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger club came "to the Schwob" with "Something isch"? of Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Beer song" again back into domestic fields, where the Vollmaringer music association offered the crowning musical end.
For the children there was a small side programme - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Punch theater and read out a few histories which the children the noon over well busy.
Statute labor animal Airlines raises fees for Handgepäck
Statute labor animal Airlines intends to demand up to 100 United States dollars from passengers who would like to pack hand luggage on their flight.
Statute labor animal Airlines intends, to charge hand luggage and 2 dollars a piece for up to 100 United States dollars for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers might keep the whole can.
The new fee is valid for hand luggage in the luggage locker above the seat, small bags under the seat keep on being free.
Statute labor animal declared one calculates 25 United States dollars if the fee in advance is paid and 100 United States dollars with travellers that paid first at the gate.
Statute labor animal speaker cottage O'Malley said, the fee of 100 United States dollars is aimed at persuading travellers to see to the payment previously.
„We would not like to calculate this sum", it declared.
Airlines began in 2008 with demanding fees for the first and second piece of luggage given up.
Passengers that attempted to go around these stuffed therefore so much as possibly into the hand luggage, which results in the consequence that the luggage lockers are frequently full above the seat.
Fees are a possibility to convince passengers of that less to take Bord.
O'Malley said with the case of the new fee it is really not a question of earning money.
It is a question of the most loyal customers of statute labor animal to have expressed clearly that it becomes increasingly heavier to find place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers do not have to pay that buy your tickets on the web site of the airline.
That means that a passenger may take along a piece of luggage freely from statute labor animal possibly at the gate, the next person, however, must pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley declared the web site of statute labor animal and the Check-in-Verfahren would be changed so that the passengers are informed of the fee before they would come to the gate.
The new hand luggage fee of statute labor animal does not come into force before in the summer, there is not an exact date yet.
Passengers swear frequently about baggage surcharges and other fees however, airlines fall back gladly to that.
You argue, that the transportation of the baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it
Many at the rampart Street consider the new baggage fees as signs for the airlines taking enough money in order to cover the costs of air trips after years of the losses.
Most let up to now the fingers of fees however, for Handgepäck.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as First Fees for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap airman followed.
The single other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared the Airline-Berater Jay Sorensen who pursues the addition fees attentively.
He reckoned in a report by December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit is 50 million United States dollars worth annually.
Sorensen that formerly held a leadership position with Midwest Airlines flew recent with Spirit and was curious, what it at the gate would expect, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the enterprise.
„The Boarding-process belonged to the smoothest which I experienced in my career in the aviation", he said.
I expected to see tooth crunching and obvious discussions at the gate.
„The airplane was full", it declared, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated."
Statute labor animal follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars which are demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The enterprise declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice might keep the whole can and coffee is refilled gratis.
Water keeps on being free.
US Airways had attempted in 2008 on a short-term basis to demand money for soft drinks, this made however, seven months later again declining, after passengers had complained and had tightened no other large society
Statute labor animal's step, to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly near the airline is the recent initiative with which customers are supposed to be directed to the own web site.
Airlines pay online travel agencies as Orbitz 10 to 25 United States dollar per sold ticket.
That provides all societies with a stimulus, to convince passengers of the direct purchase with them instead of above an online travel agency.
Statute labor animal is widest in this field however, gone.
In September the enterprise began with assigning so much Vielfliegermeilen in the case of booking about an online travel agency only still half.
On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again on 25 percent of the flight stretch
An air trip booked with a third provider with statute labor animal above 1000 miles is only another 250 miles to customers worth therefore.
Passengers can reserve also exclusively places during the direct purchase on the web site of statute labor animal.
Statute labor animal has a loyal clientele at his seat in Denver, nevertheless the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.
The proceeds decreased about 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank just 13 percent in the first quarter as in the financial statement is to read that on Wednesday of the mother company group, Republic Airways holding companies Inc was published..

Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the pupils of the Black Forest grammar school became acquainted with the American New York city.
After eight hours of flight it started now to the Brooklyn Bridge over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here already a fascinating look was offered onto the world-famous skyline which defines a special charm in the evening light.
Through the delay the pupils were almost 24 hours on the legs, however truly the motto "The city does not sleep the day was concluded at the Times Square.
In spite of shutdown the Statue of Liberty with a ferry boat could be reached on the second day and climbed up on foot.
Afterwards it went over the finance center around the rampart Street to the memorial place of the 11th September.

After that it went over the Rockefeller center to the Central Park who offered an ideal occasion for the short staying in the fall sun through the hectic driving of the New York streets.
Meanwhile after a short flight from New York to Boston the pupils arrived in their guest families and experience at the Weymouth High School the school everyday life.
For national and international investors no way moves the Germany immovable location past.
The economical frame data are right, and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th immovable day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German property markets profit by the economical strength and the economic general conditions good in the European comparison in the country.
On that Christian Ulbrich referred CEO Europe, Near East and Africa of Jones along LaSalle on the 9th immovable day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As searchedly German trade immovables are, the look points at the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year it hotted up the pace in comparison with the previous year section around 31%.
In Great Britain the plus was only near 6%, in France, at 19%.
"Immovable investments offer an attractive interest payment rate", said Ulbrich.
The net yield distance between immovables and federal loans is on a historically high level.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in the case of tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose corpse was found in a wrestler mat rolled up in the gymnasium of his High School are convinced, the attorney of the family declared that their son was murdered on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US American Georgia Federal state was found on the 11th January in a mat uprightly set up which stood behind the bleacher in the school gymnasium.
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes county came to the conclusion, that Johnson died at a tragic accident, which the family of that 17-year, however, doubts.
„You are convinced from that of their son being murdered", declared Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed, he died so as the sheriff concluded it.
„You think that it lacks every logic against which expels laws of the physics as also against the healthy human intellect", according to Crump.
Rather they are convinced, the truth is hushed up in order to protect the person or persons that are responsible for the death of their son.
It comments, „your son went for the learning into the school and came in the corpse bag back".
US public prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal determination for the death of Johnsons since a series of important questions are still unclear.
What was the death cause?
Is his death to be put down to a crime?
That declared bogs at a press conference in the Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, to which direction they also lead.
It is my objective to find out the truth.
„I represent the opinion that a sufficient basis exists for a formal determination he said.
Moore declared opposite reporters the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson had passed away at the consequences of a „position-conditional suffocation".
A second autopsy showed, however, another death cause, according to Moore.
„There is a series of questions which must be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added, if there are sufficient proofs of a legal or civil law investigation for the death of Johnsons, he will charge the FBI the realization of the investigations.
A representative of the authority of the county to sheriffs was open our inquiry to the Thursday there not immediately ready for a comment.

John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission the US espionage went inappropriately too far
A softening of the defensive attitude of the USA with respect to their monitoring programs programs pointed out to John Kerry with an unexpected admission when he said, the espionage went in certain cases inappropriately too far.
The foreign minister of State in addition admitted it would bear together with Barack Obama the responsibility for one switching to „autopilot" when the explosive disclosures of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden became public about the espionage activities of the NSA.
Through the seeped information the US government is into a diplomatic storm of the indignation vonseiten their ally guessed.
With the case of a speech transmitted by video connection on the Open Government-Konferenz in London Kerry said: „Completely without question the president and I as well as others in the government heard about some things that ran as it were by autopilot simple because the ability for this purpose existed, what still onto the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War as well as natural on the 11th September goes back."
Afterwards he admitted as a first hochrangiges member of the US American government that the US espionage crossed a border it also stressed, however, that no rights were misused.
He said: „In some cases that went inappropriately too far."
The president is decided to create clearness and carries out therefore a thorough investigation so that nobody has to have the feeling here abuse occurs.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not influenced in this process
Kerry insisted, however, on the NSA being a strength of the good one and many lives being saved by their monitoring processes.
He added: „We have to do it with a new world in which people are ready to blow oneself up."
It gives blowing up a radical extremism in the world to which on that it is crazy to kill people and attacking governments.
What would that be to be caught therefore if one was in the situation and stopped before it happens?
We prevented in fact aircraft crashes assaults on buildings and the assassination from people because we heard about such plans previously.
Meanwhile US American legislators around which objection declared against the alleged American espionage to scatter and to convince the Europeans of the necessity to keep on cooperating with the USA at the anti-terror efforts as the chairperson of the senate sub-committee for European matters on Thursday will travel to Europe.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut did not tell about the supervision anymore it spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is worried because of their threats due to the frustration through the National Security Agency at anti-terror organizations involve.
„It is very important for the national security interests of the USA, that the Europeans with regard to our common efforts against the terrorism with stay on board", declared Murphy that is as a democrat for the first time in the senate and is active for non-resident relationships and European matters as a chairperson of the senate sub-committee in an interview in Washington.
In addition I go to Europe in order to explain there that we keep on having to cooperate in the terror abatement despite their trouble at the NSA-programs.
Media reports according to which the NSA entered millions of telephone data in Europe have to unite the relationships US allies loads, although the conductor of the secret service declared this week, the reports are incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadatas that were collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures summoned from documents passed on by Snowden after which the NSA controlled the mobile worldwide of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 more heads of state.
The conductor of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allies as necessary and declared this is usual on both pages
In all the tumult Murphy said his authority prepares the journey of the congress which is supposed to occur this year, and hoped, the delegation will contain members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating representatives are supposed to be published in the coming days.
He said, that exact itinerary is still elaborated.
While Murphy was stressing the purpose of the journey is the improvement of the relationships, it spoke also of there being some „serious words".
He said the European governments would have to be honest opposite their population about the kind of espionage programs which they used even for years.
„Indeed we can change our monitoring programs programs and so the rights of the Europeans protect better, these must come also with the fact that we are not the only ones that spies to terms, however," so Murphy.
Meanwhile a journey into the Near East and to poles waits for John Kerry at the weekend in order to deal with the grudge there about the US American strategy into Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US American supervision activities.
Child dreams become true
The kindergartens and day nurseries in the Zollernalbkreis get in these days mail office.
The black forests' messenger would like in cooperation with Bauhaus and support the facilities to the savings bank Zollernalb in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sand box
All kindergartens, day nurseries and creches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can Join in with the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment wish for your equipment you keep yourself up this at the black forests messengers apply.
Are creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
Which conditions for the participation there are?
The wish should be able to be realized with building material to the value of at the most 2000 euros and at one (Aktions-) day.
In addition the winner must guarantee even for many industrious construction helpers.
What has it with the action day and the helpers on themselves?
Bauhaus provides the material with support of the savings bank Zollernalb.
It is supplied on the agreed day into the kindergarten and is supposed to be processed then directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer says prime minister Tony Abbott has interest conflict at the parent vacation
The billionaire and representative Clive Palmer says prime minister Tony Abbott would stand in an interest conflict with the case of his plans to the parent vacation because his daughters become pregnant and could profit by that therefore.
The mining industry tycoon who is in a judicial quarrel about the payment of 6 million dollars onto CO2 steering wheels made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions whether it would be in a conflict from the table.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four voices in the senate that are important for the decision whether the CO2- and be deleted to mining industry taxes or abbreviated.
However, Palmer said that only ministers could have interest conflicts and the daughters would profit by Abbott personally from the laws.
„It is in a great interest conflict if it is a question of paid parent vacation, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in that, whether she receives vacation or not", Palmer said.
The choice commission Palmer with 53 voices declared two months after the choice to the new counting officially according to projection to the winner of the Sunshine-Coast-Sitzes of fair fax.
Palmer demanded a reworking of the process for the voice counting so that this goes ahead more quickly.
Tony of Abbotts of daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these choices be decided on two months according to the end of the voice delivery
„We need a better system", he said.
Why should we not have any system with the case of which one marches, enters the data in a computer, chooses immediately and has the result then at 6:30 o'clock in the evening?
Palmer criticized also the use of pencils in the event of the marking of the ballot papers.
Does one use it because one, when one does not like them, can erase the results?
To vote nowadays with pencils is incredible.
The choice commission examined the options for an electronic choice and published recently a common law proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that an international airport belongs to his politics for the Sunshine Coast and that it will take his new office „very seriously".
With the case of a public office it is a question of the service at the public.
„We do not strive for any reward except for that of the history indeed, that we can be used in a critical time of this community", he said.
Esa decides on great space missions: Missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts of the European space travel agency must agree now on two large projects which want to start it in the next years.
30 proposals were selectable, five are still in the running.
Far worlds.
Astronomers already found more than 1000 planets at other stars.
No one knows whether at least there are lives on some of them.
The selection is difficult: Is one supposed to search for gravitational waves?
Or investigating the origin of the cosmos more gladly?
Or searching for earth-similar planets and discovering maybe extraterrestrial life in this way?
These questions are just asked to the European space travel agency Esa the persons responsible in charge.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they search ideas for two great space travel projects which are supposed to voranbringen the research decisively.
The budget for such "l-missions" is in each case about instance near a billion euros.
The start will be 2028 and 2034 probable.
At the beginning of September the elite of the European astrionics met in Paris, around proposals for such missions to discuss.
30 ideas were under discussion, five of them were short-listed now.
Numerous committees examine the proposals haken with the researchers after.
In the next days a final decision is supposed to fall through the scientific program committee.
The Esa onto which the missions of the program "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007 are supposed to find Answers selected in total four great questions.
What are the conditions for the origin of planets and lives?
The exact processes during the formation of stars from big gas clouds - and in this way also the origin of planets that circle these stars - lie still in the proverbial darkening.
A big infrared telescope in the space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under which circumstances life can arise there?
In order to follow this question, the space telescope "Cheops" with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined in our nearer surroundings in a more exact way is supposed to start in 2017.
The possibilities are, however, restricted, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With bigger instruments the astronomers could show earth-similar planets and analyze them even the composition of their atmospheres and search them so according to "Biomarkern": To gases which are valid as an index for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
Also this question is supposed to give ultimately information about which conditions there are for the origin of lives.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation going out of it with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa granted already a mission of the M-class (there the budget is near about instance half a billion of euros) for this question.
The probe is supposed to start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.
From great interest in the researchers also Jupiter and his moons are.
You want to find out which role the giant planet played during the development of the solar system.
For that the Esa plans the first of the in total three L-missions of the "Cosmic vision"-program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probably begins their journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The cosmos offers many possibilities, matter to study under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether the natural laws, known to us, are still valid there.
Maybe also deviations which could show the way for a new theory under whose roof all known natural laws can be united to the physicists are found.
How did the universe arise and of what does it consist
Before 13.7 billion years our cosmos arose through the Urknall.
Next to the matter, us common, from the stars, planets and living beings how we withstand, there are Dark matter whose force of gravity galaxies and galaxy heaps hold together, and Dark Energy, the expansion of the cosmos at an accelerated rate through their work.
Neither up to now the researchers do not know yet which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Urknalls from which withstand Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa granted also here already a M-mission whose start is planned for 2020.
With a specific telescope the distribution of the matter is supposed to examine the probe for the first time in the universe at the entire sky and facilitate so inferences onto the state of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
Who could do the race
From the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection method.
"E-Lisa", a pretentious draft has the best chances on an approval as a L-mission in opinion of many experts as proof of gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of the room time by that, the Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago had predicted.
They were not proved until today.
Elisa could create that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes which is stationed in the space.
It could prove unlike installations on the earth also gravitational waves which arose with the case of the Urknall, and supply so new findings about the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals still compete for the second L-mission: a big X-ray telescope by the name of "Athena" that is supposed to explore among other things black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" that earth-similar planets trace and that is supposed to examine.
Already proposals for the test return transport of the Mars, for the exploration, dropped out among other things of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for the sun physics.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday those ones published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a series of guidelines for the contact with food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines which the US American government handed over since the number of the school ages children with food allergies climbs.
One thing of 20 children in the United States has meanwhile a food allergy.
The circulation of food allergies among children increased according to CDC around 18 percent in between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are supposed to wake a consciousness with the staff and the employees for food allergies and that is supposed to be handled as with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in an in stock way – the car-injection of the brand EpiPen is used most frequently – in order to be able to encounter a potentially fatal Überempfindlichkeitsreaktion.
The legislators in the Federal states changed recently the rules so that schools Epinephrin in a more simply in stock way can hold.
In the report also a list is contained typical symptoms that are named by children that show an allergic reaction.
Maybe children say: „It feels as if something presses onto my tongue My tongue feels, as if a hair lies on that" or „My tongue itches".
Fire department called for the rescue of a doggie which was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a smaller road accident
Three days later it was discovered by a stroller in the quarry in their awkward situation
Fire department people let themselves down onto cliff and saved the dog in front of that secure death
The fire department succeeded in saving a doggie which was stuck on a 15 meters high projection in a cliff.
The nine months old cocker spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a road accident in the Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 which the dog belongs to came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, west Yorkshire, in order to receive Ruby again and to thank the fire department people of the west Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service.
You had despaired after their missing bitch searched and cries for help in social networks publishes when she had escaped into the quarry after the small road accident.
About instance by 14:15 o'clock on Wednesday a stroller that took out his dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high sale in the quarry, saw.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the place and let itself down for the rescue Rubys which then was transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: „It was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the cliff - 15 meters of above and to the ground removes.
It did not move any muscle during their rescue – she had been cold as stiffly.
However, now she is fine.
She ate afterwards a few dog cakes.
That was a quite unusual use
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: „Ruby had a giant luck."
The possibility withstood it, that it was very heavy hurt or Worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to the investigation which, however, did not arrest anything except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, west Yorkshire, said: „To watch during the rescue was frightening."
I could not believe at all that it was really there above
It was wonderful to hold it again in the arms.
The veterinarian declared if the exhaustion had become too great and had collapsed, it would presumably have fallen.
The fire department people achieved splendid one.
It was really courageous, which they did.
We are simply so thankful and everyone of them was completely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: „We were afraid, that it would fall down, but stayed above
The fire department people were splendid.
I can hardly believe where it was.
US border "Super-tunnel" discovered for the drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the USA observers discovered and deactivated a "super-tunnel" for the drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities informed, the more than 500 meters long tube was endowed with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilating system between Tijuana and San Diego.
Three suspects were arrested accordingly, confiscated eight tons of marihuana as well as almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not been taken according to the information in use yet.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could "durchgraben" under the radar" the general state attorney of the US district Southern California, Laura Duffy said, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turned onto the drug gangs Duffy insured: "If your wide builds such tunnels and attempts to use it, we are decided to turn that into a gigantic waste of your dirty money".
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous-fight against the drug cartels.
Since became 2006 in Mexico more than killed to 77th 000 people in connection with the drug criminality.
Constructed by experts
Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel the observers assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction used about a year.
The railway construction siding track was so equipped, that there electrical practiced cars could be used.
On Mexican page the access lies in a building which is 80 meters of the border away.
According to authorities a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entry
The tunnel has a cross-section view of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters of width.
It would have been also suitable with in order to support the illegal immigration direction of USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine-find.
The third parties party, a Mexican, were grabbed because of the confiscated marihuana.
Lifelong deprivation of liberty threatens all dreien as maximum penalty as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it kept on being said on the press conference in San Diego.
It is, however, the first time that in such a tunnel construction cocaine was found.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are meanwhile cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug search DEA in San Diego.
You would do everything in order to reach the USA.
To the arrested ones no details were announced, Mexikaner is to at least one, it was said.
You must reckon prison sentences up to ten years.
Obamas moving-snag in the healthcare policy
According to vehement criticism president Obama made yesterday a moving-snag with the case of his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: „If you like your health insurance, you can keep it then."
After Hunderttausende of their insurer received a written notice, the republicans reproached the president in the last days, it deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relocated his initial promise.
„They can keep the predominant majority of the citizens who have a functioning health insurance", he said with the case of a speech in Boston.
As reaction to the numerous media reports for the notices Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens can such a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorably than predicts receive.
„You come a better offer", he said.
The government referred to it as little surprising, that the five percent of the population that finished even an insurance according to another rate would have to look around, since their contract does not correspond to the new standards to the Affordable Care Act.
„I would like to say to these Americans very directly: You earned better one", said Sebelius with the case of a hearing in front of the energy and commercial sow shot of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius which is responsible for the conversion of the Affordable Care Acts declared that the start of the online-platform since October proceeded „miserably".
„I am also just as frustrated and furious as all others are", she said.
I am decided to recover your confidence.
This saying of an angry Sebelius to a consultant being behind it during the hearing of yesterday in the House of Representatives was incorporated after a quarrel conversation with the republican representative Billy Long from Missouri. In this case it worked around whether it should be obliged to the participation in Obamacare.
To finish after more than three hours of hearing badgered Long Sebelius repeatedly with the question why the „architect" of the Affordable Care Acts did not renounce a from a government viewpoint supported insurance voluntarily around even a rate at HealthCare.gov which she wants to sell to millions of Americans now.
Parents of intersexual children can choose „Sex indefinitely"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is acknowledged for children who were born with genitals not unequivocal
More is not assigned to newborns inflexibly manly or in a feminine way.
According to the new law parents do not have to explain any sex more for such children, but can indicate „indefinite" or „not defined" on the birth certificate.
It is an objective of the law to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make any rash decisions with respect to operations for a sex assignment with newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.
An intersexual person said years later according to BBC: „I am not either Mann or woman."
I remain the patchwork which was created by doctors, mutilated and full scars.
Approximately one thing does not come from 2,000 children to the world every year either as a boy or as girls.
You belong to the intersexual ones, a group that falls under the diagnosis „Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung" (DSD) a comprehensive term term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (Eierstöcken or testicles) or unusually genitals developed.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
The sense of the sex identification is not yet very well developed, nevertheless most experts recommend that in the USA, one is supposed to use the best available information to the sex assignment if a definition is not possible, and wait not for the psychological and physical development of the child, before one decides – when anyway – for an operation.
The New York psychiatrists' Dr. Jack Drescher who specialized on the problems natures of the sex identification said the new German law „rings to a good thing".
Intersexual Children represent an ethical dilemma.
„Some people have life-alarming illnesses which require a surgical intervention, however, that is not valid for most children", he said.
One can carry out a sex assignment without operation and wait for it then, as the identity develops.
The scientific data above how a child develops anyway his sexual identity are not very exactly.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It is as the secret why people are homosexual.
In a report onto the European commission from the year 2011 is called it, intersexual people are of transsexual or to distinguish Transgender persons, because their status is not sex-gotten, but necessitated by their biological constitution that neither is not feminine manly yet exclusively, but typically both simultaneously or not defined as one thing by that clearly.
These properties were proved in lower-level sexual characteristics as muscle measures, hairiness, breasts and stature, major sexual characteristics as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report gives also an overview of the discrimination, that intersexual and see Transgender persons abandoned in the professional life as well as about the extent of molestation, power and prejudice criminality.
Boys agreeing not with the sex picture have a specific camp now.
Meanwhile it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents masculine, feminine or to declare „third sex".
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as worldwide a first „sexless" person after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a sex status „not defined".
German identity cards have a third assignment, X for intersexual in the future next to M and W, according to the Ministry of the Interior Office.
In the adjacent France sex topics are still controversial, such a notification of message on France 24.
In 2011 French representatives of the severely Catholic country signed dozens a petition, that the „sex theory" is supposed to be removed from school books.
The US American web site Catholic Online spoke out also against the German law, with the reason: „If the world is dragged into a new state, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, however, not, then we twist two more columns of the civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared opposite baby zone she would find it better if a sex is assigned to babies at the birth.
„The parent existence is already stressful enough also without further restrictions especially if one" does not „know" the sex of the own child, she said to the parent web site.
Children need stability and security
Children were seen historical to, that both with masculine as also feminine genitals were given birth, than described to hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God that had both sexes.
Still ten years ago the medicine considered the sex as something which one can wipe out and establish again then.
Nevertheless meanwhile the ethical basics of an operation are doubted after now known is, how the sexual identity is in a complex way, and that doctors can be also wrong because they do not know how the child feels while growing up with the sex assigned by them.
„In the middle of the 20th century one mentioned that a ,psychiatrischen emergency" Drescher said.
If such a child was born, one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon then.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with genitals not unequivocal goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University who represented the opinion the sex is plastic.
It shaped the concept „sexual identity" and argued, social and environment-conditional impulses – as the parents bring up a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped so, whether a person considers herself as masculine or feminine.
However in a case become known under the title „John/Joan" from the year 1966 his theories became controversial.
He recommended the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a bungled curtailment completely to castrate the child and to remove also his testicles and to raise him then as a girl.
„Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he, however, was" not, according to Drescher.
As the boy about 15 was, it returned to the masculine sex and a woman got married.
With 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher there are still doctors who would practise this model.
However in the 1990th years, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations stepped onto the public that is not „happy with the result".
So about instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana that was born with XY-masculine chromosomes, however, ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about that, whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced, it can never lead a „satisfactory living" as a man.
Therefore his external organ and the testicles shortly after the birth 1976 were removed surgically and he was raised as a girl.
In the age of 12 he received feminine hormones.
„I knew that I am not a girl", it declared opposite ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really heavy to ask questions.
In the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic
Nevertheless since it was depressive and knew, that something was not right, it demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After his having found out the truth, he changed again for the masculine identity, received testosterone injections and made remove his breasts.
Through the operation he became infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization by the name of interface Project for intersexual people as normal being perceived.
However Anne Tamar-Mattis, manageress of the right group of Advocates for Informed Choice resident in californiums, worries, that the German law to the stamping and Stigmatisieren can encourage.
„Many activists are worried, that the German decision could encourage parents, to assign" fast decisions to hit and the child a ,nicht defined‘, she declared.
We fear that favors interventions.
We think it would be better the masculine or feminine sex to assign and to wait then.
However nor we do not know how the law will affect, therefore we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the recognition for adults possible as a third sex".
„Adults should be in the situation to make own decisions on their legal sex", it declared.
With the case of the German law it is a question of the assignment at the birth.
That is not a fight which one should force small children to this time to.
If they are grown-up, they themselves can decide on their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation trouble and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group says the German law „authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with masculine chromosomes, a DSD has, however, by the name of complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron Katie developed feminine characteristics.
It has a vagina, however no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie 29 is and marries; she works on the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.
Indeed it is infertile, hopes, however, for being able to get a child through adoption or a lending-mother.
„The law gives parents to room through which she does not rush decisions must hit", Baratz said.
It provides them with the time, to do different tests and to clear things and time gives so to them before they „manly" or „in a feminine way" write.
In this way everything is all right – one raises the child and loves it.
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parent luck.
And one does not have to carry out rashly an operation which cannot be canceled anymore.
„That closes the children into the decision with one and removes the fear that drives parents because they think they would not „do" the correct thing" explained it.
Finally the child decides on the sex that co-ordinates to it better – and that is wonderful.
Through that children are moved into the situation to make the decision itself.
Excellent the fight mastered
The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novelette "The old man and the sea", is cut to Horst Janson onto the body.
Janson is even an old hare in his profession, the dramatic art.
The old man Santiago cannot fool to any during the fishing.
So the two of them complement themselves simply splendidly.
One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the nape of the old man which the Fisherman-Young Manolo speaks of.
If Santiago in a tired way of the life fits bently on the chair, that is really at Janson.
Next to that the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the history of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally gains the fight through his knowledge and also his will strength against the fish.
Janson is in wide stretches as alone actors on the stage.
It manages to focus the attention of the public on himself so that his monologs are no moment boring.
His efforts, to grow the fish at last onto the surface of the water, are so really that the spectators forget that nevertheless the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann makes the old man in the boat before the fishing village act.
During the performance he puts the in each case active scene in the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, that with theirs songs' and their marvellous voice's the joy of living of Cuba records.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm for this purpose and are at the same time guests of the bars.
Fancy for ice cream which shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – with the aid of jellyfishes.
Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea animals zunutze and a radiant titbit created from that.
The idea on that came to him after he had read a study work about jellyfishes and could convince Chinese scientists to make the radiant protein artificially
The ice cream reacts with the case of the consumption with the tongue by which the pH-value is raised in the protein and the brightness activated.
Chris declares, the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and that shines – more each therefore one licks the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: „The product is incredible, however still in a very early production phase, and so one gets two grams of that for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with the case of a neutral pH-value.
If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines.
We tested it in the last months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it at Halloween because it has this wonderful shining-effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream which I ever manufactured, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold is.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for their unusual taste directions which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong to.
Nevertheless his newest creation is supposed to become even more ambitious.
He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream."
That is impossible at and for itself due to the refraction which is caused by the ice crystals which ice cream consists of; but I presume we find a possibility to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that is made by Chinese scientist artificially
Salem: Johanna Rahner during the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
During the next Ecumenical conversation forum on Monday, 21st October, in the New museum of the castle it is a question of the topic "To the hell with the hell - Theological considerations for the present contact with the last things".
Consultant is professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelic church municipalities Salem, the Salem castle's and the culture office's Lake Constance circle
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question today the people classify the "last things" after the death.
The people would have known about that too much in the last centuries and backed on those pictures in this case from sky and hell "that shape to today our ideas so is characterized the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes for completion rather through a certain embarrassment or quite Sprachlosigkeit.
"Christians were cured of the greater hope appropriately by the religion criticism says the consultant.
She "supplied us with so many question marks, that us the exclamation marks seem to have gotten lost.
Johanna Rahner passes on: "Nevertheless the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of the death".
The question about that longing "which dreams about at the end everything liking to be good" is combined with that.
Johanna Rahner, 1962 given birth in Baden-Baden, of 1982 to 1989 Catholic Theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs university Fribourg studied.
She promovierte in 1997 to the Dr. theol., also in Fribourg.
The Habilitation for basic theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms-University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner holds a chair for Systematic theology at the institute for Catholic theology of the Kassel university.
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding-questions
"The marriage state is the most important voyage of discovery which the human being can undertake", said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips as at least the wedding succeeds now a special fair gave in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro-look held again entry.
That begins for instance near the wedding dresses.
Must is white, best covered or in cream.
In front the dresses in many cases gathered and put embroideries are closed, often with a veil, behind on the other hand they go down to the backs and end often in a train.
There, however, the spirits part as Kleidermüller stresses to Stefanie Koch of the fashion house.
With gentlemen the suit with waistcoat and Plastron dominates, but also creamy or brown combinations can be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant is important, was declared.
Plain next rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be especially.
Here the domain made own offer attentive on it in the Remise.
Who wants to drive up then with the coach, for that one Uwe Link has an offer.
"Coaches are but also for young donkey linen departures likes", it thinks.
Romanticism is also for invitation cards, flower arrangements and asked also for wedding pictures.
More and more in vogue the "anus Wedding photo" comes - therefore photo series at special places, preferably about instance waterfalls, some days after the celebration, but into wedding clothing, declared Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a succeeded wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board cake and also a magician, as about instance Marko Ripperger, the guests' stylish can talk.
Not to forget the correct cosmetics and nail care
All for an unforgettable celebration.
Google, Samsung, Huawei because of Nortel patents sues
The group, the thousands of former Nortel patents has, an avalanche of complaints because of patent infringement against mobile manufacturers tired on Thursday, under that also Google, the enterprise that was outdone by Nortel during the insolvency auction from it
Rockstar, the consortium which had bought the Nortel-patents for 4.5 billion United States dollars sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other enterprises because of patent infringements in front of the US district court in Texas.
There is Rockstar in the community possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of the patent infringement.
The patents would affect technology that brings search keys words into correspondence in the Internet with relevant advertising so the complaint that Suchmaschinengeschäft hits the core of Googles with that.
Representative of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and skirt star were not immediately accessible
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobiles which work with Googles operating system Android which stands in sharp competition to the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In the year 2011 Google gave an initial commandment over 900 million dollars for the Nortel-patents.
Google increased his offer repeatedly and last offered 4.4 billion United States dollars.
After it was outdone by Rockstar near the Nortel-patents, Google Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion United States dollars, a business acquired, who from Motorolas library was also partially motivated at patents.
„Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patents during the auction, Google hurt the patents and does this also furthermore", so the complaint writing.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, there claimed it, of Googles patent infringement is deliberate, so the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees are supposed to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could become soon sensitively more expensive.
The municipal council of the city discusses this morning about a presentation of traffic departmental head Stefan Majer (Greens Party).
Accordingly the parking fees are supposed to be increased around 50 percent.
However not the prices are supposed to be begun an, but be shortened the time interval from parking meters and park appearance automats from 30 on 20 minutes.
In December the Stadtverordnetenversammlung must still decide.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt does not hold that "for any good idea".
The park possibility immediately in front of the business is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller authorized dealers".
The Germany traffic club thinks that a rise is "absolutely adequate and actually for a long time overdue" after two decades.
The public local traffic becomes also more expensive.
Oil price keeps on dropping apart from 96 USD per barrel
The oil price kept on falling also on Friday after worries about a high offer overshadowed a report according to which the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China increases.
The reference crude oil sort for deliveries in December had fallen at the late morning into Europe in the electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange about 14 cents on 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell around 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a collapse of prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The big crude oil offer loaded the prices in the last weeks.
The energy ministry of the USA declared on Wednesday the US offer increased last week barrel around 4.1 million.
In the course of five weeks barrel had climbed around 25 million the offer.
However, on Friday there were references to stronger demand through two reports about an activity increase in the Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a consecutive recovery of the economy of China that growth had gone up onto 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it quarter had arrived above on the lowest state in two decades.
Crude oil of the sort Brent, a reference value for international crude oil that is used also by US American refineries attacked the ICE Exchange in London about 26 cents on 108.58 USD per barrel.
The throw away society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere well, but sometime it is slow house.
Only: In the stomachs of the people on the co-driver and moving seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Clear, for that one or the other cocktail or champagne likes to be responsible!
What seems likely there, than to go to the next Drive-In gechillt in order to treat oneself on a small thing?
I add, I am gladly with in this case, if it late at night and/or in the early morning goes onto the Fastfood-getting.
A few chips, a coke, a Burger - and then nix as off home and into the bed!
However, on the way home the obvious differences become noticeable between me and other hungrigen Disco-Gängern.
Because what one must lack, that one flings his Fastfood bags from the car window with constant regularity?!
Paper bags thrown away are due particularly to the weekends at street edges and on parking places.
"Why?" I ask to myself.
The people are too dumb, around the bags with home respektive to take up to the next garbage can?
It is not only like this, that the paper stuff's the landscape verschandelt.
Bags already concealed traffic facilities as guardrails and activated accidents through that.
Said "throw away society" does not think about something like that, however, presumably she not even knows what means this word actually.
If one is in the evening more often on the way, first rakes with several people in the car, knows one, as a moving-bank after celebrated nights can look: Rags, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
Nevertheless there a few bags would form more or less also nix - unlike the street, where no one wants to stamp on the food residues of others.
I see really already the day coming, at which the removing becomes too stupid to the cities and to municipalities - and have to demand the Fastfood chains for their bags pledge.
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane Ernährung requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Mashed Tofu with plant cream is for example a curd substitute.
The vegetarian Federal Government to the Weltvegantag names further ones on 1st November.
The Germany vegetarian Federal Government suggests a series of veganen alternatives on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on 1st November:
A good alternative to butter is pure plant margarine, Joghurt makes replace by soya yogurt.
Instead of milk can Soya-, be used oat, almond or rice milk.
Impact Cash Plant Cream replaces traditional whipped cream.
Also to eggs there are vegetable alternatives.
Half a crushed, ripe banana for example can replace an egg as binding agent in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple purée or a tablespoon of milled linseeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for that.
Doughs become loose instead of with egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or Seidentofu can serve this purpose.
According to information of the Vebu about 800 000 people eat currently in Germany vegan, therefore in that vegetable.
A black box in the car?
US American street planners are in search of a money source in order to repair the deteriorating highway-system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the instrumentation panel of every car.
The devices which record every driven kilometer and which information onto the authorities announce are central point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal states to rework the obsolete system for the financing of US American streets.
The usually rather boring field of the road planning provoked suddenly an intense debate with colored alliances.
Libertäre allied with environmental groups and speak out for that, that the government use the small boxes for the write-out of the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – and be able to use the information then for the calculation of notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American civil rights union (ACLU) is also most deeply worried and expresses a series of data protection objections.
However, while one is not can agree on a procedure in the congress, several Federal states do not wait longer.
You check currently how they can change in the course of the next ten years for a system with the driver per driven mile pay.
Thousands of motorists already tested the tachographs from which some are endowed with GPS-supervision.
That is really a must for our country.
„It is not anything, that we will use only possibly", Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern California Assn, said. of Governments who plans a recording of the driven miles with all Californian motorists in the Federal state from 2025.
The kind and manner as we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes to a time since the highway trust is broke to Fund which is financed from the taxes which US Americans give at the petrol pump.
However, in America as much is not refueled more as formerly.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been increasing for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare with the case of high spirit prices also to lift the steering wheels only around a cent.
„The gasoline tax is simply not future-capable", according to Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.
His Federal state furnished 500 cars with tachographs with which a mile-based paying-system is supposed to be tested recent.
„That represents the on a long-term basis most reasonable alternative" he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee
It does not surprise that urban liberals approve the idea, because the tax could be used for example dazu to influence the driving behavior so that jams and climate-harmful waste gases are reduced.
The Californian planners put on the system during the preparation from strategies with which the ambitious, by law anchored objectives of the Federal state for the climate change are supposed to be reached.
Nevertheless the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, also declared that he sees the most feasible long-term alternative in that.
Also the free ones Vermarkter of the Reason Foundation are caused from the idea to make drivers to covered stretch be paid.
„That is not a tax which disappears in a black hole", declares Moore, vice-president, Adrian for guidelines at Reason.
Paying the people directly for what they get.
The movement is supported also by two former American Ministers of Transport that had asked in a report in the year 2011 the congress to move in direction of mile-based billing.
The US senate approved last year a pilot project 90 million dollars expensive which would have contained 10,000 cars.
Nevertheless the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and reacted in this way to the objections of representatives from rural fields which people represent who must often cover many miles in the everyday life on the way to the work or into the city.
Several Federal states and cities move nonetheless on own initiative in this direction.
Oregon, which recruits currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment of the country, is at the most engaged.
These drivers will pay soon the mile fees to the Federal state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada finished already a pilot project.
New York City considers also one like that.
Illinois tests it in restricted measure with trucks.
And the I-95-Koalition which the traffic ministries belong to from 17 Federal states at the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines currently as one could introduce the change.
The draft is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were sceptical with the case of the thought the government could pursue each of their movements.
„Objections against Big Brother and such things were a great problem", declares Alauddin Khan, conductor of the strategy and result management, in the traffic ministry of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their web site: It would be relatively simple to change the tachographs into full-grown invigilators."
No necessity to establish a gigantic, unwieldy technological infrastructure which would be used unavoidably to entering data about the daily movements of individuals exists.
Nevada does not belong to a row exactly from Federal states that stay now according to affordable technology look-out with which the state can capture the driven kilometers, however, when and where.
In this way, so khan, also the public would be more calmed.
The hunt according to this technology led some authorities to a small startup-enterprise by the name of True Mileage in californiums.
The company did not line up initially in order to help Federal states from motorists during the taxation.
Rather it was their aim of gripping in a rising market for Kfz insurances feet in the case of which drivers are supposed to pay on basis of the driven miles.
Nevertheless the devices tested by her are interesting also for the street planners because they do not work with GPS and only restricted information that are loaded regularly by modem deliver.
„The people are rather ready to participate in that if their speed and locations are not recorded", declared Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs great errors were made.
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to transplant this.
In Oregon the planners experiment with giving motorists a series of choices.
You keep yourself up for a device or without GPS decide.
Or they do not choose at all any device and pay one instead of this flat rate on basis of the miles on the average driven by all inhabitants of the Federal state.
Other places hope for being able to sell the draft to a mistrustful public when they endow the devices with more functions when with wenigeren.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device into the taxation with which make pay also parking fees, an insurance must be paid only for driven kilometers and speed data are raised by other vehicles in real time thanks to which motorists can evade jams.
„Motorists would be motivated to the participation by the added value of the advantages which the system offers", it is said in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners wonder however, whether the whole gossip is not only a gigantic diversion about the paying per mile.
With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the field of the San Francisco Bay officials declared, the congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust find simple through rise of the fuel tax.
An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles which consume little gasoline so that also these pay a fair part.
„There is not any reason for an operation if an aspirin also suffices", explains Randy Rentschler, the conductor for legislation and public matters of the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do themselves worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Bath thin home: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the importance for the city and the soccer club the official opening celebration did not pay for anything for the artificial turf sports ground in spite of the cold weather and the rain one.
Presumably all had wanted a more pleasant ceremony on the last Saturday, however, Petrus did not want to play in this case.
So all those had the checking, that came without umbrella or could not hold one like that for any reason.
That went the musicians that framed the ceremonial act just the same as some speaker.
Also the FC chairperson Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream became wet therefore.
His thanks were meant first and foremost for mayor Walter Klumpp that committed himself to the conversion of the project strongly, the district council, the shared enterprises and association members that brought in.
Here completely especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rüstigen pensioners laid out 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
Also the landtag State Parliament representative Karl Rombach acknowledged this remarkable honorary engagement.
Further greeting words spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairperson of the south Baden soccer association Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought into memory, that always again weather influences turning round in the spring and fall added the initial field so, that it could not be played on.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to the solution of the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of near the ground of the soccer club or near the secondary school at the saltworks lake.
Both was rejected again.
Six years ago thoughts for the application of an artificial turf sports ground arose, which was regarded as the ultimative solution generally.
Concrete plannings were incorporated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube into heritage lease, a cost participation of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place accepted and the country promotion means of 104 000 euros approved.
The district council concluded in October 2012 the takeover of the remaining 356 000 euros at the total costs of 560 000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The start of building of the 68 times 108 meters of big artificial turf place occurred on 4th June.
During the more than three months continuous construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were leveled from which half was used for the application of a Dirt-Bike-stretch
Strangers hurt girls through shot from car
Strangers hurt with the case of shots from a car a twelve year long one in Saxony-Anhalt.
The culprits had presumably lit with an air pressure arm at the Thursday evening in Genthin onto a group from children.
That informed of the police in Burg.
The girl was hurt easily at the left calf.
Rescue teams brought the girl into the hospital.
The shot came from a small car which had driven past a group of six children and suddenly had stopped.
Witnesses saw two people being in the car.
The culprits in addition fired onto a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Afterwards they went from that.
The criminal investigation department investigates, it was said on Friday.
Snowden ready, „co-operate" with Germany too with respect to US supervision
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US American secret service, declared it is ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag Federal Parliament if the American National Security Agency and their director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German representative Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this received asylum in order to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden which was presented to the media by Ströbele on Friday in Berlin this writes: „Even if the result of my efforts was nachweislich positive, my government keeps on handling a differing opinion as a faith break and attempts to kriminalisieren political opinion comment with punishment threat with the case of which no defense is possible."
To say the truth is not, however, a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes it is convinced from that of the support of the international community being able to convince the American government of making the accusation against it fall.
The accusation raised by the US Ministry of Justice covers espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said Online opposite time: „If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we find then ways to facilitate that."
The relationships between the USA and Germany are loaded by the claims the NSA listened to the mobile from chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the representative who guides the parliamentary committee, responsible for the secret service, declared one is supposed to seize the occasion to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible „without endangering it and completely ruining the relationships to the USA".
Ströbele, a representative of the greens Party, a picture of themselves and Snowden in his Twitter-Feed published.
He was helped with his visit by two German journalists in Russia.
Declared to Ströbele, that according to the attorney of the former NSA employee Snowden not to Russia can return, if he leaves the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assertion then, that it is there „secure according to the representative.
Snowden declares in his letter that he would see himself exposed to a „serious and continuous" pursuit campaign that marketed it from his home.
It is, however, affected from the worldwide reaction to „my act of the political opinion comment".
Citizens on the whole world as well as hochrangige politicians – also in the United States – referred to the disclosures as a merit about supervision covering an uncontrolled system at the general public
In his letter Snowden makes an offer of the cooperation for the German authorities „if the difficulties were solved around the humanitarian situation".
Security objections in Mozambique increase faced with collisions between influential personalities
Thousands of people met in the center of Maputo among the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first presidents of Mozambique in order to start at a rare public demonstration peace calls.
„We want again peace, we want stability", Vanessa de Sousa, manageress of an investment enterprise, said.
For fear around the future of the country she exchanged their business clothing against a T-shirt with the label „We demand security in Portuguese and connected on Thursday of the amount on the independence place of the capital.
For two weeks there are almost daily reports about collisions between government strengths and Renamo which number among the worst combats since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was at one time a notorious rebel movement, that initially of the Rhodesia ruled over from white and later the Apartheitsregierung Südafrikas was supplementary in the bothering, to destabilize the independent government of the country.
According to the peace treaty of 1992 she became an opposition party.
Analysts hold it for improbable that the country lapses again into a full-grown conflict, nevertheless the recent events worried foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy a lot stands on the game, because the discovery of gigantic gas occurrences in front of the coast and coal stockyard in the north-west could bring into the country in the next years of investments of more than 50 billion United States dollars of companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo blame mutually for the tensions.
Renamo says the government provoked the recent collisions when it would have attacked their members on 17th October in the province Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.
To kill the infringements of the former rebels escalated Afonso Dhlakama, attacked as government troops Renamo footholds and attempted, the chief of the group, declared Renamos speakers opposite the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collisions and the organization accuses, to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza attempted to ran through objections about an instability.
Opposite AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself as „a loser that wants to use „all his still residual strengths in order to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.
Nevertheless the objections increased since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo gives the peace agreement from 1992.
Opposite the FT it declared it thought in this way that Frelimo does not respect the agreement anymore.
„Our vision is it, to resume negotiations and serious indeed", Mazanga said.
Former conversations between the parties contributed only little to the settlement of the tensions that was inspired by a series of collisions this year.
„We have here two grown-up men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that the heads collide", thinks Joseph Hanlon, university lecturer, at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.
No one of them is good in the negotiating and it is not ready to any to do the necessary concessions.
Renamo who insists on choice reforms declared already she will boycott the local choices in November.
Premiership and parliament choices are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of power as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial sales allowances of the government.
Renamos choice successes shrink since 1992 while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique founded by a former Renamo-member (MDM), will presumably be improving at the choices
Mazanga says that Guebuza – whose resignation waits if his second term of office ends in the next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
„He" wants no increase party democracy, „he does not want any transparent choices he does not want any peace because he does not „want" to give up the presidency" so Mazanga.
It is unclear which capacities Renamo has, however, she has on attacks bringing about noise on police stations and vehicles one important north south connections done.
Most combats occurred in the province Sofala, the some a Hundred Kilometers north of Maputo lies, in which there is Beira, however, the harbor use the mining industry skilled one as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June Rio suspended for a month the use of the railroad after Renamo had announced an attack on the stretch
Mazanga answered cautiously the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted „the international community warn against the things" not „standing in Mozambique well Mazanga said.
The instability still increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, conductor of Mediacoop, to an independent media enterprise, because many people worried already because of the corruption, the slow progress at the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
„The people think" that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he should be that one who finds solutions for the problems", it declares.
Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said the people simply wanted only stability.
„Renamo and Frelimo do not interest any, they simply want peace and usable streets only again", he declared.

NSA declares, an „internal error and not hacker are fault at the crash of the web site
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on the late Friday, an error crippled their public web site some hours and not hacker, as in an online way was claimed.
„NSA.gov was not tonight accessible for some hours since during a planned update an internal error occurred", explained the espionage agency in an announcement sent by E-Mail.
The problem is solved at this evening.
The claim the loss is distributed by one Denial of service attack carried out (DDoS) caused, is not true.
In the early evenings it was liked online-server tracing-core that the NSA web site was not accessible for at least six hours and is not this also furthermore for some users.
Before a speaker of the NSA had declared opposite ABC news the sensitive internal network of the authority is not compromised „in any manner".
Secret information are not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least a group of Hacktivisten used for itself, to have crippled the NSA web site with a DDoS attack.
In the case of such attacks the target web site with side calls is flooded to which servers are overloaded and the web site collapses.
The Cybertaktik is relatively simple and the attacks are not used for interrupting the internal network of the destination system.
The formerly supersecret NSA, whose nickname once No Such Agency (None such an authority) said, finds itself meanwhile in the bright light of the public and sees itself after the disclosures become known in the last months about their extensive monitoring program program exposed to sharp criticism nationally and internationally – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden and published.
The wachsende controversy around the secret service inspired initial speculations about that, which is incident today the result of a purposeful Cyperoperation.
Snowden could testify also in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could do statements in the US peering-affair also in his Russian asylum
Representatives of the federal general prosecution could ask either questions in writing or meet the 30-year long one also personally in Russia.
The agency inter fax announced that under appointment on nearer not designated circles which are familiar to the situation.
Such a question can be clarified in an interstate way, it was said.
A departure Snowdens from Russia is practically impossible.
"In this case he loses his refugee status", the agency quoted their sources
Because Germany is ally of the USA, the delivery over threatens Snowden there, it kept on being said
Children should get myths and legends as „Models for the living" supplied, thinks an author.
The histories of Thor showed that „brutal strength does not have any chance against clever tricks", and the Artus-legend demonstrates how it is importantly to have a dream.
Many of the myths are switched on, however, „by far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty, to be taught to schools", for which Crossley-Holland pleaded for a „careful selection" of age-just works „around.
„I think it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of the education he said.
I have been suggesting that as a plan already for twenty years.
He added with „authors and" „teachers" who are „didactic excessively children would completely switch off, because in entertaining histories the messages would be provided „subliminally".
Crossley-Holland that translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and declared, author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk valley is: „One can pursue certain intentions but one should hold it as in the background as possible."
The maybe greatest difference between a grown-up author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children lies in the necessity to provide hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy ending, however, there is an immanent sense for good and evils.
This by which history is revealed and does not declare must be subliminal represented.
That is the old history of the showing instead of telling.

Haslach: Skepticism moves confidence rapidly
With the choices to the parish council 2015 basic one will change itself for example in the spiritual charge unit of Haslach (SE).
There is then only still a common parish council for all six parishes.
In a common meeting the committees prepared themselves for the changes on Saturday from Haslach, Hofstetten, mill creek fisherman creek Steinach and Welschensteinach.
Because nothing more is to be changed at the fundamental decisions of the diocese and moving these as satisfactorily as possible is at the parish councils.
In the course of the day became especially clear: the skepticism about the new one gives way hesitatingly but rapidly to a confidence.
Of the ideas and expectations onto the innovations 2015 up to concrete proposals about the future composition and the size of the parish council sufficed the extremely constructive conversations of the six committees with the full-time ones of the spiritual charge team.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained by means of a presentation the again understood guidelines for spiritual charge units in the archdiocese Fribourg.
After that the SE Haslach forms as a church municipality in the future a corporation of the public right which kicks in into the rights and duties of the up to now six single church municipalities
There will be only another common parish council and a foundation council in which the priest is to strength Amtes to represent.
From every parish at least two elected members are supposed to be represented, in the six parishes on site so-called municipality teams are formed.
Your task of supporting the ecclesiastical life in the place will be it future.
With the case of the question about the finances of the single parish considerable conversation need was proved then.
The innovations plan that collected credits are maintained in the parishes committedly.
On the other hand the obligations pass onto the total municipality
Just with regard to the great planned investments whose obligation then all parishes find there were great objections.
"Also in the past became invested only into projects that could be overcome from the single parishes alone" parish council chairperson Bruno Prinzbach relocated Haslachs.

You had turned yourself into the task in 2006, "Become one, five stay" and had to state that that is not so simple at all.
The committees of the Haslacher spiritual charge unit got down then to answering the questions to the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the municipality teams.
The preparations are concretized in further meetings and concluded in a further common meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.
At the end parish council Michael Schöner presented from Steinach the new logo of the spiritual charge unit which was agreed to with clear majority.
Steering wheel for foreign immovable owners against London's speculation bubble
The Exchequer calculated the CGT measure provisional still waits, however, for the definitive decision of treasure chancellor George Osborne that had imposed a stamp tax in the budget in 2012 at the level of 7 % on apartments the more than two million pounds cost as well as annual fees for buyers that consider apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now the gains from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts Westminster exceed and Humber gathered up Kensington & Chelsea that were near 708 million pounds in the tax year 2012/13 the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, north-west, Yorkshire and the region
Cook said: „After the rises with the case of the stamp tax onto hochpreisige apartments and the introduction of the legislation combined with that against a handling one can scarcely say high-quality immovables are too low taxed despite the effects of the obsolete local tax system."
„Nevertheless this step could make some foreign investors more reserved, what concerns to the purchase of immovables in London, or properties keep from selling," he added.
First-class immovables – the uppermost five to ten percent of the housing market according to price – in the prosperous London southwest belt which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon increased themselves in price around the record value of 11.8 % in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed a regular annual growth from 5.6 %, were overshadowed, however, by a rising „home market" on which the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4 %) and the east (6.5 %) experienced an upward trend, such investigation of Savills.
There keeps on being good atmosphere, even if the SG is Achim/Baden for four game days without victory, with the Handball-Oberligisten.
At that coach Tomasz Malmon does not let at all any doubts.
They are all fully kept on being motivated with the case of the thing.
Nevertheless I hope for our winning also once again at last
"Because I white yes no more already at all as such a victory tastes" Malmon expects a success experience of his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve has currently not pulled out yet any trees of Fredenbeck, Malmon previously lifts the forefinger warningly.
I myself trained many players still in the A-youth.
Of therefore they motivate against their ex-coach surely completely especially.
"Furthermore it is to wait necessary, whether strengthening from the First in this case is still", the SG coach clarifies.
In order to return to the success track at last again, the Malmon-team must increase itself in any case in comparison with the last appearances.
Nevertheless before all things in the cover work and during the switching game it last haperte tremendously.
Also the chance utilization must become definitively better.
Therefore I hope for my players getting the head freely during the short pause at last
USA keep on wanting to pursue Snowden legally
The USA did not change their attitude to the former US secret service employee Edward Snowden.
He keeps on being reproached to have passed on without authorization secret information.
Therefore he must be confronted in the USA with a punishment procedure, said the speaker of the US foreign ministry of State, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.

Before the German greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to keep on threatening it with punishment
Psaki stressed, that it is a question of those of a parliamentarian with the case of Ströbeles comments and not around those of a German government member.
Report: Obama-campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The narrowest consultants of president Barack Obama considered in secret to replace vice-president Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton in the election campaign 2012 so the New York Times.
The disclosure is the most noteworthy surprise of the long expected work of marks of Halperin and John Heilemann about the election campaign 2012, „Down voice-dubs: Game Change 2012".
There is a copy of the soon appearing Buchs for the Times and she told at the Thursday evening that the top consultants of the president „extensive group meetings and inquiries at the end of 2011 would have carried out in order to find out whether it looks for hope fading away to Obamas for re-election better if he makes Biden fall.
Say Jonathan Martin, national-political correspondent of the Times, paints in the book of employees of the campaign and the White House leading the history of the efforts thoroughly, in particular the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, measure, which effect it has exchanged onto the inquiry values the former exterior minister Clinton against the vice-president.
The potential change was a severely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office
Only half a dozen of the narrowest consultants of the president – including Daley, the former campaign conductor of Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading consultants of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thought change answer.
Is asserted in „Double Down", Daley stood at the top of the efforts to exchange Biden in spite of their „narrow, personal relation before one decided finally against such a move after the data showed the chances Obamas not to improve the candidacy of Clintons in a leading way would become.
In an interview with Martin it confirmed Daley in replacing Biden by Clinton that in fact the government considered.
„I expressed a whole series of things that one should take into consideration, and that was one „of them", Daley declared to the magazine.
One must call oneself into memory, that the president had then dreadful inquiry values, therefore we thought: „For God's sake, what we do"?
While Daley was referring to the investigations as „offered care", it said to Martin opposite Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expenditure was invested in order to find out whether such a train is worthwhile with regard to the ballot boxes.
„In campaigns as much money is not spent for inquiries and focus groups if one does not think about something seriously", declared Martin on AC360.
It is not, however, clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange
Martin said opposite CNN he asked Daley whether his former boss about the potential change would have known answer.
Although Daley declared he does not believe that the president of the possible change was conscious to himself, the former chief of staff admitted it was „possible" that Obama knew about that.
Martin added, that „Down voice-dubs" no definitive answer to the question whether the political sounding outs Obamas would have reached Schreibtisch delivers.
Co-opera asked Martin whether he thinks seriously Obama did not know about the investigations anything over whether one is supposed to make fall to Biden at the choices
„Possibly", Martin replied.
District council is pleased with sound budget
Whenever it is a question of the budget in district council meetings mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration does not know debts anymore already since 2005.
Also the financial year 2012 can be credited as full success in this sense.
This became clear during the idea of the annual accounts for 2012.
How Andrea Rothmund explained is the administration budget with about 7.6 million euros more than one millions of euros more highly unusual than planned.
Also the surplus of the administration house hold lies with about 1.8 million euros about one millions of euros above the approach.
The surplus is to be owed to particularly higher trade tax gains and the municipality part of the income tax.
Also the property budget lay again clearly about the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros it was in the last year 2.5 million euros.
"This is due basically to the higher supply from the administration budget", according to Rothmund.
Since in the financial year 2012 less investments were made than plannedly, also the reserve supply turned out more highly.
In total the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros on now in total 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good work
"One does simply not joggle such work from the sleeve", Gerster with look onto the annual accounts praised.
It and the district councils were pleased with the good numbers visibly.
It likes to ring paradoxical, nevertheless exactly these good numbers can the citizens soon to stand expensively come.
Through the good financial condition the municipality could renounce in the past high tax factors.
Through that in turn subsidies were already often shortened, however, by the country according to Gerster.
For these subsidies from various compensation sticks there are conditions.
Among other things the cities and municipalities which apply for subsidies must show certain tax factors.
"We must have a look at the topic tax factors since in the coming years investments wait for which we would have subsidies gladly" announced Gerster in this connection

Despair scream of an Obama-voter
I elected president Obama twice in the hope for change being possible
He says Obama undertook praiseworthy efforts which were foiled from the blockade tactics of the republicans
The blockade politics does not excuse for the web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obamas memoirs about the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at that one Harvard Medical School.
I read currently a dreadfully sad book.
It is a book from which I believed, it would cheer me up during the sad second year of my medicine study and there would be again hope to me.
„The Audacity to Win" (Courage to win) is called and describes the memoirs of Barack Obamas for the premiership choice 2008.
If I am ready in the evening with my patient records and go to bed, the book takes me back then to a time, as the politics millions inspired and a talking the breath could rob.
The choice became a landslide victory and newsreaders paused in order to make the historical importance of this hour clear.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all newspapers which they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way into the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When changed then 2008 Obama into the office, he had approval values of 82 %.
And then I close the book.
Again a bad awakening is to be switched over to the present as if one is torn from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder onto missed possibilities.
In the years since I gave my voice for the first time something changed in fact.
But it is simply not anything what I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the splendid and many-sided things that Obama reached from the discharge of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance up to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama of bin Ladens.
Also I think that the party-political blockade tactics tilted too many attempts with which our nation should be brought forward: To name immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, only around some.
However after I have defended countless times the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintances, I arrived with my declaration attempts at the end
I reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade politics cannot declare, for which one approves the sound monitoring of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children through drones overseas.
It cannot be declared why the National Security Agency gathers data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower who disclose state error behavior are punished.
It cannot declare, for which Anwar al-Awlaki, a US American citizen, without procedures was murdered, still why the public financing and edition borders are avoided during the premiership choices
It does not justify the results of a report in which it means the efforts of the White House to the quiet position of the media are the most „aggressive... since the Nixon government".
And recently it cannot excuse for the impotence, to project a simple web site in the more than three years since the discharge of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding to her.
Obviously the representative office is not a foreseeable course since an opposition party and accidental events as the Newtown-massacre shape the public discussion.
However if I have a look at the above-mentioned examples, then they seem elected by the government itself to a large extent his
And that disturbs me the most.
I chose in 2012 Obama again, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and immature alternative, it seemed not to be able to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices would fulfill the hope which we had heard about already for so long.
However with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45 % this week the return became the harder in the year 2008 through this book.
It wakes in me the longing for the many promises which dissolved in Luft.
This week I read a section in the book, that one describes as Obama had to take a difficult loss against Clinton with the case of the preselections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election officers according to the decision he said to his employees they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their thing.
„I would like, that we regain our charm he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree to you more strongly.
The opinions expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
