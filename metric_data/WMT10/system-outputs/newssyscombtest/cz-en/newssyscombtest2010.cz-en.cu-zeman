The us: a repeat of the mother is wisdom
Is the komické, with what školáckou snaživostí barack obama, president with a reputation as a nejchytřejšího, repeated in afghanistan the strategy of his predecessor, which saw himself as the nejhloupějšího.
When longingly at long last vypotil its expected afghan doctrine,, that it turned out to opsal across the kopírák of bush 's iraq scenarios before the three years ago.
Not only in the text several used slovního turning "even as" in iraq, but did not hesitate to use the name of bush 's statement from january 2007, as the name of its own declaration: "a new way forward."
On the himself three years ago criticized bush 's idea send fresh the surge in iraq - ridden civil war as a "irresponsible, and in the aftermath of catastrophic" decisions.
The subsequent months, however, showed that bush 's strategy that emanates from the recommendations field commanders was the only possible and veleúspěšnou, so much so that is now in the intelligence relacích talking about iraq at all.
Bush to reputation nevylepšilo left his successor, but objectively much vděčnější starting situation, than it can be expected.
In afghanistan hopes barack obama in to repeating that miracle.
The increase in military force will once again asked him dirt commanders, especially the commander - in - chief of the afghan operations, general stanley mccristal, which even despite subordinačním habits drsně zkritizoval tentative střelce in the white house.
40 of thousands of men, to stem the situation demands for the better.
Three months' s president váhal nothing better, but on nepřipadl, and so at least ošidil general of the 10 thousand soldiers.
Able to vyždímat the promise of other 5 of thousands of from europe, and when he was originally envisaged at least 10.
Nejproblematičtějším on the whole of obama 's strategy appears to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from afghanistan for 18 months, and to put an end to this process in the three years. for the obama doctrine raises more questions, than provides the answer.
Many doubt that polovičaté increase in the same fruit as progress in iraq.
Despite internecine war of the last years of iraqi society is relatively well - uspořádaná, its leaders of the integrity of the agreement.
Afghanistan 's situation is characterized by the opposite sign - rely on, no one can be no agreement, and do not observe.
Badly, under these conditions on afghan security forces of accustomed to what change master according to this day, as it suits them.
Political institutions, and when they formally based, will remain a potemkin village, for which will continue to spread patriarchální tribal relations.
Rebalancing the interests of ethnic groups, which is extremely difficult, given the nepřehlednosti conditions more complicate pakistan and iran 's influences.
Or a "akceschopného the goal of the state," which is' s minimal operations, does not look as too real.
The time horizon of obama 's strategy astounded their voluntarismem.
For the past eight years, the situation in afghanistan only deteriorate and is now on the brink of the explosion.
To believe in this, that vojáčci posílaní into war turmoil in order to "of an early return home" will cause here učiněný miracle, can only the soul of a truly romantic, the reality of nedotknutá.
From a political point of view, it is determining the data withdrawal troops as it nezodpovědností, because the taliban to be seen as a indirect recognition of america 's defeat.
The latest nato summit, showed that the europeans' willingness to participate in the coming to mínusu combat operations in afghanistan.
Europe 's politicians cannot explain their own voters, and don' t want to be the way the security of germany, or italy has to do with the war in podhůří hindu.
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in iran 's situation is events around.
Worse, if the situation will continue to a enhanced sanctions on the iranians don 't do emerge from the united states přetěžká the question of whether is not solve the problem of military force.
The answer to it will be something to be in a time when, according to the obama 's přikročí america to vítěznému withdrawal from afghanistan.
But any such a solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in afghanistan 's situation.
The only náplastí for barack obama is the fact that, in presidential elections have three years, and thus remains to be enough time to come up with another strategy, if this proves full - scale propadák.

The discovery czech: a substance, which works, and 'otužilé' viruses hiv
A team of czech and german scientists new compounds, which can slow the spread of hiv testing in an organism.
The main advantage improved drugs is to that works, and viruses, which has received against drug immunity.
This fact will prevail over the in some cases, that sloučenina ordinary variants of the virus to operate as strongly as some have already available drugs.
Aids has cannot be cured.
Patients, however, can significantly prolong life a mixture of drugs, which preventing multiply hiv in the body.
But their use accompanied by many side effects.
Moreover, partial suppression of multiply the virus has resulted in the development of the so - called. resistentních viruses, against which are already drugs ineffective.
Labor experts from three institutions of the academy of sciences čr, všcht prague and of the university in the heidelbergu opens the way, how to deal with rezistencí the virus.
Have shown that drugs, known metalokarborany operating on bílkovinu responsible for multiply of hiv.
Metalokarborany compounds are boru, carbon hydrogen, and kobaltu.
These compounds block the spread of the virus otherwise than all the now used drugs, and because they can overcome the problem of resistance.
Scientists in their work, with new ‘ vylepšenými 's sloučeninami připravenými on the basis of knowledge molecular mechanism of their ties to viral bílkovinu.
Metalokarborany has a unique a three - dimensional structure of the two mnohostěnné: the cage of atoms boru, hydrogen, and carbon are connected atomem metal, in this case, kobaltem.
Zrádný and resistant virus
Hiv proteáza is protein hiv, which is necessary for the cycle of the virus.
Without hiv proteázou fission hiv caused by not ripe infectious viral particles.
When to stop hiv proteázu, to stop, and the spread of the virus in the pacientově body, explain scientists in the press the report 's institute organic chemistry, and biochemistry academy of sciences čr.
In the work published in science journal journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which the two couples cages (see chart) are connected short an organic chain of, which is also systematically pozměňován.
A weaker, but reliable
The effect of this series of substances against hiv proteáze was testován in her, and also against its sturdy (rezistentním) variants obtained from hiv - infected patients.
The effect of metalokarboranů on ordinary enzyme option is not as strong as u clinically užívaných drugs, but its effect neztrácí outcomes against whom they are resistant to use drugs often ineffective.
A unique mechanism effect, and also their biological is another characteristics as a chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of other chemical adjustment and from the metalokarboranů makes interesting compounds for other research towards the draft effective drugs against hiv, says pavlína řezáčová laboratories, leaders structural biology constitution organic chemistry, and biochemistry and the constitution of molecular genetics academy of sciences.
Hádka because of the budget. ods embarked on a fischer, ten to prevent
The head of the ods mirek topolanek called enacted for the next year 's budget for "horrible" and prime minister john fischer' s government should consider other the existence of a according to him.
The expression of ods called prime minister for strong statements.
So the time for analysis.
Deputy ods peter nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet, with the support of cssd, ods and the greens, clearly works.
Prime minister, according to nečase must decide whether to intends to base in the house of commons on a minority, which it is a struggle with rising deficits, or is it of staying in office with the help of the left 's parliamentary.
Ods and social democracy 's approach to the issues of public deficits is vastly different, has pointed out nečas.
House of adopted in the center of the budget on a year 2010, but with leftist pozměňovacími proposals for more than $12 billion korun.
House of increase in the money to pay civil servants, on the operation of social services, and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism governments to address the social democracy 's proposals was to, that hidden increase the budget deficit.
Čr 163 billion korun should run a deficit.
Ods before the vote went from the hall, meet the wishes of government, that i pozměněný the budget is less bad variant than the budget provizorium.
Disappointment a futile
Finance minister eduard janota talking about the disappointment and frustration, said that the government 's prime minister john fischer even assess the current situation.
Nečas, it is convinced that if by janota seriously threatened departure from functions in the case of acceptance of amendments, could look like the situation otherwise.
According to the czech tv, janota commissioned on monday after the government to prime minister.
The suggested that is considering other remaining in office.
The reason is his disappointment of budget negotiations.
If the fischer speaking for other have to fight the budget deficit, nečase what to do nominanti cssd in the government, which changes in the budget.
Prime minister, it should also clearly say that he would reach demisi, if the house of approve another laws deficit, increasing, for example, those concerned with the sick, pensions, or novelu služebního of law.
Topolanek: nominovaní ods ministers have neprovinili
This is the cause of prime minister fischer 's and the government.
Ministers nominovaní ods did nothing wrong, emphasized topolanek in the text report from the us.
Reminded that in a few ministries are náměstkovských positions hlásící to the top 2009 is that people voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if the fischer chooses to abandon the principle of struggle with levels of public - finance deficit, "is the logical and correct, that opře on the left - wing majority, which is now in the house of commons."
Then, but it cannot count on support, and tolerance of civic democrats.
Nepřemýšlel, i, and to the actual, so will be to pursue, i said, journalists in the house of secretary of defense martin barták, who do governments nominated the civic democrats.
Prime minister fischer afternoon flew to the european council in brussels.
At the request of the prime minister ods gave way to
Nečas also stressed that ods by in the center of the budget in the house of commons probably voted against pozměněnému, if by prime minister of the civic democrats explicitly did for this, to the adoption of the budget allowed.
Nepřipadáme as orphans, we are not small children, was then to respond to the question of whether to ods in political negotiations, the budget netížila the absence of the party in parliament and the czech republic.
I have, noticed that by my the voice of the missing.
No longer when i vzdával mandate, so i knew that in the next few months will be above all, bolševizaci house, and the destruction of all positive, responded topolanek himself.

Vaccine against pneumokokům will be free and optional
Vaccine against pneumokokům from january zboří zažité practices.
The first is to be the family 's for free, and also optional.
But no longer comes from the votes, that it would be a compulsory more effective vaccine.
Preparations for the introduction of a free a vaccine against pneumokokům vrcholí.
Lékový institution has already sets the maximum prices vaccines, which pays health insurance companies.
Experts also have no longer clear in the in a vaccine.
New vaccine
Vaccines for free for august children
Since january can be free očkovány against pneumokokům children, which was born last august 2. and later.
The condition is that even have not even one of the vaccine.
Who began to vaccinate or before last year, they must pay for himself, and other přeočkování.
The first dose of vaccinations must be podaná between 3. a. 5 month of a child 's age.
Last year immunization against pneumokokům a quarter of families voluntarily to their children.
Parents are paid more than 1,600 korun for one dose of even more.
In the youngest vaccine children are the need for four benefits.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance companies, on the vaccine benefits 300 to spend 450 of thousands of korun per year.
But on the treatment, which will save money needed by children without a vaccine.
So far, the state of all blanket vaccine has made the roughly $500 of thousands of children per year.
- funded vaccine was launched the so - called janotovým package.
Pneumokok causing respiratory middle ear, but also serious infection, including the zánětů brain blan and poisoning of blood.
Of pneumokokové infection in the us for a year according to surveys in hospitals and 28 children die in 10 years.
In addition to česka introduced - funded blanket immunizations of children against pneumokokům cca in 40 countries.
Will a vaccine mandatory?
At the same time, but there 's views, that, in the future could be compulsory vaccine.
Since january - funded is to be a optional.
That it would be a compulsory vaccine better, suggested, for example, the head of civic associations up rudolf kalovský.
His associations pneumokokové vaccines peddling in the long term.
Experts on the international conference, which were involved in our associations, were not entirely satisfied with the, that we are voluntary vaccines.
This is not an ideal altogether.
On the other hand, we like that managed to impose at least this.
I think that this is the way, which now we must make, he said kalovský.
But the ministry of health care so a vaccine against pneumokokům do not want to change.
In this time of the neuvažujeme at all, he said, his spokesman vlastimil sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine, there are drawbacks, doctors argue
The technical society practical child doctors hana cabrnochová recognizes that it has the voluntary vaccine its disadvantages.
If they were očkovány all children, could be considered a reduction in the number of přeočkování "for the situation, when the vaccine is so high amount, a relatively into political decisions, that it was odstartováno as a voluntary," he says, however, cabrnochová vaccine.
Experts predict that their kojence immunization against pneumokokům from the next year, more than 80% of fresh parents.
Vaccine against pneumokokům is a groundbreaking, and, in that it is as the first blanket immunizations of children paid for the health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, will save the on the other treatment, explains the cabrnochová.
Doctors, will have to buy drugs themselves
With the but do the practical child doctors, which are associated with shopping vaccines.
According to the original purpose should vaccines buy insurance companies, and doctors by dostávali is similarly, as they are state adds to the rest of the vaccine.
But some members of the "feared, so that could insurance companies transfer money from health insurance."
Doctors because they will have to wait to buy a, when they proplatí is insurance companies.
According to estimates of the individual practical 's child will be doctors to invest in vaccines 40 of thousands of a month, which is a significant amount.
This is not a simple, says cabrnochová at all.
Still, they and my

Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when the swiss voters called for the construction of minaretů ban is spreading, and generally, poplašné reports of europe 's supposed islamicize, john bowen, america' s academic wrote a brief and intended, whether the, can integrate the muslims - - and whether to integrate - into one of the nejotevřenějších secular societies of the continent.
Some of this book become obdivovateli readers, after reading autorova of the last works, "why the french do not like to headscarves per capita" (2006), the elegant and diskutovanou study of contested issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years, and whose effects are pociťovány still i today.
The last book mr. bowena has broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist wants to know what politicians and the media said of islam, not only in france, but what is really událo in base.
Spent in mosques, schools, and institutech for months, which is now care about 5 ÷ 6 million of the french muslims, which mr. bowen calls "islamic spaces."
It is a good posluchačem, reprodukuje debate between teachers, and students issues, which is the most worrying.
Muslim should go to the mosque husband union, or the radnici (or in both places)?
It should be young muslim vyučován about development and the rights of gay couple?
Can the muslim vdát for a man, which is not a muslim?
Muslim, has the right to use zájmově - oriented banking system, if it wants to get mortgages?
Are seemingly secular disputed to these questions, which is discussed, and that are part of the daily life rather than the political drama, which employ the media.
Author identifies a new generation of fiery imams and intellectuals, teachers, among other widely known person, including tarika ramadana, araba, muslim scientist and academic, born in switzerland.
This is trying to open discussion of the new generation to at the same time, how can be a good muslim, and good citizen in modern secular society.
The arguments for all of its customs have.
Conservatives are distrustful to real idei french or european of islam.
Philosophers and activists, which mr. bowen conducted interview, on the doměnce, that it is about opposition to selafiho — supporters puristy sunni islam, assembled in the saudské arabia — this group is small, but the impact on european muslims.
Mr. bowen, he believes that the muslim values, and the french secularism - - are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
Asks how far french politicians are (and intellectual elite, which obsessively defending the laickou public) really committed to the idea of pluralism.
Is this view, that muslims have in matters of religion less likely to experience, than catholics and protestants, jews, who also had to make historic compromise to the secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "tightening the screws values."
Can be muslim francouzem? after reading of this book can say "yes, but not someone tendencies have now."
Nejbezútěšnější prospects in the world
The arctic moves faster than the rest of the planet 's environment, dramatically.
Ohraničující led the alarming speed, which has the influence on the animals, and their survival, as a nowhere elsewhere.
The interests of the olejářských, plynařských and water fishing companies must be rigged to the new natural resources, together with diplomats, lawyers, and writer in their awakening.
In his book the "on tenkém ledě" richard ellis, the writer, and ilustrátor, describes natural history of the icon of the north, polárního bear.

Admiral nelson 's meeting with the gallant čtrnáctiletým plavčíkem, who fought with only kolbou muškety is really the myth of the, but everything else is true.
Young bears, who plavali for their bodies were killed mothers, chytáni and zasíláni do zoo and cirkusů.
At the beginning of the 20th century vystupovalo simultaneously in one cirkusovém tent 75 polárních bear.
Even now ohrady in the zoo have typically space milionkrát less than is the region, which are available to adults individuals in the wilds. climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After kliknutí don 't find a more!
Mr. ellis draws from artillery other writers, and historians, and often back to the threat of, that lovci threaten the survival of the species.
Even when it is, banned in norway, america and russia, killing continues in greenland and canada, finland, where the product of helicopters, and indian on the lyžích and all are armed productive invasive ručnicemi, which odstřelují their prey.
The irony is that it is to place in water, and that led to the north from these two lovících nations will eventually the largest.
In my new book "after the ice" alun anderson, the former editor of new scientist, offers a clear and neutěšenou responsibility for the arctic and engaging a cursory glance at to science, as it may be the future of change.
Not all have scientists answers.
Nor meteorologové and oceánografové, have an adequate answer to the velocity of change.
To test for the lack of.

Mrs. sánchezová repeatedly asked to leave the country, to permit could assume permit prices, but it was denied.
America 's detention supplier of may be the result of growing tensions between the communist castro brother, of the ruling on cuba, and obama' s administration, which was sledováno as "in improving relations with the island 's" delaying tactics.
As the first offered a report on the incarceration of new york times in friday at night.
The new american policy, has pointed out that concrete steps, as if the cuban government takes, for example, the release of political prisoners and create a more space for the opposition, the united states will the reciprocal steps.

The case of the five - - which remained in pakistan and was vyslýchána the fbi - - underscores the critical role náborářů to identify potential terrorists, and it may be, which is far more important, measurement of, who is credible.
Since the attacks on september 11, 2001, american intelligence service přiřadila the highest priority of attempts to the human resources into a al - qaeda.

But what remains a hidden for the last of the numbers of national atestačního center for progress in teaching are the continuing differences in achieving knowledge between afroameričany and white students, and to how after the page of local, and the page of national.
Average the outcome of the white students čtvrtých classes of national columbia over the last two years, the increased from 267 to 270 points of (from possible 500), but for their afroamerických vrstevníků came to nrůstu only about the 212 three points, 209.
The difference in achieving knowledge is actually increased from 53 at 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress in eighth class remains essentially balanced, african - americans, statistically inconsequential, one - point with a retreat from 245 to 245.
Average for white students who was not zahrnut in the results of the test of the outcome, because the size of the sample of was not large enough.
The picture in the run six years, is not encouraging.
The difference between the white and black students čtvrtých classes in 2003, when he was carried out the first naep in national, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Even when they reached improve the outcome for children from the oboiu groups during this period, the difference is closer to 58.
Some education in the national advocates in the last week expressed, the results, oslavované tajemnicí michelle a. m. fentym (rheeovou and the mayor adrian d) were rozsáhleji for white students stimulovány, where there were already high results.
To increase by hinting that we are the sum of the support of those at the end of the scale of higher, which is problematic and disturbing, he said, jeff smith, the managing director, d. c. voice, nevýdělečné groups, which defending the equality vdělávání in national.
Neskáču up and down because of rozptylu two or three points, said member of the committee d. c. kwame r. brown (d - at large), which has a girl in the fourth class primary school in eatonu.
Often the case of rheeové, kritizujíce style of mrs. brown notes that reports of the results of test means secondary education is in a desperate condition and requires attention in the city.
It is clear that always you want to see the merits of a i to respect.
But what is horrible, that we are not address almost no time and energy, which was the need to pursue our middle education.
Mrs. rheeová, said that the attempt to national is continuation of in the search for a better ways, aimed at the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are instructed in the use of new curriculum čten, wilsonově reading, targeting system students higher classes of basic schools, and students of secondary schools, who failed to manage the foundations of the reading of previously in their kolní kariéřea has lagged behind its vrstevníky significantly.
Daily mathematics and the curriculum teaching mathematics into the sixth class, stressing of the game, and the experience of real life, which came in for the former director of national clifforda janeyiho, can be added to the progress naep, of which was podána last week 's report.
And now think that we should continue to work, and do what the best intervention in those students, who remain under the levels of class, said of mrs. rheeová.
Other said, the results naep objasnili the question of whether of mrs. rheeová can continue in svyšování overall performance system, and still provide more money, and the means for schools, low - performance, which is necessary for diminished.
This is a vyhraněné the dilemma of mrs. michell rheeové, he said, bruce fuller university, professor of instruction in california at berkeley where studying the results of tests in urban areas.
Conventional the remedy is focus resources, and administrative reforms in schools, placed in the worst parts of the national columbia.
The focus may yield political repercussions, which are against important 's agenda.
But výtka are, however, and the rest of the městským directors, who tried to keep the central prúměr between white and black.
We must focus on the creation of a system of large schools.
We must utužit příbuznost our schools, so that all of the family, regardless of where they live, could rely, to that their children will be provided an excellent public schooling.
Mr. janey, now the director of schools in newark, he said in interview in this week, that the essential element of a reduction in the difference between dosaženými results is the extension of the traditional public school in, currently 180 days in national, to happen, the validity of schools.
You get to 200 days, to promote change, he said, mr. janey, which could make the treaty with its association last year to school teachers year in the length of 185 days, which regards as "sign of the" search for a bigger increase in the next year.
To make a higher education part of a better future

But this is a structural problem, high number of children born, spanish immigrants in the us, who are excluded from the high schools or finds herself pregnant at an inconvenient as nezletilí, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get kolejní, education, and so will enter the middle class.
In one - fifth of this "duhé generation" spanish students from koleje - remarkable reached the results of udávají, that many of their immigrant parents, most mexicans and central america 's population, came to the united states, without by, high school.
Their story of success is important, say, because it highlights the researchers their point the way forward for generation, which have played a relatively minor role in the country 's labor force.

Gates: iran faces another sanctions
Secretary of defense robert gates m. said in place, the world 's powers will soon imposes sanctions on iran "another major" because of the lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, which he spoke to a group of about 300 american soldiers in northern iraq during the week of the way for areas where the war in afganistánu, and iraq, disparaged the prospect of the armed actions against the islamic republic.
This is not a good choice for iran, said in the answers to question the soldier on the likely development. ¨
One of the issues, which depends on whether to me, is the, i learned about something from iraq for the past six years, [a] is neodmyslitelná unpredictability in the war.
The obama administration decides u package sanctions, which could reach iránskou military and political elite, but the gates signaling that some of these sanctions could also to crystallize the ordinary iránce.
He said, "a package of incentives and constraint" that would require "to persuade iránskou, to really felt less safe government with nuclear weapons," because the "its people will be extremely suffer from" sanctions.
According to pátečního position, which embarked on a white house secretary robert gibbs administration engaged european leaders do warning that iran will bear serious consequences, if neuvede its nuclear program to a full conformity with un committee for nuclear security and his dozorčím body, the international atomic energy agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop their expertise only for peaceful purposes.
At the talks in geneva on october 1, suggested that it wants to return to the talks to limit its nuclear program and agreed with the, that will provide a significant part of their reserves enriched uranium in exchange for urgently need to fuel for the reactor to the conduct of medical research.
Administration has done for such as a way for the establishment of a trust agreement between the two sides, and to win the time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, iran odstupuje from interim agreements - - partly because, expert, because irámské leadership is divided on the views on whether to engage in the united states.
Frankly, if the concerns iránské tvrdošíjnosti to the international community in the case of some proposals, which really agreed at the beginning of the october, i believe that led to the international community, including the russians, and the chinese together on the way, which is not about terminology additional sanctions against iráncům, he said, gates.
President obama set on december 31. to the final term for iran, responded to proposals before the return to the search for other elections, including surveillance, which us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton once nazvala "degradujícími sanctions."
In view, the un 's vydaném in new york, iránská mission in condemned the in - to, what nazvala "neopodstatněnými and nepodloženými" from some members of the security committee on charges iránských nuclear activities, and said that he wants to continue in talks with the united states, and five other the world' s major powers "to achieve a přiměřeného long - term solutions.
Gates, who returned to washington last friday, met with the morning with the iraqi prime minister nouri al - maliki before the, than flew to the area of kurdistan, oil - rich, to be met with troops in kirkuku and with kurdish leaders in irbilu.
There remains high tensions between the kurds, and iraq 's arab majority, particularly because of the borders of, vlastnickým rights, and distribution of income.
Gtes pressed on both sides, to reduce the capabilities for conflict, zabránlo delaying plans to the us on restrictions on the number of american troops from 115000 on august 50000 in the end of the.
Gates, also tried to cushion the kurdish concerns about the continuing depression. official told jobs cited gates, when the us massoudu barzáanímu, president kurdistánské regional governments: "we want to protect your security, prosperity, and autonomiji in united in iraq.
We do not want to leave you. "
In an aging china, a change of exchange - rate
Wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propagandistickými posters, to read, "mother country is too exhausted, more children to fund" and "one child, moreover, moreover," means one grave.
A lesson, then, that the official when government jobs in shanghai, alarmována low birth rates and aging populations in their capital, suddenly changed course in this summer, and encourage young couples, their response was never an immediate and determined:.
We have always been paying all their time and energy is one child.
Nothing, we will be for the second, says wang 31 years, the human resources, which has 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of china 's have only one - child policy, the only by putting a generation or two notoriously boubelatých was introduced a zhýčkaných children, afektovaně dubbed "small threatens emperors", a country' s population crisis.
A child 's average fertility rates declined to 1.8 on a few compared to the six, than vpolitika vsoupila in effect, according to the un' s data.
The division of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years, and higher is, to predict that violently naroste from 16,7% of the population in 2020 to 31,1% in 2050. this is far above the overall average of around 20%.
An imbalance of is greater rich coastal cities with populations with vysokoškolským education, for example, in shanghai.
People aged 60 years, and higher last year were almost 22% in shanghai registered of the population, while the fertility rate was less than one child in a few.
Xie lingli, the director of the commission 's shanghai urban population and family planning said, "many couples must have children to help reduce the proporci an aging population and reducing početního of the state of the labor force in the future."
, says that he is to about "to be the old, this does not mean a rich - - as in developed countries, such as japan, and sweden."
The gradual uklidňování
In 1978, as was the country 's vloženo in the constitution, china' s one - child policy is probably the most controversial mandate today, established under the communist party.
A pair of that violated, face great fines policy - - - three times their annual salary in some areas - - and discrimination in work.
China 's official jobs for policy, which helped to prevent the country critical drawing natural resources, while defenders of the human rights were odsuzováni in promoting policies.
In rural areas of some officials forcing the těhotné women in the second child submit to abortion.
Moreover, many a pair of had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an artificially high men 'relative to women.
In the past few years, the population officials were gradually milder in his position to the one - child policy.
In 2004, typically povolovali výce exceptions - - including the population 's cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases, when jedináčky were a man or woman - - and mitigate its substantial entries in 2007, prosazujících hard - line.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor at beijing university research institute of population, said that the central government officials before debated of radikálnějších changes, as allowing párům that should be two children, as long as one of the partners was jedináček.
In june, šanghai became the first, china 's capital, which spustilo aggressive for incitement to more porodům campaign.
Were posters almost overnight, nabádající parents, to have only one child, replaced by those regulations, in detail words, how would be justified to have the second a child, and how to apply to permit.
City administration officials sent for planning families and volunteers, to setkávali with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the door.
Promised also provide the emotional and financial counseling for those that have decided to have more than one child.
The response was games, said officials for planning families.
Zarmucující response
Even when officials in the city in the rest of the one venkovském shanghai saw an increase in the interest of u -, would have wanted some of the second child after the start of the campaign, most of the urban nationwide nehlásila change.
Urban district huinan with populations 115000, for example, still registered four or five cases as a month.
Disillusioned with officials in shanghai said that, despite the campaign, the number of born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng juying, the leaders of the committee for planning families in shanghai čtvti caolu said that the financial considerations probably be the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best to the first a child, he said.
Yang jiawei, 27 years, and his wife, liu juanjuan, 26 years, said that, should be two children, and i 'd be happy to them to legally were allowed.
But as many of the chinese, who have only lack of health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without dociální záchytné network of could be a choice of irresponsible.
People in the west measured one - child policy badly as disputed legal question, yang, building inženýr, whose a woman in the seventh months ago pregnancy in a union with the first is a baby.
Yes, we were ochuzeni about a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples report psychological reasons hesitation.
Wang, the human resources, says that chtejí only one child, because it was also jedináček: "we were the center of attention our families, and all of us cleaned.
They were in fact, we používáni for the provision of care, and we did not want to care for the second.
Chen zijian, 42, which vlatní překladatelskou society, to put it much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové parents from the middle class, who, lower fertility rates, said to be successful means to be self -.
Today 's 20 and 30letí dorůstající nahlížejí on parents as a probíjející, the first days číského experiment with capitalism, and they don' t want to be this way of živita for themselves, he says.
This is one child puts enormous demands on time parents, he says.
Two years of his mother must sacrifice minimal social life.
Then there are still disputed questions propstoru - - "you have to rebuild your apartment" - - a strategy - - "you must be resumé prepared in a time when it is a child for good preschool 9 months of education.
Most of its friends wants to settle with one child, says che, but not the two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We don 't want to make too many victims.
The un 's group outlined plan to cut carbon emissions.
The un sponzorovaná conference on climate - - charakterizovaná far - reaching neukázněnými attitude and each other osočováním - - again in friday focus on to relax document, which proposes an ambitious cuts of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations, nesoucími most of the burden - sharing in the near term.
The text, which can provide the starting point for the ultimate political agreement for the regulation of greenhouse gases, emphasizes the remaining barriers as well as provides the explanation way forward.
But it was important progress in the negotiations, which was evident in the wrong time with more than 100 the world 's leaders, who will come next week in copenhagen.
Created the un ad hoc working group, the text inconspicuously, how much money by rich countries should provide the poor for dealing with global warming in the short run, and in the long run.
A provides the full range of elections for the key issues, including, how to develop and manage emerging economies could reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit the increase in global temperature, which political leaders even will be able to tolerate.
To dodábá process of great flexibility, says the club, john coequyt high representative of the washington 's sierra.
Michael zammit cutajar, which proposed šestistránkový document, zestručnění from 180 aspects of the text of the negotiations to focus on what cutting - edge official on the issues at the un climate, yvo de boer, described as "the big picture of".
Nastiňuje outlines for possible agreement, in which might reduce the industrial nations together by their emissions by 25 - 45% in relative to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15% to 30% of the.
Together by countries to reduce emissions by 2050 between $50 a 95%.
The quickly in place the promise of, that the european union will provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years, to help poorer countries to adopt a adapting to climate change - - - from handling of floods and droughts, to prevent deforestation.
But still friday said the same kind of verbálních ohňostrojů, which prevailed in talks in the last week.
The us special envoy for the climate todd stern rejected the speech, requiring binding constraints on emissions of greenhouse gases for industrial countries in comparison with the dobrovolností for the major emerging economies, if would not be financed developed world.
The shift imply that the obama administration nastolila tougher line to the bush administration 's china bež officials from the two years ago.
The united states do not agree on the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries, and take action, he said, stern, which also complained that the text, it is not enough to safeguard constraints, and it should be prověřen external observers.
Stern made this hour comment after china 's deputy secretary of state he told yafei america' s main climate negotiators issues that either the lack of "common sense," or "exceptional" led 'irresponsibility earlier in the week to the message that the united states would help financially china, to deal with global warming.
With the future of economic course of the world 's major powers imbroglio erupted in at stake, both within the developing world, and between the industrial world, and the emerging economies.
Recent boj is mostly the preservation of individual economies, rather than the preservation of the planet, between china and the united states about fulfillment of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations highlight to ignore the scientific imperative that two dozens of the most countries of the world for a stronger actions.
Ricardo ulate, delegát costa rica, he said that it is not surprising that the main powers are about to, who should bear the costs of the omezováníí in greenhouse gases, while the country 's vulnerable become far more aggressive in the search for a way to zak preserving the big issuers in their actions.
This is clearly game on to the new economic hegemony, evolves, he said, ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser, in the area of regional climate change in mexico, and the central america for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are the most zranitelnelné the effects of climate change, indicating that it would be to continue to promote the legally binding treaty in copenhagen this december, but most of the main participants in, say, the result that the best talks will be a political agreement.
An alliance of small ostrovních states, which has created a 24stránkový proposal agreement last 43 members, friday morning.
Artur runge - metzger, which led to the international negotiations on climate in favor of the european commission, he said, that the pursuit of small ostrovních nations "created a political party tlkak on the polirtický process of", partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies, such as china and india.
Negotiations has produced a new urgency, when the delegates focused on the fact that must resolve a majority of the remaining contested issues before the heads of government utkají for an agreement.
Senior officials, such as india 's minister of environmental protection, for example, jairam rameš and china' s deputy secretary of the left of aircraft, and proběhli halami center bella to zavřeným doors a meeting of a new conferences so could set a claims, which will be posouzeny next week.
Complete rozsáhlost assembly - when the 13000 people přemisťovalo each from, and to kongresového center, kytary playing on inscenovali activists in the night of ironizující the spectacle of countries, for which the thought that it is committed to the proposals of hand in hand, and take place on paper, rather than an community - - dominated by challenge.
Intensity is only nadstavbou: were present in copenhagen in almost all of the key ministers and before the center of the 60 heads of states.
We have to high categories, he said, carlos manuel rodriguez, he said, deputy minister for global policy for international conservation.

The association of udf increases the tone and calls for the party nouveau centre, to nepožívala their shortcut.
The association of udf, controlled party modemfrançoise bayrou, in place to respond to the president of the party 's attempt nouveau centre, hervého morina on přivlastnění shortcuts ex - giscardovy party with the, that shortcut must use in no médiu under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé morin publicly announced its intention to steal shortcut udf with the, that the françois bayrou, does not deserve a bear its legacy after what reach out to the left.
Secretary of defense, whose party, it is a partner in the ump, he should in this strategy reaffirm in the advice of saturday before a national movement 's plan nouveau centre (nc).
This his step received support in the hervého de charetta (the former behind - the ump now for nc), which attributed to the ownership of udf brands, because it is allowed to register in the national institute in 2004, as the first industrial ownership of (l 'national institute de la propriété industrielle).
But in place the evening, the committee of the commonwealth of udf governed by friends, françois bayrou, who do not intend to expropriate, he broke from its silence and submitting a formal request minister i mps, to stop using short cut back and a protective signs of ownership, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In the last days you are an increase in worrying statements about that navrhnete its political movement + + shortcut udf to take over again, he wrote in his letter to the podepsaném 19 those from 24 members of the committee, from which, for example, françois bayrou, and marielle de sarnez from the alliance parties modem or senator jean arthuis centriste.
At the same time you are regarded as appropriate placed on their marketing materials and movement in uvítací internet site of your name + nouveau centre +, today 's, the slogan + udf +, argue also signatories letter.
How is known, you don 't have no right to use this shortcut, explains the committee udf, which requires movement nc "now remove all references the names of udf from all marketing material, including (its) web sites."
It also requires hervého de charettea "to the property protective signs of legitimate owners."
If so neučiníte, to turn to the courts, to be respected law, and a legitimate rights members of the udf highlight signatories.
In his letter to argue that udf "is full of political hnutíod of 1978," and to remind, mr. morin and its friends "elected" the departure of the movement in 2007, "to create a competitive, like others in 2002, to establish the ump.
The movement nouveau centre, so there is no use according to the right to them, no shortcut udf (union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time charge that the last congress in 2007, udf voted for joining the modem on three years, and the charge of defend committee for the creation of a "moral and material interests" associations - based valery giscard d 'estaing.
When it comes to hervého de charettea continues, the commission, "when zaregistroval protective sign of the" three years, "which was not a member of the udf", but the ump.
Skandálním and fraudulent in a way to take advantage of existent registration akronyma, to do so on their own account.
This netaktnost is beginning to convert to the crime of, say, and then express with irony nc: "strategy to the us, it seems that in both politics, and in the normal life is valuable to create a name for itself, than to leave the anonymity fraudulent, by adopting the names of, on which we do not have the right."
The case of the liliane bettencourtové: françois - marie banier will be put on trial for the abuse of state of weakness.
The court in nanterre in friday decided to prosecute artists françois - marie baniera and bring judgment, whether to take advantage of the state of the weakness of the osmdesátileté miliardářky to it, to prepare the part of its wealth, which accuses him of its year - old daughter liliane bettencourtová.
Fotograf (62 years), known their photos of the famous will be tried 15 april 16. 2010, and the abuse of the state of weakness, which is the crime, which is stored in the best the duration of the 3 years and pokuta of $375 €.
Indeed, this decision confirms that occur in the process, which can be described as a family ságu one of the richest families in france, in which with each other assail the mother daughter, and are struggling to manage the kosmetického empire l 'oreal.
But 15. criminal court at the same time, medical ordered an investigation 87 leté liliany bettencourtové, which should do kolegium of the three doctors.
Heir, and the main akcionářka society l 'oreal always refused to undertake such testing, certainly not in terms offered state zastupitelstvím of nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors, who will be elected in place, should develop report in march 10. 2010, and also to the expression of, whether the liliana bettencourtová could find in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think that it will.
A things with promluvím, he argued for an end to hearing advocate of mrs. bettencourtové georges kiejman.
When it comes to a lawyer françois bettencourtové - meyersové, olivier have metznera, the court 's decision.
It is to výborná report (....). expertiza prove that the old dámou with this, which needs to protect the, manipuloval (m. banier), confirmed.
Two years, what are the only one year - old daughter liliany bettencourtové launched a criminal proceedings against françois - marie banierovi, fotografovi for years, and všeumělci, who blame the, that used the state of the weakness of its mothers, to gain the gift billion euros form of checks on life insurance contracts or images champions.
While liliane bettencourtová always refused to, that would be fotografem, which is seen as a long - term friend, manipulována.
While the court judge the legitimacy of the action podané of mrs. bettencourtovou - meyersovou, we friday judicial speech in family hour, at times turned the truth.
Advocate liliany bettencourtové put forward three letters, his klientka (in 1999, 2003, and sent 2005) their notaries, and in which expressed their distrust of husband françoisy bettencourtové - meyersové.
In a letter to the in 2003, liliane bettencourtová according to a lawyer adds,: "you my daughter to explain that i could banierovi wrote for 15 years of one - day twice.
Since then, what vdala, i am with françois could never have the phrase ".
Once again, the state zastupitelství in nanterre found that stěžovatelky is justified, negotiations on to more rejected her request that the opatrovnický judges in these days of the start of governance to the publication of legal protection for its mother.
Liliane bettencourtová "is quite able to participate in the court, it is not under the protection of the or in guardianship.
No one for it will act ", confirmed leader prosecutor, marie - christine daubigneyová.
The court decided, ultimately, to express sense of mrs. bettencourtové - - meyersové at the time of the launch of the process.
Manažerská revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing will not change in the management of large french companies, our struggle for economic development of the intelligentsia was unnecessary....
For more than a decade, reminiscent of the behavior of the management of the big companies to workers approach firms to consumers to the marketingovou revolution: it is about to, associates ztotožnili with "to the values of a mountain avenues," as before, when it was to be consumers impose products, which resulted from the ideas of heads of factory engineers.
By that has become a center of business client societies, srovnala marketing revolution development strategy of the market in the right direction.... i when authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from zákaznických preferences, regularly returning!
Passive approach workers can lead to terminal demoralization.
France 's telecom, dog or renault suicides in firms are only visible part of a widening universal phenomenon, which is hitting mostly managerial cadres.
This demobilization unfavorably affects the development of all the intellectual functions society, including the research and development, and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
And, indeed, ei "requires from all concerned parties (....) requires active approach, and the ability to predict a" and from workers commitments, which are fully in violation of the income authoritarian management.
Because we call on to the managerial revolution, which would have to implement the goal of the workers in the center of a firm 's interest as well as the clients.
Relative utility domestic public opinion polls.
Internal public opinion polls - - as dotazník submitted to employees firms orange - - contribute to the revolution in government techniques?
Unfortunately, i worry, that is not.
Mainly because, that i himself convinced of the structure of after that, in the face of the new situation is different odbočení triage return to the.... what always did!
Because, that authoritarianism, as one of pathology power, proportionally increases the importance of their own failures.
Finally, because most of the řídících workers have a facile view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates high schools for the engineers, have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of intellectual convenience now take the old behavioristickou theory, in oživenou again "neurovědami" from the us and the abundant without larger scientific knowledge of the constitution and the media.
With the, that it is possible to move "levers" (sic) integration managers, a recent poll showed ipsos at sites figaro. the fed agency, which only descent executives, in their position mechanical management, improper for today 's world.
Identify a measure of factors mobilization.
On the contrary, manažerská revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, assumes accepting the final vision of human behavior.
Lies in the inclusion of the basic observation of all intentions and practice management: for workers will be the commitments to firm will be possible only if seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
In the current time, this concept of the workers concerned with the only study motivačně functional analysis.
These studies have shown that assesses its businesses on the basis of the pre - designed doxy, which would allow them to, through the firm 's image, which to assess says,, what offers to implement their life goals.
Thanks to identify and measurement of these factors mobilization can executives control, predictable, and the anticipovat in their "social výkonech" and implement its management human resources, "on the right way."
By creating a breeding ground for the development of a solid and effective economic intelligence.
The oslo manifestation of the: "just war" obama praised by the right.
America 's right in the friday welcome a speech that barack obama made the day before the in oslo, satisfied with the, that holder of the nobel peace prize for 2009 defended the concept of "fair" war against the enemies of the united states.
Conservatives, who initially vysmívali award of obama 's october 9. prices, this time presidential applauded, including sarah palin' s speech on viceprezidentku in elections in 2008, the former list.
Like the, has said palin told me, what, múza right - wing republican wings, for the us today and supplied that she is to put this issue of "sometimes necessary to" war in his memoirs, which is based.
War is, of course, the last thing, which by americans want to work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists, there is a need to restrain believe.
President barack obama, which he inherited two wars in afghanistan and iraq after his předchůdcigeorge w. bush, justified in - the oslo deploying forces, and to take advantage of speech to the objasnění his decision to send other 30 nine days before the 000 soldiers in afghanistan.
Another obama 's adversary, newt gingrich, assessed, that president did in the oslo "very good work."
I think that the speech was a very good, congratulate former president of the house of representatives, the president 's a reference to ", above all, who praised the existence of evil" in the world.
In a way i saw this speech for a historic, declared gingrich during the course of a conversation in the agenda of radio "the takeaway."
Former deputy, by some as a possible republican candidate in the presidential election in 2012, was happy that president "see" of the left to remind members of the committee for the nobel prize, "that they would not free, and could not to deliver price for peace, use of force if there were no."
According to michael gersona former the author of george w. bush, now editor washington post, obama made "very america 's speech".
Not only is presented as a "world" as always, but he spoke "as europeans" reminded us president, "and that they live in a safe, which they created a bubble that do not too much to the" to maintain it, "assessed gerson.
The few disaffected from the right include hawk bush era, the former ambassador to the un, john bolton, which speech called for "jednotvárný, pompous and without inspiration put it," as on the web pages of national review online.
The left from the president, for example, the democratic reprezentant dennis kucinich is appalled in view of barack obama, as justifies the use of force.
"when the war zabalíme do repackaged justice, we can easily odůvodnit the massacre of innocent people,", had warned.
Nevertheless, the medium - left - wing press advocate of president laudatory position.
Although los angeles times and continue to see the award of peace obama prices for early, assessed his output as a "nadvýkon" and to, speaker known for their talent.
The oslo speech should serve as a návod to international decisions in the resolution of conflicts, in the fight against poverty and útlakem ", passionate, california 's daily.
Obama "made a sign of what was to be", assessed new york times, a sign of called "as a simple and instructive."

But it was the need for more than six hours meeting, which began in 11 hours, all agreed to a podepsaliznění agreement in the 18 hours.
This conflict "by enterprises very ublížil" and "threatened by the danger that will be narušeny holidays at the end of the year," he said bussereau.
Version of the text contains wage increases about 4% in the lowest salaries (in the local and regional road transport), and about the 2.9% of the highest salaries (international right).
Hourly wage at the lowest wage increases from €8,72 to 9,06.
It is not to many, but it is for the many efforts, explained patrice clos (fo).
Now evening, we 'll our members orders, in order to avoid blockades, no blockade of zásobovacích center.
But it can occur even a few opponents, who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe grillot, president of the tlf have, "the right" agreement, and when it was difficult to admit an increase in high salaries, given the international competition ".
According to him, it comes to an increase in about €170 month in the lowest wages and about €100 - 120 for those of the top.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said cmaxime dumont (thierry douine (cftc) welcomed the cfdt), while "historic deal".
According to the richard jauberta (cgt), it is a "acceptable compromise."
Agreement also implies revalorizaci travel spending of $3% and report on the situation of the state of the road transport in the first half of the 2010, which would allow also focus on the question of 13. salary and modernize collective of the treaty.
Bussereau reminded the "reduction of about €100 million in taxes on wages enterprises" that was the subject of pozměňovacího of the draft 's governments to the budget in 2009, about which bill voted in night from čtvrtka to place the national assembly.
Government requests the senate about "equal" vote.
The signature allows, that this agreement will apply soon as possible to businesses, which are members of this organizations, later in the field, in the case of enlargement of the us department of labor.
Take place in what nejkratším date, "", bussereau assured.
The entire process can put brakes only disapproval organizations employers.
The organization of the fntr talk about the "bad trade" as €100 million "has already been sector offered to within the framework of compensation part of the carbon taxes."
State secretary for transport forced us to nouzovému negotiations, but because, rather than as a result of mutual analysis to nerozhněval jedlíky krůty at a time of the forthcoming vánočních svátků, complained unostra.
For the organization otre, the danger is that the agreement in the next 12 months. "burying the large number of small and medium - sized enterprises from the field."

Important nákupního in saturday, and the sunday, the days before christmas, will be during the weekends trains run only between 10, and 20. hour, on the main úseku (between la défence a nation) will run every other train, out of this portion of only one of the four train.
The connection sncf will be přerušeno in nanterre préfecture and consumers and will be forced to přestoupit to another train.
Trade homes galeries lafayette every day, which expect more than 200,000 customers welcomed by the fact that "the ratp to the zajištěníspojení with a large trade houses."
Line, rer and leads from the west to east paris aglomerace.
Portion of spravovaný ratp leads from saint - germain - en - laye and nanterre do boissy - saint - léger and marne - la - vallée.
In place, it was in the top of the in one of the two train and virtually no souprava nejezdila in a time of outside the tip of a, as was the plan.
Like the in - the people of ile de france zařídili differently, and to nástupištích nevládl confusion.
So soon morning was in the station saint - germain - en - laye (yvelines) far less than usual, among others, therefore, that people chyběli students and students.
Jack nbakina, inženýr, 29 years of boissy - saint - léger (cordon sanitaire - de - marne), explained that arose a "hour, and a half before, to be sure, that arrive in time."
Apart saint - lazare was not přeplněno railways, announced the state sncf, to forecast the greater the number of zřízenců and the guardians of order.
Commuter trains rer and operated sncf in the direction of or do cergy - le - haut přijížděly apart saint - - or odjížděly from lazare with přípojem on subway.
Another much of the assembly strike will be held in saturday, and sunday, which will be to evaluate the results of pátečního odpoledního meeting with the leadership of the, which ohodnotily as a "weak" trade unions.

Stuttgartská drag on
Dimensions of stuttgart 21 is not enough to prepare at all.
For supporters project, it is simply a "new the heart of europe."
Well. s21 is more than the launch of the apart, more than monstrózní pushing the structure, which the main city of bádenska - - the württemberska do desperate building chaos on the one decade.
Stuttgart 21 from the spirit of the 1980 's.
Hlavové with kolejemi station, which ended in the center of the city, were regarded as dopravně - technical fosílie 19th century, they operate as a brake job modern kolejové transport, because it was the need to massively much time to přepřáhnutí rolling lokomotiv ahead.
Zajet, a moment to stop, go further - - and it should work.
And so are disappearing hlavová apart: a munich in frankfurt.
And, in stuttgartu: apart, which is roughly in the mid - průjezdní route transevropské rail magistrály between paris and budapeští / bratislavou - - because the slogan "the heart of europe."
Indeed, beginning to s21, although the vision of the 1980 's are no longer compatible with the reality.
A very ambitious engineers know that, in hesenském themselves and bavorském velkoměstě is the construction of almost neufinancovatelné.
Since then, there are modern kyvadlové trains with what motorovými and řídícími vehicle at both ends of the apart the problems, have hlavová zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Yet: begins to stuttgartem 21, including new race ice in the ulmu.
Further to zemští and communal politicians.
Railways, working together, and that the risks of the biggest individual project infrastructure in republic is not a state koncern taxpayers.
Even in some way excuse for urbanisticky can be project.
A new urban land, which - - if we believe počítačovým obrázkům projektantů - - will contain many greener.
For the rail transport system is s21 harmful.
Průjezdné bahnhof, and construction of race are designed for personal transportation, which - - typically - - to a massive increase in the 1980 's.
Then there was no competition cheap flights.
But modern transport policy must go to strengthen freight traffic in the first place, because the rail transport, it is far more ekologičtější than cargo automobilová on the road.
But the new link is not due to a sharp stoupáním appropriate for the truck trains.
Even more serious is that s21 indirectly touches lots of other of railroad projects.
In the euro švábsku should be zahrabat good six billion.
This is the official number.
Experts as a real 10 - 15 billion.
It is clear that, in the next decade will be lack the finance on the other uzlové body and close jobs in network.
On the list of the ministry of transport is sixty - larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of the roughly 180 kilometers long route valley most.
Building on this route from the 1987 down in slow pace.
Here, needed to be properly force.
But s21 will be a drag on the.
Link valley most will become hrdlem bottle international freight traffic: directly in the heart of europe.

After all, it was to faster, than expected.
Presented just two weeks after 's successor, what the station zdf supplant from the office of the council the editor of the nikolause brendera.
Yesterday 's night, one grémium agree on a person.
For the front - runner was presented peter frey, study zdf in the city 's leaders in berlin.
But to nepotvrdila - - officially station, to nepředbíhala process.
But could also play a role that did not want to destroy intendanta zdf markuse schächtera, if in the board of this proposal would not.
Frey, schächterův candidate, it needs support from 14 members of the grémia nine.
The outcome of the vote was not known uzávěrkou this issue.

For seven brendera voted only seven members, was against him. brenderova loss of mandate was, for schächtera bitter defeat, although it is the expected.
Eu majority in the council, signaled several weeks before the election that does not want to reaffirm the brendera in office.
Opposition to the editor - organized hesenský prime minister, roland koch.
Refused to other staying in the office of high - weighted the editor of the argument that for brendera fell quotas tracking news broadcasts zdf.
Until the shortly before the choice, because the protests, in which was sharply criticized political influence on zdf.
Recently, in the debate vmísilo even 35 státoprávních lawyers, who kochův as unconstitutional assess progress.
This was not useless.
A person
Peter frey was born on august 4. 1957 in bingenu.
Studied the policy, a pedagogiku, and romanistiku.
Then worked for a südwestfunk and frankfurter rundschau.
1983 moved frey do zdf, first do "heute - journal."

Then, what brender, which was elected technical periodikem at the center of the medium magazin novinářem in, deposed, the greens, declared that shake constitutional claim.
Kochův opponent in the council, rýnsko - falcký prime minister kurt beck last week 's, explained that country' s federal should change state, the treaty is so, to zdf personnel proposals intendanta could not be blokovány politically motivated majority.
Beck but also refused to the exclusion of party politicians of supervisory the advice of the zdf.
Brenderův předpokládaný peter frey successor to the council poroučel chytrým šachovým fell - immediately after the toppling of brendera strongly grémium criticized for this.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence it could in place of the editor of the nominovat without losing face could be elected as well as schächter, the council, without by came into the suspicion, that would be straník protlačen into office.

Studies of the deprives harampádí
Finally zajeli part success for students: after strike in - into the country 's ministers of the culture: at the conference ministers culture and university presidents, both sides agreed on the, that is the will of the improve academic conditions for bakaláře and magistry.
Students should be able to manage to their studying in the future.
In particular, they agreed that the zredukuje burden tests: is fundamentally every study modul to put an end to one should be the only test.
In addition, should be překontrolovat labor burden studying, and should be guaranteed by the "real, and obhajitelná rate of".
Politicians and high school want to simplify recognition of tests between universities in germany, and abroad.
The country 's federal commit to create a more flexible common organizing looking for bakalářské and magisterské academic disciplines.
Local variations should stop there.
Less tests
From the start of the student protests in červu should ministers of culture and university rektoři in the mouths okřídlená words about a better study.
Now they are for the first time satisfy the specific content.
The so - called akreditační council usnesla, that the number of trials partly drastically zredukuje: "everyone modul typically stopped will be only one test," writes in 30 - stránkové report, which is partly a newly regulate endorsing academic disciplines.
"significantly lower zkouškovou burdens," said the chairman of the council 's akreditační reinhold grimm, is to be halted by the wrong development, "which significantly intensiveness of the study."
To do is to be "intensiveness of the study of" in the future, "the key criterion" in the conduct of.
Moduly and content "must be hard překontrolovat" in order to "unnecessarily neomezovaly student in choice
The seminaries. "
Students should "claim on the space, which allows and supports the" their own initiative.
The rules of pay are in endorsing new academic disciplines, after a review, but also for the existing academic disciplines.
The need to be "přeakreditovat" - - which every five years, however, means that it will take by 2015, than překontrolovány will be all academic disciplines.
Around the germany is responsible for the to ten akreditačních agencies, which are subject to akreditačním advice zřízenými spolkovými countries.
Ministers culture, "strongly" of the country in october, to agencies worked so, to around učiva was too much, and zkouškový regime was made.
In the länder countries, the universities and high school agreed zemskými minister of the appropriate measures.
As a single country has přislíbilo the rhineland - falcko additional resources for further development boloňského process.
In the money by high schools should pay for the consultative programs, and the study advice, above all, and strengthen the democrats and cizinecké authorities.
On the euro to want to spend ten million countries, and high school.
At the beginning of the vládat can do it wants to parliament by 2010 novelu university law.
According to it by the end of the study modulu should be needed only one test.
Shaping the study by should be even more flexible, to test is to be a guaranteed recognition from other high schools and easier to be available magistra.
In the end of next year, should be překontrolována intensiveness of all the academic disciplines, in the country.
Once again, the government and opposition to the in - dohadovaly of academic conditions in the country.
In addition to praise the also criticism of the decisions.
The federal a university groups juso vyzvalo, to the creation of the politics of education neodehrávala "behind closed doors" in the future of ministers, and university presidents.
After the latest strike would also speak of "should at least slovíčko" students as the relevant person.
Scholars have also support from the future prezidentky conference university presidents (hrk), margrety wintermantelové: "we need the experience of students," said in - the one encounters with ministry culture, which hrk on common reform report.
According to the trade unions education and science (gew) nešla bonnská resolution go far enough: demanding legal claim that everyone absolventovi with bakalářským would allow the title access to nástavbové magisterské study.
Second, the country must ensure that for today 's generation of students bakalářský disciplines, was available tomorrow enough jobs in magisterských academic disciplines, with what the best studijními conditions, he said, member of the gew andreas keller.
The federal far more driving the country must be employed.
Ministers culture, but to free access to the magisterských nevyjádřili programs.
More than remark under line to hertě müllerové
Get out in germany, and it is a nice, almost no control... "is the initial řádek one the poet wernera söllnera, which in this vytrženém language fragment of with experience with přicestováním one dissident, who gained freedom, at the same time, but their linguistic backgrounds.
Werner söllner was born in 1951, in romania banátu worked in bucharest, first as němčiny teacher and english, and, later, lektor one child knižního nakladatelství, 1982 then moved in frankfurt over mohanem.
Söllner was vyznamenán different literárními prices, 1993 lecturing poetry to the legendary frankfurt goetheho university, and is the leadership of the hesenského since 2002 fóry literature in mousonturm in frankfurt.
The large mimoliterární concern care of the past tuesday he on one seminar in munich, in which it was a "german literature in romania in the mirror, and the rozbitém the mirror of its security act of".
Obviously znejistělý, and zaražený söllner left statements, in which the writer rumunskými the germans, including colleagues. richard wagnerem, william totokem, franzem hodjakem and helmuthem frauendorferem, according to cooperation as a secret the informant romanian securitate the intelligence services.
Together with some of the present, the german linguistic price söllner in 1989.
Attempts to naverbování started inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I, continued söllner, "- - someone who stopped sufficiently attempts to intimidation from the securitate."
The poet werner walter söllner is secret agent.
Almost at the same time, by granting the nobel prize hertě müllerové and its bezpříkladným literárním literary scene is addressing the underlying mechanisms of dictatorial governments, and romania 's community of germany' s authors who come from, in particular, which calls hlubiny and hanebnost political sytému shaken case, which is based on control, and špicování.
Werner söllner is not, at least if it can be said, according to the state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but it is also the victims.
In aktech securitate men, secret agent walter some played a role, he said, after söllnerově recognition of michael markel a secret agent of walter odkázal a positive impact on them.
"vysekával" me for him, then, in all the more fundamental points, says the markel.
Has a moral obligation to do this note.
Söllnerovo statement was in the form of a before this audiences unexpectedly, but very surprising recognition of the former dissident and his cooperation with romania 's secret service is not.
Herta müllerová wrote in july, when četla their own akta, 914 parties, that germany was comfortable reserves for špicly securitate.
Concerned, one can assume, will be speculate about know that, and, in some cases, the name of lies behind krycím on behalf of the sorin, voicu, and it is also walter.
Otherwise, than in tuzemském, meanwhile, the very a prohlédnutí forces stazi, manipulation is with the pozůstalostí control securitate even a very difúzní.
In the past, systematic education mařena, and was restricted.
One of the birthlerových authorities, which corresponds to the national the council for processing forces securitate (cnsas), was based only in 1999, the publication of an act of the length rather than ever since.
Only since 2005, there is a law, which controls the administration forces.
That former securitate members have even still much influence in romania, showed after publication of the nobel prize for hertu müllerovou one conversation, in which one of the former bosses securitate men of timisoara put it nositelce unappreciated by about.
After all, supposedly, psychosis, was vyslýchána only one.
There is potupení power, expressed a nezakrytě in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that is so as to the case of söllner, in the context of zamlčeným offense, is associated the inevitable questions.
Why until now? who? harm special listeners' s response to the söllnerovo confession allowed to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than for přiřknutí guilt and shame.
To genezi works herty müllerové, which adopted the nobel prize, is to more than yesterday remark under the line.

Worlds dreams
Some see in the awake images of a hearing voices, which others see a hear.
Not only mentally ill, or in the drug opojení coincide borders between imagination a reality.
As long as this is to place in his sleep, everything is in order.
If ležíme closed eyes in our tmavém room, smíme surround oneself nejdivočejšími beliefs and fantazijními delusions.
But who is experiencing in vigilantes snové conditions, hear and see things that others see a hear, is true in today 's most of the western world for blázna or drug dependent, or at least as a maverick.
But such images of a voices not only in the mentally ill, or in the drug opojení.
Blame is our imagination: the same neuronální processes that enable us to propose homes, malovat images of or written about novels, there is, and where up to the limits of the splynou between a dream, the idea of a a reality.
Dreams changed the knowledge can occur in various forms of, in a better case we say, in worse bludy 's vision of them.
Even when the initiator, and the effect of may differ, but can the vision of a mystičky hildegard von bingen, drug experiences of the prophet new - age carlos castanedy, blouznění šamanské, of psychoses inferred from such a hallucinations processes.
Hallucinations or visions, if are being created to vykolejení balance neuronálních transmitérů brain - - mainly of dopamine, noradrenalinu, serotonin and acetylcholinu - - and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is rušena.
A comprehensive hallucinations, and the vicious ideas are found at very often schizophrenic psychózy.
Gravity over it has no power
The connection between delusions and the dream of staffed philosophers, and doctors since antiquity.
Aristoteles understood as a form of hallucinations dream in awake, wilhelm griesinger, one of the founding modern psychology, stated in 1861, "the great resemblance blouznění snovými" positions, for sigmunda freuda was a dream even "psychóza, all nonsense, delusions, the senses deceiving."
The fall of 2001, henning t. is changing in the komiksovou figure.
His body is dvojrozměrné a blatant color.
Gravity hanging over it has no power, with the ceiling room.
Feel nakopnutí.
For him okřídlené čertovské figures, with bloody the red grimasami, cenící teeth.
Pursuit, kopají him into a severe him, ohnivými shoes, throws them with him of the wall, feel pain throughout the body.
The votes, bad risks from walls and radio.
Can no longer tolerate votes, which nadávají him, and urážejí.
Henning t. pulls two kabely from sterea, zauzlí do warp and to consolidate it on the hák stropě.
Rise, on the one reproduktor and the system, can be around the neck of.
Have jumped.
Noose permits.
Pouč, shout at each other, sborově voices trhajíc bubínky him, "you on a clinic don 't treat!"
Today, it is henningu t. 40 years, has seen the last from 2 years, the first six acute of psychoses, almost 20 years ago.
Were opened lsd.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychóza, in addition, is maniodepresivní, take drugs against the depression, mania, schizophrenia.
Learned to live with their disease is a married, three years.
In psychosis i witnessed the worst fear, and deepest doubts, he says.
The ghosts of are hroznou reality
About 1% of people, least one for the lives of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics, this is the depresích the second most léčené disease.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis cannot disability most distinguished internal and external world, to přebuzeného the state, which can lead to halucinacím, velikostním, vztahovým the unreal, or the illusion of harassment.
Hearing voices - - the vote, which is a particularly widespread rozkazují, commentary or lead dialogues.
Even the optical hallucinations is not unusual.
Postižený is important to distinguish from nedůležitého, the brain cannot odfiltrovat disruptive signals, the knowledge is zaplaveno perceptions.
As well as the dream of opens the door psychóza the floodgates the flood of ideas and fantasy, that emanates from the class consciousness.
The perception of the reality is centered on the subject, says professor in psychosis thomas fuchs, psychiatry 's chief physician clinics general university clinics in heidelbergu.
Schizophrenic in the center stage, everything is the importance of směřovaný on it.
It takes to passive role, becomes a, přemožený events like the dream, and it cannot actively shape.
Therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulováni schizophrenia.
Compared to the reality is mostly possible with them, the ghosts of are hroznou reality, the awakening is ruled out.
One experience for life halucinaci
Otherwise, than in the dream, says fuchss, "but sensory remains a prostorová structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, fundamentally zachovaná."
Vicious ideas and hallucinations is based on the reality that is to alienation experience in the real framework.
Scientists still face a puzzle, why exactly our brains is doing takovéhle the twists.
For each person can lead to the exceptional, that they will lose their relationship to reality, says fuchs in the short run.
Not everyone will develop into psychózy but.
There is a genetic dispositions, it seems that to schizophrenia, but on dvojčatech studies have shown that genes are not the only the determining factor.
Scientists have come from the fact that the people have minimal brain damage.
Believe that in the early advanced stages of development, there will be to damage neuronálního growth of the brain, for example, virovým disease mothers during pregnancy, explains the fuchs.
But the puzzle, as it comes to disorder neuronálního system remains, which in the years, not showed no.
The effects of the rest of the - related stress also play a role, or traumatic experiences can be iniciátorem psychózy, if it is to it dispositions.
Also halucinogenní drugs can initiate psychosis, because to intervene in přenosového system.
When our brains zavaří
The lunatic is that psychotronici suffers from its halucinacemi, and to them to get rid of medication, polykají expensive, others, the money for drugs, that is, says professor psychology erich kasten from lübecku.
Whether delusions is regarded as a pleasant or bad news, is often a question of attitudes.
Kasten forage for ten years halucinacích and přeludech report, in the past year interpreted their results in his book the "die irreale welt in unserem kopf" (chimerical world in our heads).
While hallucinations belongs to a typical the accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as the border personality or depression also often diseases like migréna, epilepsie, roztroušená skleróza or alzheimer 's or mozková trauma.
Surprisingly, the halucinuje under certain conditions, and the common man himself.
Hallucinations, according to kastena, made up of obsahů ideas, which are normally suppressed.
Arise, when part of the brain, in which the sensory perception, are active or too little repressed; if our brains zavaří, or when the lack of stimulus.
Drugs can this state of turned as well as mozková damage or psychóza.
But also the removal of incentives, stress, with other exceptional love or other states.
In the more recent studies of the udala to one - third of the said that, at least one that in the life of experienced halucinaci.
In the summer of 2005 is sarah k. 16 years ago, live in a small town in meklenbursku - leading pomořansku and go on there gymnázium.
In fact, normal girl altogether.
If there were those obrazce and votes.
The classes, that it can become osloví kolohnát with long hair, tmavými.
When, say, look to it fellow with no surprise - - in addition to see it and hears of the boys.
But this tentative she consider stiff snílka, sarah k. nesní, knows it.
It is up, voices of the boys, just as and see, such as hearing sit and see a girl side by side in the classroom.
Even can feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
Is this pleasant a sense, has a boy, i 'd be happy to.
I fool?, asks, sometimes.
But knows that this boy, and other delusions are not real and, in turn, will disappear.
Zjevy are more depressing at night
Often are delusions burdens.
When sitting in class, can watch teaching, because many teacher in its eyes, and uších is a new spolužáka, with on all but explains the rest of the slyšitelně and has visibly at tabuli mathematical equation.
In the night of zjevy are more depressing.
When a in his tmavém room to sleep, which is rarely and too late, often cannot distinguish, whether it is up or whether sleep, whether the images, which they see, grimasy, or she with krvácejícími řeznými cuts in the hands of jejíma an open and nohách arise or zavřenýma our eyes.
Let me in a room, man on those figures.
Parents and friends nothing does not tell us, would have thought that zbláznila of it.
Fall 2009. sarah k. it is now 20 years.
Had the will do maturitu and live with their friend.
A year ago hallucinations stalled.
Since then, what on the internet kontaktovala psychologist kastena knows exactly, that nezbláznila.
Delusions are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or are derived from the stimulus, will have him with the likely hallucinations, says kasten.
The brain, i believe, then it does not enough employment and the old himself of his fun.
Sarah k. jedináček, should be a small holčička fear of other children, they often play itself.
Its hallucinations began to, when the in 13 knew that a man, which is táta since the days, when itself think, is not its own father.
Because the visual and akustických hallucinations are active those same brain areas that process, sensation - real, and sounds is for the as sarah k. difficult to discern from themselves bludy a reality. "every experience," says kasten, "was going on in the brain, the reality is there shows.
Hallucinations images, which are also be a brain, this is so real. "
Also the dreams assesses the kasten as a form of hallucinations.
Hallucinations neodlišuje fundamentally healthy people from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizofrenikům are psychologically the health of the people are able to identify its bludy as unrealistic.
Kasten advised because of their patients, to evaluate hallucinations as a unique capacity to.
The border state of between the dream of a hallucinations
In our world concentrated mostly patologizován, too, unfortunately, the knowledge is an imaginary experience is michael schmidt - degenhard, professor in heidelbergu and šéflékař psychiatric hospital and psychoterapeutické clinics florence nightingale in düsseldorfu.
Psychóza is difficult, útrpná disease, but it also provides the benefits of, creativity - mirage is also the art of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard studying the so - called oneiroidní form of experiences, special form of změněného knowledge to dream.
Oneiroidní conditions are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which offended is seen as the real, and have or back to discern from the state bdělého.
Oneiroidní caused by the state of knowledge, there is a in extreme situations trauma or disease, for example, patients polyradikulárním zánětem, who are experiencing in full awareness of motor paralyzed.
When one is threatened by the loss of the world, and itself, to be long, complete the failure of movement, replacing the situation their own, imaginárním life - threatening the real world, which is people from reality, the schmidt - degenhard.
The kind of border between the dream of a hallucinations.
Because in the reality is not possible mastery of some of the situation, it comes to change worlds, but the real situation zpřítomní do ideas.
Intense unbearable form of support for the senses and the transfer of the senses in a situation that allows us to the people to their ability to switch shaping, during the point to the loss of knowledge.
This is the real, and later in memory
Also historian art peter cornelius claussen described their oneiroidní experiences in his book a "soul" (the heart of the exchange herzwechsel) as a safety action.
He was 49 years, when the heart chlopně after operation with the subsequent the heart of the transplant published his sense of on několikadenní way, with his body leželo nehybně on a intense care.
Claussen to ponořil into the world, which has a jobs created, visited foreign: becoming upoutaným - malaria bed net, to the old man in the vlakovém sanatoriu, the robot hlídá his health.
Live in the early the middle ages between šlechtou, which produces narcotics of blood.
A motorcycle carry their country 's rivers do it, in the hospital lůžku surfuje on firnu in alpách and potká of the korean mafiána.
Plunge really do imaginary happening, all of this is the real, and later in memory.
These internal the way for claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
Sen, is different described their experience.
In contrast to dreams are memories of those mentálních way for years, and in nepodstatných details of clear - cut.
Even clearer and intense than real experience.
The momentum of this experience rozbíjí horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says the psychiatrist schmidt - - degenhard.
After all, psychózy show oneiroidní, hallucinations and drug opojení, how fragile are also in awake our internal images of external reality.
Any change of the state of the consciousness, summary of psychologist kasten, "can lead to distortions of this reality, what we say."
The fact that may also be enriching.
Sníh can come
Burda
Nakladatelství to take over in 27 have children
New leaders nakladatelství kallen is a temporary solution: the long - term hubert it wants to burda passed on to their business into the hands of their both children, he said, spiegelu.
Holding, and in the future belong to the 100 procentně family.
Hamburg - nakladatel hubert burda see their business in the hands of their children in the long term.
Both children will be a dědit in 27 years have a strong will enter into a firm, says the 69letý man spiegelu.
Details, we are to solve a carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is regarded as then.
And the question of whether to have the skills.
It is impossible to take the lead in their children, if they are not enough able to 7500 workers.
To by were killed as children, and business.
Burda in january - announced that the stahuje from the presidency of the board, and appointed as his successor, paul - bernharda kallena.
52 letý kallen since 1999, is a member of the u burdy.
First, was in charge of technology.
Later, with úsekem treasury by responsibility for the property of society, and for the resignation of jürgena todenhöfera also direct marketing, foreigners have, press, and finance.
For the first time is not at the forefront of the nakladatelství none of the family members.
Burdovým children is 19% and 17 years, his son felix, which now would be to 42, died from a few years ago.
The appointment of kallena also serves to "překlenuli 10 - 15 years," he said to burda.
Holding should i belong to the 100 procentně family, says burda in the future.
With regard to the schickedanz and schaeffler, the burda put it, that family - owned enterprises are not sure before the demise of the: "dotklo to always firms, which is to infect desire for capital, which can become speculated, and thought that the big players.
To my strategy has never been.
He has never had "dreams of a world power," says the burda.
Nevnímám as the country 's political preceptor, as was springer, and i don' t want to play the world 's league with "time", these trades are too big.
The promise to fonpeek
Peek is extremely limitovaný, only serves to prohlížení mail, without the possibility of prohlížet a type of příloh or chinese netizen after network.
Užil its five minutes glory in the us, when the time praised as one of the products of it.
Will it outside is more difficult, but the idea can be an interesting, mainly for young people.
Unlike the smartphonů peek characterized by a very low price and monthly platbami, less than half the amount of a datový plan iphone, for example, that is true.
After his success society began to offer two new equipment for twitter, the second: one is entitled solely on the basis of permanently provided by free data services, for which, however, is the need to pay for peek six - fold amount of money.
Fonpeek, which was presented in the action le web yesterday, is the european version of the invention, and also his third transformation.
It is limits on as well as his american counterpart, but the surprise.
Monthly cost for payments, cca €12 month, and includes roaming across europe.
People consumers are already know what it means to lose smartphonem data services for cross borders, or impatiently seek to kavárnu with wifi (or connections fon), they could resolved poštu.
Idea with roomingem for a firm price is an incredibly attractive, and it should be implemented long ago.
Yes, some operators have special treaty, and travel plans, but, according to my experience needed by one of physics, doctorate understood, and also very good spectacles to them, to read miniature písmenka.
The european commission constantly demands for lower tariffs roamingu, to be accessible for the whole of europe, which still does not have than the desired effect.
There is just the fear of the use of datových services outside the domovský state.
As a fonpeek (it is interesting to that such a machine, that i continue to name fon, when it does not wifi) to reach this kind of tarifu, means that are beginning to think differently, and considers different operators supply, kterýmiby kompenzovali its datovou network.
Kindle is another pěkným example of the, offers the withdrawal of books and other searches on the internet.
No treaty, no complications.
This is připojené facilities, and applies to buy, not after months.
And this is precisely what i expect that one is in případěfonpeek, it is about the possibility of a permanent approach as to buy with peek has already established in the us.
Not because that would have to wanted to buy.
I don 'prohlížím poštu on the telephone, i thank.
I expect to, as i believe, that is the best to from the point of view of consumers ten type of.
It would be interesting to use, if the same system has even in computers.
The color of, kterouzbožňuje michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite the color of the first ladies the us.
For the emergence of a us president barack obama 's to function took dress and turned coats in this of the color of, there samou color, was elected, when it was accompanied by in the second most important moment of its life: the handover in oslo nobel peace prize.
Michelle obama used in both cases, in addition, very similar models, that it is a similar clean - - žlutozelená with třpytivými effects - - in both cases, it was a třídílný komplet - dress, sáčko and turned coats from the same cloth - - ozdobený much výšivkou or límečkem.
At first glance, that the first lady seemed to the us decided to go in the footsteps of asturijské princess and wear similar clothes.
A substance, from which clothing zhotoveno, both models is doing is very different.
On the occasion of the returning to office, michelle used great krajku, in the oslo samet with potiskem.
Changing i supplements: the green shoes medium - high podpadkem, nynípodobný model, but in the golden of the color of.
Wear and different účesy: tentokrátdrdol, before rozpuštěné hair.
75% of workers mothers has labor problems associated with the mateřstvím.
Discrimination in employment has increased, especially in women in recent years younger ročníků, which willingness to buy a child.
This is the outcome of the study 'fertility, and labor spanish women' s career, by csic in cooperation with the institute of women.
Studies attended by 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years, and the results are an unambiguous: 75% of workers mothers motherhood have limited the possibility of labor - market of reason.
Studies pointed out, at the beginning of the partnerského co - existence is that many differences of views on the number of children, according to this, whether or not work, and also according to the kinds of employment.
Women, which do not work outside the home, in part - time work, or they lack a stable job, are beginning to live with partner sooner, sooner porodí first child, and overall have more children.
From the other side of the, above all, women with a stable job, in the public sector partnerships coexistence and motherhood postponing, and have less offspring.
"women from 35 to 49 let the stable job are the first child in the average 3.7 years since the beginning of the coexistence with partner. this number is 4.1 on its stable job in the case of women, kterédosažení more as a result, some of his life, and have had to postpone partnerships coexistence, and the arrival of children.
Type of occupations is also a powerful influence on motherhood, even when the smaller influence in the period of time, the launch of a "co - existence with partner, explains the margarita delgado, which is dedicated to research in the csic.
Another factor influencing the age of women in a time of a anarození child marriage is degree of education.
From research suggests that the higher the degree of education, the higher the i age, when women are vdávají, and have their first child.
The differences between women are also the same generation.
In to 49 35 years of age group women, for example, the basic and higher education porodily its first child in the age of 25,1 popř. 32,1.
"there is a further the difference between women in depending on their level of education.
The fundamental educated women vdávají and porodí even before the first child will find a stable job, while the middle or high - educated women 's in reverse, prefer a stable job, and a child' s birth of the first "before issuing marriage, reports delgado.
