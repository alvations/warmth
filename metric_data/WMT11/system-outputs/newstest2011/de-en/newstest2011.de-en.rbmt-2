What it should do, that? The Czech social democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, yet the "Konditorei."
The new aldermen of the capital out of the rows of that will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers in order to be able to understand its old new colleagues out of the ODS in the citizen of Prague advice and in the city representation generally.
The newspaper has "raped" members of the new advice out of that once a few how they control the notorious slang, that became established in the last years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague were at the oar.
The codified vocabulary, that was introduced in the past era by mayor Pavel Bém of the citizen of Prague of political elite, is some of the best known participants, situations and Causae borrows.
Surprisingly appeared that the new Räte grope these new concepts with regard to that something in the dark.
They maintain that at least.
"Who is Voldemort"?
"No idea."
"I am sooner a novice in the citizen of Prague politics," reacted Luká Kaucký, the new alderman for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But also the alderman Karel - a political veteran - reacted in similar manner.
For example on the concept "gulf hole."
"That is the single expression of which that you produce me here, that I there and again would use."
"Otherwise I do not hold much of slang."
Out of the vocabulary, that the daily paper in this year's June had published before the choice congress of the ODS, pickte the editorship six concepts out, above all such, that are connected notorious with the citizen of Prague magistrate.
The social democrats should define the concepts "Voldemort," "largest citizen of Prague gulf hole," "into the Konditorei go," "bull nape," "treason of the capital" and "verblechen."
Three citizens of Prague alderman agreed the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future boss of the citizen of Prague of school system - promised participate to be sure first his in the conversation, took then however not even the listener off.
The fifth alderman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start.
"These things are equal and like itself the middle class democrats among one another maintained me, judge about that I not."
"For me is important, like we us in the frame of our programs understand," countered it.
How already indicated, Luká Kaucký in the headline mentioned above not nominally would have recognized that by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, novel is Janoušek the speech.
The concept "Voldemort" says Kaucky purely nothing at all and the single concept, that it correctly guessed in the test, "the largest citizen of Prague was gulf hole."
"That is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, joined to the security however yet thereto: I know "but that sooner out of the newspaper."
And joking: "I will have to cover" probably a language course.
The "gulf hole" will separate decoded then not only of matador Karel also of the alderman for environment questions Luká Plachý correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
Both social democrats know however also, for whom the term Voldemort stands and even suspects Luká Plachý, where this figure is to be found and through it also, what is named it, "into the Konditorei to go."
"I believe, that is, into any citizen of Prague gastronomy business to go," is Plachý rather nearly at it at the riddle solution if one knows, that it concerns herewith the seat of Janoušeks firms.
Concurring with it assures however to have taken these knowledge sooner out of the newspaper, than that this vocabulary would be own of it.
To judge the test participants after, it seems to give no similarly naturalized slang under the social democrat actually.
"I asked also my colleagues, but there obviously is not so something here really."
"We would call us in the name, there and again use we also shorthand symbol or nickname," says the chairperson of the citizens of Prague Petr Hulínský - of its party comrades careless "Hulda" named.
"In the school became I (birch) named, but I knows not, whether me also my colleagues so name," betrays us Karel its nickname.
The newspaper Deník tried the name and see there - it functions.
Alderman Weinert the "grandpa" or fewer is would thump for the party comrades friendlily friendlily the "old," the representative Miroslav, is named, that made before the choices through wheelings and dealings in the party sponsorship aware of itself, of many colleagues (well known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are so the only that the social democrats in the innerparteilichen usage allow.
Hulínský does not like it nominally if one names it "Hulda," but Deník registered another other nickname of the citizen of Prague of chairperson.
Its nickname "doctor of the nightsticks rights" nominally therewith has to do that Petr Hulínský acquired its title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witch" and gave a pamphlet out
Women, who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witch, show as a rule some joint social features.
They belong to find sooner the older generation, it no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women to the witch "becomes," she exertally is isolated so that she cannot become the remainder of the village dangerous.
"Men quite rarely are concerned" of this fate.
"Also young and healthy women remains this saved, because it at work help and children bear," describes a nun the situation, that attends in the capital of the west African country Burkina Faso in a special home to more than one hundred women, who were ejected by its partnerships.
The place government decided now to advance against this measure" abnormal "social.
A pamphlet and published for this reason, that should stop the "witch pursuit."
The thing has however a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adult in Burkina Faso cannot read," showed the newspaper "derStandard" on the dilemma of the written clarification there.
To be accused the witchcraft is perfectly acceptable however also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, was tortured the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men too deaths - it poured over it with petroleum and ignited it simply on.
Over this occurrence, among other things also the server BBC reported.
The culprits maintained to be sure, the thing would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version oil would be inflames, that would be used to ritual ointments.
And to be sure, after the group had tried, "to expel" "an evil spirit" out of the woman.
The people support the isolation of "witch" here without consideration on its development.
"The standard" quoted to this a 42-year-old entrepreneur out of Burkina Faso: "Gluttons of human souls are earlier like today a danger," said it.
While the government in Burkina Faso strives at least therefore, to defuse the witch hunt, the gambianische president in the past year even orderly mixed with the president.
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh kindled after death of its aunt a monstrous witch hunt because these had nominally share in its death and now try would become, also to kill" the president himself through black magic.
"In addition called it shaman out of the near Guinea to aid, the women indiscriminately arrested in accompaniment by policemen, soldier and the bodyguard the president and men violent out of gambianischen villages of abducted and on the farm of the president in Kanilai brought," led the organization Amnesty International in its report on.
On the farm, the eingekerkerten people were forced to drink an Absud out of plants with halluzinogener effect, that however also intestine problems and kidney problems evoked.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
First based on the international pressure, the almost thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: It heats to be sure in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An older placed under man leaves just the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "of coal baron" Bakala, the largest private owner of rent dwellings in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three dwellings: for the own and of the dwellings its daughters and its son, the verbüßt just one prison sentence.
All three became in the frame of that so-called. "Deregulation" just the rent increases.
Instead of of 3500 crowns month rent the son in the next year should shell out for a 2-Zimmer-Wohnung 2-Zimmer-Wohnung room 2-Zimmer-Wohnung dwelling with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there gives it in the dwelling not even fluently warm water and heat must one in a simple coal oven," types annoys he with the finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signature he has an authority.
"But what - signed have I," declared it half upsets and half resigns.
The citizen union BytyOKD. cz, that designated the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral," to sign advises the tenants, the new contracts simply not and to wait to the 7th of December, at which they thought to publish some instructions, how one advances against such contracts.
But the man declines only.
"One says this, that other that," makes it a dark face.
The region Ostrava becomes laboratory" so the large "deregulation.
After New Year this deregulation will be forthcoming most rent dwellings in the Czech Republic, whose tenants pay previously no market-driven rent.
Concluded therefore to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday breaking full.
Immediately next to the door, the Bodyguards of a security agency and with it a proclamation device stand.
"Would rent 2011," illuminates a special key field on the Touchscreen.
Shortly touched and already spits the device a number slip of paper from.
Hardly we decoded and already chirps the number "157" it on the large display at the cover of the waiting room.
A half second one is later at the row.
Somewhat later an older married couple enters the waiting room in order to ask about the rent, but the onset in the waiting room counts evidently not at all the new rent.
Most people are here, to solve around the usual problems - repair proposals, insurance matters and similar.
From in the middle of November, the envelopes with the new leases flutter in the region Ostrava most tenants of the altogether 44,000 dwellings of the portfolio the RPG into the mailboxs.
The RPG Byty strikes them in the letter a rent increase of ca. 15 to 38 percent before.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center is opened for the 18th of November.
"The action runs somewhat over a week, that is, that is first the beginning," answer the ladies behind the switch after a moment hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miner dwellings are a disruptive subject.
Before the choices, the parliament vice president coming out of Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek by that had taken up this subject rather lauthals, no wonder that the newspapers are full therefrom today.
I want "twenty years of them a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. They were able to exchange WC glasses," makes itself the from the outset mentioned man air.
Until now stand the colleagues according to above all pensioner at the switch in order to convince itself whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, that promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer on time.
Into the enjoyment of a February rent reduced to the half, also the other tenants should come, who sign the new lease to the 15th of December.
Until now, "deregulation is anything but switch" in however, overburdened of demands.
"Of the yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of here," appreciate the switch officials.
RPG offers at the same time both on its web pages and blackboards necessarily appears individual rent agreements, where it.
If the rent parties should not agree however on the new rent, it would be determined of an independent court.
"That should no threat be, but rather is as an information about the only possible and totally legitimate legal procedure to understand," explains RPG on its web pages.
"Here goes no one before court," means gives one of the colleagues of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client center its at least partially quite.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, therefrom remain me 5,000 for the meal over, where should I the money for a court dispute take here," means it.
Then becomes the employees yet unsteady.
See" "time.
"Mr. Zaorálek says them over the media, it should not sign and so wait the people yet from," gives it to consider.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty is the rent increase an economical necessity.
"The existing height of the rents passes not even to the maintenance of the accustomed fund out of," argues Pavel climatesš, the director of the dwelling portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - straight the neglect criticized by the raised tenants of the dwelling fund is in the opinion of the home owner the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 was able to invest out of the taken in rents four billions into the dwellings, in the four years of 2011to 2014,5.2 billions should be it.
On the großformatigen LCD display at the cover vis-à-vis the easy chair in the waiting room of emerge in between again and again a couple of information red illuminating.
"The rent increases in 2011 around 15% and fewer concern 31,200 dwellings, that is more than 90% of the dwellings of RPG."
"Always means this at most 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 dwellings out of the portfolio of RPG, the rent raises itself by 38 percent.
"In these cases concerns it the increase of extremely slight rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
In 2600 dwellings, the rent in the next year remains on same height.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents jerky into the height, but rather results gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the business a further obligation imposes itself: The business wants to stick all revenue out of the rent increase (see chart) again into the dwellings, above all in warmth savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - in priority these should benefit that people, who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - to the office belongs also a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the business Arch. design.
But who would expect here already a mini kindergarten, with everything what belongs in addition: colorful walls, creative furniture, a quantity toy and even a mini playground on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten has been available for past year the colleagues of Arch. design.
The planning office and architecture office Arch. design, out of whose studio an entire row of notable Brünner come constructed, reckoned of the first designs for the new building Avriopoint at with the accomodations for its firms mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, for that of its 90 colleagues (interior) are is lain in the Babyboom age and the firm that the Projektantinnen and architects return as quickly as possible at its job.
Together with the possibility to work shortened, is the kindergarten a further bonus that Arch. design has to offer to its employed in the draft of its social program.
The building engineers and -architects have it so more easily to bring its demanding occupation and the child care under a hat.
The mini kindergarten is succeeded to win an original idea of the colleagues (interior) of Arch. design and with the support of the management it them promote moneys of the European Union and the ministry for work and social for its project.
The operational mini kindergarten is financed through the operation program humane resources and employment politics out of means of the European social fund and out of the country budget of the Czech republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies in the amount of 2, 8 millions of CZK), the necessary arrangements and the equipment could be procured and is provided for the duration of 2 years for qualified personnel and for the business.
After the from creation of the subsidies (2 years), the company is obligated Arch. design to operate the mini kindergarten 3 further years on own costs further.
The preparation of this project used an entire year whereby the company Economy Rating performed energetic aid in the proposal settlement.
Around the children, entire active qualified personnel is concerned - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without altersmäßige restrictions although that of them are old over three years.
And there it herewith around a mini kindergarten goes, may be change itself simultaneously only 5 children present, to be sure the day over several children mutually off.
The kindergarten business is voted flexibly on the requirement of the parents, be right that children of all colleagues with regard to the utilization of the kindergarten the same - without consideration on the firm hierarchy and its respective position.
Although it concern individual upbringing and care, the program contents in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable with the frame program of the before education.
The children play here not only, above all becomes excellent instruction them offered - from basic insights to there to the before school instruction, incidentally learn it also yet English.
The class room is equipped not only with toy and creative games, but rather also with a computer, that is available the children.
What by carries more - the presence of small children in the firm to a friendly and positive firm milieu.
The parents can throw always a view of the children and so the stress falls in the belated picking up of the children out of one far removed kindergarten.
The parents use therefore its working hours more productively.
No wonder that here also natural and loyal employer-employee-relations develop.
Arch. design joined so under the Czech firms, that offer in the recruitment of new colleagues Benefits clear, that are family friendly and strengthen through such programs its personnel marketing.
A bone house fascinates also yet after 100 years. Look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof requests at like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairway such as the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths.
That is the Casa Batlló of the catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile gravel and mosaic, the facade remembering at barn and omnipresent soft lines, all this typical features are for art nouveau by Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures, that remind one of nature and living thing.
First in more exact looking, one notes that all is controlled by geometry, rhythm and thought out order.
In the night, the entire facade causes yet plastic, more dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the brightness of the colors yet.
The same spirited lines and verschlungenen forms control also that in the house.
Wood -like formed wavescopies the window frames, railing, ornament elements by doors, even look holes and strips.
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample at the animated purchase street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was caused by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, that architects Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction used two years and was locked 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, insisted originally on the abstract of the old and the building of a building new totally, but in the end it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheap reconstruction to.
The rent house Casa Batlló sketched Antoni Gaudí however not alone.
It collaborated at the same time with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on its tear board, the decoration for the representative dwelling of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics emerged was at the facade its idea.
At the formation of the facade, also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated however.
The joint work at the designs for the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful collaboration of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol was involved also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are.
Already shortly after its completion, the house got of because of the local inhabitants of its organic forms the nickname "bone house."
Other again named it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house."
One says would be represented also, very above on the building the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Katalonien.
But also further sculptural elements symbolize concealed religious subjects.
Gaudí sketched a headquarters heating system unique for the at that time time with ventilation canals and typical fireplaces for the house.
Somewhat bizarre seems its 45-Grad-Neigung 45-Grad-Neigung degrees of 45-Grad-Neigung inclination already.
Gaudí ignored in its creating consistently all at that time building directions and let itself shake in no way by this.
Before building start, it overtook were to be sure of the city the corresponding building permit however the details made by it about the planned reconstruction so vaguely that the city fathers were two years later in the completion so appalled of the result, that they demanded remedy.
The aldermen knocked themselves among other things also that the building with its pillars interfered even in the public sidewalk.
To changes, it came to be sure no longer, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of relating to this the quarter placed Josep Batlló a proposal to the permission of the rental both highly lain floors of the house - and it became it promptly given.
The home owner herself took in into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor a company drawing-room was found, on the third floor itself the bedrooms and private room of the dwelling.
The ground floor was leased at a jeweler business.
The entire sechsstöckige building passes through a stairway until up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and were replaced by bent and swung walls.
Gaudí worked however also with a modern draft to the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be connected through the opening of the drawing-room doors totally and so a larger company comfortably was able to chat without having to forgo in more confidential conversations a certain intimacy.
The house received also a quite unusual roof and two further floors through Gaudís reconstruction except a new facade.
Also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles is impressive with which the patio is disguised and the light yards.
The game both colors lends all floors of the house a maximum at light.
At the same time it made simply the principle to utilize itself that white the light better reflects, than dark colors, that absorb the sunlight to the contrary in addition.
The house Casa Batlló, that was included 2005 in the world heir list of the Unesco, anybody can visit today.
On the first floor the roomiest and grandest dwelling of the public accessibly is made.
The home owners decided not until the year to this step and this out of occasion the 150. birthday of the famous creator.
When one assessed, that this is a quite profitable business, one retained widened the examination, yes one it also on further joint and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace from.
The price to the examination of the building monument is to be sure no peanuts, it amounts to get 16.50 Euro, students, pensioner, groups and proprietor of tourist expulsion 20 percent reduction.
This sum exceeds Gaudí constructed the prices of admission to other in the city.
He, who would like to know learn the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, should try to close friendship with one of the house inhabitants and it at home visit.
The correct mattress and the bed rust correct? Women have other wishes as men
Not the craziest bed frame, but rather the quality of the couch area - therefore mattress and rust settle the good bed.
These harmoniously must supplement itself to be sure in order to become the wishing of the concrete user just.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not finally also the sex of the sleeper.
Also the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves, is just as important.
Typical example?
In a chateau, in which regularly heated becomes not, latex mattresses are not suited well because they more long need much in order to become" "warm.
In addition they are clearly heavier than an usual polyurethane mattress.
And - it regularly should be turned.
If they have namely not enough ventilation tubule in the kernel and lie yet in addition on a firm disk, staut itself moisture on: It is not excluded therefore that under its mold forms.
In the choice, naturally also a roll plays at which one is accustomed.
He who longer time was abroad where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual, will be able to become accustomed heavily to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Probably all ice hockey players who returned out of the NHL burdened themselves with me that they can" correctly sleep here no longer.
"For its worked very hard shoulders, heel and hips need it simply a soft layer out of Visco foam (memory Foam - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)."
Recommend I "this among other things also diabetic person, who suffer from an interference of the nervous system, so that it the" information" out of the joints and the skin badly receive can," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes in cushion furniture.
Therefore I provided already years ago many ice hockey players, but also other customer this mattress with Visco foam (memory Foam).
"Today this is no more problem, for such mattress the manufacturers offer among other things Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico at."
And one doesn't have to be unconditional a famous ice hockey player in order to learn appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" functions actually very simply.
The foam optimalisiert its hardness and corresponding to form that absorbed said warmth, differently, it schmiegt itself regular at the warm body on.
Nowhere it does not press rolls itself, in which night one around like after a heavy battle.
One sleeps simply much better.
The viskoelastische foam offers in addition also protection from Dekubitus (wound fire).
In the choice of the mattress size, one should add to the height still the length of the sole, therefore ca. 21 to 34 cm.
Man such as woman, who are large at the 180 cm, need such a 210 bed long until 220 cm.
At least 90 cm of couch width should be available everyone the sleepers, together therefore 180 cm.
In single beds, for example with singles, are mounted 120 to 140 cm.
Because of the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If one on the back lies, should yet enough place for the easy angewinkelten arms be," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and room outfitter, that already for years the problematic nature of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture dedicates itself and lectures this subject also on vocational schools.
In a double bed needs pay attention are also high every one own rust and its own mattress, but in the purchase, therewith the mattress.
Otherwise does nothing remain other when the rust to mount in different height and that is by far possible in every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, should fall mattress with feather skeleton 15 cm, therefrom at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine cushion.
"By hand or in the sitting may one the cushioning under no circumstances sense," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress makes a special rust type required.
Entire cushions beds with mattress and document such as grown together Siamzwillinge have nothing to seek in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and cannot wash the reference one, what is today already perfectly acceptable.
And there one in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear that the mattress becomes after five to seven years slowly a gigantic (and clogged sieve).
Also therefore specialists reject advertising slogans, that promise a service life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee in mattress.
Each thing has its if and however.
And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm widths one should not shun the hygiene of the washable, deductible references, nevertheless it recommends itself to use a mattress cover, that one easily can draw-off and wash.
Also if today as a rule mattress references with all around zipper are produced, so that one gets two halves after the opening (immensely important to the wash process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone carried out, requests often like the unequal battle between David and Goliath on.
Do they have a firm disk in bed instead of a rust?
Out therewith!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also so they should equip the disk rather with ventilation holes (as far as already no inside are) and mattress with feather skeleton and 15 cm least height with so-called. Use pocket feather kernel and fine cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such one document.
For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 feather strips (Lamellen), latex mattress or sandwich mattresses are suited (where appropriate also combinations of latex and Kokos), always pay itself at the same time rust with a larger slat amount, therefore by 28 and more feather strips from to regulate with Lordosenstütze in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility, the slat hardness.
On adjustable Lamellenroste, no mattresses with feather skeleton belong because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Next to the attitude the stiff of the feather strips also special flexible shoulder modules are offered.
Herewith it concerns a special reinforcement of the feather strips, that enables it to imprint the feather strips or quite so to verwinkeln that they enable that at particular points sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Nominally for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There is even mattress manufacturer who began to use mattress" soft zones with "gentleman for the shoulder area.
Also at the ladies is thought - them grants one these soft zones in the Hüftgegend.
For most demanding customers, point elastic wing feather systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact Pads are with so-called. Multitorsionsfederung determines.
The pressure is distributed among several points by what means the tension diminishes itself.
But - if one uses a bad (too large and portly) pillow to the correct mattress and correct rust, most advantages get lost again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, should pass its tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally a 50 x appears therefore 60 cm of large pillow how it for example the scandinavian like.
In the side situation, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have have something with the former (with hay of filled) straw sacks yet meanly.
Modern manufacturers use always more frequently natural materials or at least its additions.
Also in mattress, the new magic word is named "organic."
Instead of petroleum raw materials, one uses to the manufacture of polyurethane foams of always frequent naturelle oils - for example castor bean oil and soya bean oil.
Soya bean is used probably of all well known manufacturers.
"Organic is named in mattress, the origin purely natural its kernel out of materials exists," explains Petr by the firm Tropico plus.
Nature materials are used however also in the manufacture of mattress references - one of the first was there Aloe Vera.
One can grant himself however also Mikrokapseln, that spread fresh forest aroma or lavender aroma in the sleep.
Also here one makes a difference between man and woman.
While at the men a "cooling" plant extract is used out of birch leaf, so that the mattress reference can absorb the warmth and can cool off the body, have the references for women "warming" effect.
Extract out of red peppers of lively the blood circulation on, that weaker sex becomes in the sleep therefore comfortable warm.
And the current favorites?
Mattress out of cold foam (it has larger pore with destroyed cell structure and is therefore respiration more active than a standard practice polyurethane and also much more flexibly).
Through the combination the different stiff (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams more emerge-zones-mattress that exactly know, where head, hip and heel are.
For a high-value mattress, one has to shell out to be sure 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses are burdened however usually with slighter value-added tax because they count than medical remedies.
First Czech business became Gumotex this advantage given.
One does not see is, to save at the mattress and at the rust so easy.
There and again there is special offer of manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
So the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze offers with in the reference verstepptem Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
One gets the second free in addition.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of the viskoelastischen foam materials with open cell structure and higher density in almost cosmic speed.
No wonder, were developed it yet for the NASA, for the astronauts are stopped in the starts enormous overburdenings.
Tempur is hardened itself in warmth soft, in cool milieu it again.
So it adapts itself the human body perfectly and distributes in optimal manner the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to the prevention of pressure fire, but rather increases generally the sleep comfort.
Viskoelastische foam materials become however not only in mattress, but rather also in other health products how for example in special foot cushions uses, that should provide the legs and the containers relief.
Domestic manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people supervision devices in order to have the kids under control
The anxiety around the own children are awake and so more and more parents consider to supervise it per GPS.
The system, that was invented originally to the search after cars, can locate namely just as well people, what would be helpful also in such cases, like recently in that without a trace disappearance of the nine year old Janatková.
The device is not would be allowed to be larger presently about as large as a cigarette box however already soon it, than a watch.
The case of the disappeared in anxiety and frights transferred many people and so they keep a lookout for way and means to protect its children better.
Also for the price of an impairment of its privacy.
"We strive us, all to say, that it herewith in no case around Herumspionieren concerns, but rather an effective means, the probability to diminish, that it to the tragedy comes," leads Petr Pilin of the company Macro because on, one of the suppliers of GPS orientation devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come in the individual case to the abuse of such devices, for example if one sticks it someone into the pocket, without that it knows therefrom, but we had previously no such case to indicate."
"Most customers buy itself it really for safety reasons," joins Pilin thereto.
According to its opinion the child however always should know, which purpose the "box" serves and uses it like one in the emergency.
The child psychologist Dana refers however on that that a child does not like to carry, if it such a thing, it its simply gets rid of.
"Also very small children show large creativity if it goes therefore to lose certain things intentionally if they do not want" become controlled.
"Already the mobile phones woke originally at the parents large expectations, but it let itself just as easily disengage, like these new supervision devices," means woman.
According to your opinion is also disputed whether such one arrangement actually helps in the case an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper controlled practically always whether the child has any electronics with itself, with that it located become could."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such supervision devices were used wider, they would seek this also because its sale would be certain" of massive advertising accompanied.
"In these cases are the criminals of the police always a step ahead," means the psychologist.
It clears however that similar devices can be thoroughly helpful in a sudden attack through a pedophile.
Roberta of the company according to RC Monitoring, the orientation services both for automobiles and for people offers, can help the existence of such a device also then if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted namely so that it reports" the respective position in certain intervals.
"Also if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the concerned person is available."
"In more expensive devices is even an inclinometer integrates, that is, if one falls down and motionless lie remains, sends the device immediately a warning under statement of the position," maintains gentleman.
According to its opinion similar services could perform mobile phones also intelligent with navigation, needs one to balance out only a special software.
The problem of the present orientation devices exists therein that it concerns herewith either devices in match box size, that resemble followers or around smaller mobile phones.
Always so the danger exists that one loses it.
Mr. Pilin of the Macro because according to one tests therefore in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"That has the advantage that the possible aggressor doesn't have to recognize at all, that it concerns a supervision device and/or orientation device.
"Or it notices that first after certain time, what the police a time advantage gives," joins it thereto.
Equal, in which direction the development goes - there to bracelets or followers, always is used at the same time the same technology, like in the vehicle orientation.
Therefore around the combination out of orientation function with the help of the GPS system (just as in the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, that reports the current position.
The army has wrap up could hold so many ignition cords, that one entirely the Czech Republic you however only two years
The Czech army shopped become 445 kilometers of ignition cords, ignited become with explosive charges.
In the previous year the defense ministry had delivered already 224 kilometers of ignition cord at the army warehouses.
It is to be known already calming that the military forces provided from for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, at most however four years.
The army bought the ignition cords of the corporation STV Group, a. s. for läppische 40 million crowns.
In its establishment for the purchase of this powerful quantity ignition cord the general staff MF DNES, the soldiers answered would consume annually ignition cord at the 60 kilometers.
The investigations of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, the MF DNES on that addressed, goes out of this statement forth that the entire army would have to graduate annually an extremely intensive pyrotechnische education - of all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and cleaner.
Ministers of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only so the notable annual consumption of sixty kilometers ignition string could be justified half-way.
This length corresponds by the way 25,000 detonations.
But also so these army supply would pass for more than ten years.
If however yet the old rule counts of experts, that to the training of each new occupation soldier two meters of ignition cord suffice totally, the army created itself through these new purchases - also under the viewpoint of the increased requirement of the pioneer units and special units - a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years.
At the same time soldiers of the fast use brigade burdened himself recently at the Minister of Defense Vondra, they would have almost no patrons for hand firearms more so that shoot practices are restricted because of the missing means strongly.
Of the underpants deficiency very to are quiet.
Goes in "me also not why they buy" such enormous quantities of ignition cords of us.
But that is in the end its decision, they already will know, need to which it it."
"For us is the army a good customer, that we as a dealer most extensive contrary to come would want," says the sales and marketing manager of the STV Group Jan.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the defense ministry establishes the purchase Hunderter kilometer of ignition cord therewith, the army would have stocked up so at least for ten years with this "ammunition."
Jan of the STV Group speaks however only about a four-year-old use duration of the ignition cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker quite only of two years.
"In perfect storage are well also the four mentioned years possible," clears one of them, that however anonymous remain wants in order to not to be accused as a soldier the criticism of the army.
At the end of the use duration, each ammunition thoroughly must be tested whether it yet dependably is and does not endanger life of the soldiers.
These tests are however not for nothing, but rather cost further money.
A further argument of the defense ministry is the bulk discount for the 445 kilometers ignition cord.
"You cost us sixty percent fewer, than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," divides us speaker Pejšek the standpoint of the buyer of the defense ministry with.
Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of ignition string of Pyrotechnikern of the police, that ammunitions liquidate out of the second world war or the Soviet brother army, exceeds already some years long hardly 1,500 meters.
And the police orders always only such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before flow of the use duration.
Already the security because of the Pyrotechniker, moreover one holds himself so the possibility to flexible purchases more modern and therefore also more dependably ignition cords openly.
The defense ministry has anyway gigantic problems in the liquidation ten cable transmitter tons of ammunition out of times of the Resident of Warsaw of contract when the two hundred thousand headed Czechoslovakian people army prepared itself for its expedition to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, the MF DNES addressed, expected the Czech military forces into a couple of years of ignition cords older the same problem in the liquidation Hunderter kilometer, that has so "favorably" shopped it today.
Until today come lain me the contacts, that I won thanks to the competition
Entrepreneur "small the triumphant positioning in the competition the year" Luká Pytloun helped in the sale of the franchise of its hotel.
Entrepreneur "small winner the past year the competition the year" Luká Pytloun became out of Liberec.
The story of its success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun traveled gladly.
First abroad became it aware that it is missing in Liberec at good overnight stay possibilities to sensible praising.
Out of the savings of its vacation works abroad and with the help of a bank credit it arose a dilapidated house with five dwellings.
If one considers that it was at that time university student in the sixth semester, this was certain a courageous venture.
"The at that time price-quality-ratio annoyed me and so tried I, somewhat on the other hand to undertake," says Luká Pytloun.
It rented the first reconstructed dwelling at foreign worker.
The entire profit invested it immediately again into the house, that it rebuilt subsequently step for step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then it succeeded it in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions to open two style just restaurants and two hotels with an entire capacity of more than 300 beds of all lodging categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four star hotel "Pytloun design hotel."
This year a further first-class hotel arrived.
"Just have we a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé signed, that we our franchise draft sells have and further interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have itself already reported," says the entrepreneur number one of the past year.
Just the victory in the competition" had "large share in this license sale for operating of hotels entrepreneur of the year," joins Mr. Pytloun acknowledging thereto.
The victory brought in it larger familiarity, yes popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people of recognized me on the street, often congratulated it me even retroactively and I must say, that did really well," remembers he.
I recommend really all that want to create something to participate in this competition.
One needs to win also not equally, each Sichtbarmachung is good.
It says that it pulls until today out of the contacts and acquaintance utility, to which it would not have come otherwise at all.
"With some people, whom I encountered thanks to the competition, I maintain until business relations" regular today.
The renown connected with the success finds expression according to its opinion also a few on every its colleagues.
And there it has at the seventy.
"I note with them larger loyalty and pride on that that they are part of somewhat, the general recognition given becomes."
I look at this also really not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of us of all."
"My name is only something into the foreground moved," means Luká Pytloun of modest.
I wish my successors a quieter year, had it than we in Farmet
The victory euphoria was removed quickly of the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone firm of the year in the past year Karel of the firm proprietors of Farmet took toward.
The jury lauded at that time the exertions, with which it tramped out of the small tool building in Skalice a business out of the ground, that makes hundreds of millions of revenues.
"I can say, that this assessment not only me even, but rather also all my colleagues encourages and our self-confidence in the battle with the competition strengthened has," says the preceding year winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort stood to do something useful.
And as then the country as a compensation for that of the communists, property seized offered a small workshop to the lease to its father Karel, hesitated rush he not long, let its career in the firm, in which he was busied until there, and established with a couple of comrade of its father an own firm to the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Short time they later began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they climbed to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in entirely central Europe.
But first through the success in the mentioned competition and its Medialisierung, it did not enter also into the consciousness of the specialty public.
"Not only, that our customers the brand Farmet now clearly more intensive perceive, also our foreign partners began the circumstance, with a firm collaborate to can, that in its country the utmost success obtained has, larger value to ascribe," says Karel.
The past year stood in Farmet to be sure not only in the sign of the victory euphoria.
The assessment came from the economic results of the business in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And straight 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, that at that time yet fewer shook the citizens, but rather above all business, reached just its highpoint - many firms were forced to adjust its investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new arrangements and technologies.
We not naturally also were able to escape" "this situation.
"The revenues concerned 40 percent back, we must the production restrict and even to releases grasp," explains Karel
A viable business must seize sometimes also such unpopular measures.
It succeeded however to get the situation into the handle and to hold the firm in the black numbers, also if with slighter profits, than before the crisis.
With one, the business was not willing to make cuts - in the investments into the research and development.
"Out of the subsidy constructed we a researches and training center, we strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired head prices in native displays," says.
Everything witnesses therefrom that we overcame the crisis.
The revenues grow again and with them also the amount of new colleagues.
"The new victor wish I much joy in the victory - however in quieter atmosphere," lets align Karel.
An opinion poll that cleans up with absurd directions
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneur competition.
It succeeded many absurd directions already to create out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" the duty advanced to create documents on authorities, that are available Online.
So decided more than one-third of not entirely four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social insurance administration demanded a paper statement out of the trade index, also if it the officials can had retrieve through two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this changes now.
"The Czech social insurance administration becomes in the future in inspections of social insurance payers no statements out of the trade index more demand," led the speaker of Jana on.
It is the sense and purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" to take all directions and arrangements under the magnifying glass, that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfill and the absurd to cancel.
This is this year already for the fourth time part of an entrepreneur competition, that of the tsch. Financial newspaper (HN) arranged becomes and is pleased in the public of growing popularity.
If in the past year at the three thousand people at the voting tade part, were it this year already four thousand.
No wonder, for there still is a quantity of legal duties that serve only and alone in addition to hinder the business activity.
"What for example the amount of the income tax forms concerns, take we a front rank in the world a," notes Karel of the union smaller and mittelständiger business and tradesman of the Czech republic.
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity is in the last years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
In comparison with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic did hardly improve itself to be sure.
According to statements of the world Bank, the Czech Republic takes in the 74th rank with regard to the business conditions, in comparison with the preceding year a positioning worse around eight places.
The competition absurdity of the year was exclaimed for the first time in the year and plays itself each year after same scenario off.
Anybody can report nonsense administrative and bureaucratic the end of September from April to the editorship end of the competitions.
To the registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz serves. After that the organizer of the competition seven candidates chooses for the "Antipreis" and lets vote the public over the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
That absurdity that gets most voices wins.
To this year's opinion poll were said registered already more than hundred, more exact 105 senseless directions and arrangements.
The tips come not only of entrepreneurs, but rather also of occupation associations and journalists.
Under the nominated "finalist" of the competition, so for example also determinations are that maintenance vehicles has to pay for freeways and expressway Maut or that entrepreneur with twenty colleagues, two offices and two toilets must prepare every two years.
The index of the this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The declaration of the competition respectively beginning of November on the citizen of Prague Wenzelsplatz part of a happening, at which regularly also personalities of the political and public life participate, is.
This year smaller or mittelständiger business and tradesman of the Tsch were for example Eve Svobodová, the director of the association. Republic as well as Petr the president of the chamber of the Tsch. Republic in the highpoint of the competition with of the party.
"Where the country the entrepreneurs club between the legs throws, can it no real economic upswing give, therefore is it my goal, each year at least thirty paragraphs to cancel, that today the entrepreneurs yet unnecessarily its enterprises impede," divided Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade with.
The efforts to create absurd arrangements out of the world, show effect.
In 2007, duty imposed most the entrepreneurs disturbed the people to have to report the business office at the place of its permanent business site three days in advance the intention, to want to go with a display state to a display or Kirmes.
This duty was canceled on the basis of a novel of the business law.
The duty, that 2007 the second largest amount of the voices received became - the duty, the employment office business trip of employed in the circumference up to 30 days report to must - through the law over it so-called. "Green card" abolished.
And - three are all good things:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the ordinance was selected, that it imposed physiotherapists, in the consulting room a mirror to have stand a refrigerator and two person scales.
This ordinance was softened of the health ministry this year somewhat - the refrigerator duty fell away.
A new category lauds socially responsible firms
Estimation criteria are humanitarian, environment projects, development projects or sport projects
A novelty in the this year's already fifth year of the competition of the financial newspaper (HN) is the category "responsible firm of the year 2010."
It is the basic idea of this competition to promote sensible and fair enterprises.
"We would want such firms support, that itself the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment deliberately are and socially responsible initiatives support," says Patrik Bartholdy, that regional manager of the mobile phone business Vodafon, that Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition is, just as as well as the competition "rebel of the year."
To the this year's first year of this special lower category of the head competition Vodafon firm of the year firms registered, for which the success is not the single long-term goal.
The story one of them is extremely inspirativ and would offer enough material for an independent article.
Although they diametrically differ with regard to the object of its activity, its efforts have nevertheless a joint denominator - support and consideration.
Here it concerns for example gehandicapte people, there around personal problems or the health of the own colleagues.
Under the fourteen finalist out of entirely the Czech Republic, so for example also the citizen of Prague emerged software business Et Netera, that does not promote the origin of formal sport teams under its colleagues, who participate then in numerous tournaments in most varied sports.
The company Isolit Bravo, that is is another example of a responsible firm out of the region Pardubice already for seventeen years main sponsor of a foundation fund for gehandicapte children.
Also a papermill out of attends exemplary to its healthwise hindered employed, who settle 70 percent of its personnel, for what it with the title "responsible firm of the region was lauded means bohemian"; in the competition Vodafone firm of the year it covered the third rank in the frame of this region.
In the region Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, that introduced among other things a fluent and moreover on on the average 35 hours per week reduced working hours, and this without comparative wage reduction.
The jury remunerated in the title award also the circumstance that the firm shops predominantly with Czech manufacturers, citizens' action groups in its environment supports and works after environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive us, as much as possible to recycle, around the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment if possible slightly to hold," explains its manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT business Enlogit out of the region Ústí nad Labem again is been got promotes used at the health of its colleagues and therefore it to all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, moreover it about its employed home work and in firm actions it Cartering services, that are offered by a domestic protected workshop, from them.
"In addition support we the foundation" people in need," the aid concrete the local Romany Kommunität perform," says Suchý, the representative of the firm.
Finally also the activity of the cleaning firm is not contributes "Praní a out of the Karlsbad region worth mentioning, that its employed in form of extra bonuses to its pension insurance fund.
"We grant our employed of contributions to the provisions, for the work way, to the increase of its qualification and for the vacation," says Josef of the construction company Czasch out of Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch Schlesischen region.
Firm of responsible to the category the year were registered automatically all district finalists of the competition Vodafon firm of the year, that answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed the registration and sent it at the latest to that 15. August the organizer.
Incorrectly or incomplete filled out answers in the questionnaire were excluded of the organizer out of the estimation.
"If the representatives of the bet striving firms let the questions unanswered, they were excluded of the competition" responsible firm of the year," however were not disqualified in the head competition Vodafone firm of the year it therefore."
"A separate registration only to this competition is not possible, because it solely a lower category of the head competition firm of the year is," declared Karel Goldman of the arranging agency Bison & rose.
Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police in a public announcement
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen undertook the Antikorruptionspolizei in the last days arrests.
At the same time the local medium entrepreneur and real estate agent Lubo G was taken away. of the detectives in handcuff.
This had tried nominally to manipulate a just taking place public competition to the settlement of restitution claims so that the plots of land offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
This should have paid Lubo G. for that a half million.
"At this time can I only confirm, that the police a person because of the offense of deceitful wheelings and dealings in a public competition pursues," said Antonie Zelená, the boss of the Pilsner district attorney's office of the newspaper "Právo," further details could it with regard to the running investigations do not grant.
The 46-year-old entrepreneur later became release 24 hours of the police again.
On which manner was able to manipulate it the public competition, about that one only can speculate in view of the sparse official information.
The speaker of the ground fund Lubomír cited had undertaken on the question relating to this of Právo, that police in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund actually arrests and this during a public competition.
"It concerned a client and by no means around one our colleagues," concretized it.
The public competition had woman according to the correct label "request to the making of the offer of claims to the transfer of plots of land in accordance with the ground law" and would take place in cases, in which several applicants interests in the offered plot of land share.
"These people offer a higher value in the frame of the request its through the transmission to settling restitution claims, than the exclaimed plot of land value."
"Corresponding to the offered claims becomes the sequence of the potential Erwerber determined, subsequently transfers the ground fund the plot of land to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. information was available obviously, who had registered on the request there and was there he even justified person, because he had bought himself a row of restitution claims, offered he on to a plot of land interest that he withdraws out of the competition.
Obviously against a fat settlement.
That would be also a sufficient explanation why it had in its arrest such one large cash amount with itself.
Luboš G. had already all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund in the past.
So he played also in the Causa of the earlier boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota a role that was pursued criminal, because he published into replacement restitutions plots of land, to which already location decisions were pleases become building intention.
At that time Lubo G acquired more exactly said. of the ground fund for example also plots of land, that were intended for the building of public streets,, at the place where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale was planned to the business zone of Borské poles.
Later it exchanged far exceeded this very favorably with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, that the value of the plots of land.
The city hall must at that time heavy heart small addition in order to not to endanger the building intention through the blockage of the plots of land.
The accustomed costs of the households climb around several hundred monthly
The households must reckon as of January not only with higher costs for all energy types, but rather also with higher water fees and sewage fees and for district heating and many a plotted, also the rents grow.
Families will have to pull so as of January several hundred crowns monthly more out of the wallet than previously.
Current becomes until around 4.6 percent more expensive, gas around 2 percent and more, in many cities becomes one to one-tenth more for water deliveries pay must and mark up many a plotted also the district heating deliveries.
Alone the current increase in prices costs the dwelling households annually several hundred crowns more.
The power current prices were reduced at the same time of all head suppliers, guilt is therefore the clear support of the current production on renewable authority, nominally out of Fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas become to be sure only moderate more expensive, this to be sure exactly then if the people must heat most and have the highest consumption.
Also here is to be reckoned therefore with several hundred crowns more per year.
While current and gas become throughout the Czech Republic more expensive, the prices are for district heating different from city to city.
Price increases plan above all larger places.
So for example the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay as of January more for district heating monthly up to 50 crowns, pay more than 1000 crowns more per year families in Liberec.
9 percent threaten the inhabitants of Prague again water fees and sewage fees higher and this for the case that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, only 6.8 percent are it.
The price in Prague belongs in comparison with entirely the Czech Republic however also further to the lowest.
In the north bohemian where the prices belong already now to the highest, should climb water fees and sewage fees around 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140,000 rent dwellings, with which as of January that so-called. Rent regulation is omitted.
So for example the dwelling business CPI Byty, that possesses 2500 dwellings in Ústí nad Labem, plans, that to raise rents as of January immediately by hundred percent.
He, who is not agreed with this rent increase, that judicially wants to sue the business.
The regulated rents, that one pays today yet in approximately 300,000 dwellings, would be allowed to increase next year around more than 10 percent.
Czech children betrinken with Fernet and around beer out is itself - it causes simply too slowly
Fernet, around and vodka, exceptionally also once a good whiskey that one stole the father out of the house bar.
Those are the drinks after whose enjoyment drunk Czech teenagers must need treated become under fifteen most frequently.
Children, who must have a good sleep its tom-cat repeatedly in the hospital, are no exception.
This follows out of the experiences of physicians, who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the child departments by clinics.
"Beer or wine are entire out of the fashion because it lasts simply too long, until one is" drunk.
"The current trend is unambiguously hard alcohol," said Právo Pelikán, the superintending doctor of the child department in the mittelböhmischen clinic.
"Whiskey if it succeeds to steal the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage, that one it with Juice mix can, smells it not so strongly," explains the superintending doctor.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eve Jurinová gives it quite.
"Most frequently it concerns Fernet or around."
"That is the current alcohol trend, nominally at elementary schools."
"Isolated concerned it also Slibowitz, that one of at home brings," led woman Jurinová on.
According to superintending doctor Pelikán thirteen or fourteen four ten-year drinkers in the hospitalization are a long time no exception appearance.
Before the clinic in at that it for this year has worked, was it for ten years in the paediatrics department of the hospital Motol active where the rescue vehicles students drunken delivered from far and wide.
"A girl had to become" four times hospitalisiert.
"Your career began it at 12 years of age when they the first time with 3.5 Promille alcohols in the blood and yet in addition in combination with" Extase" delivered became," described the physician an especially heavy case.
"You was in the display terrain in would getšovice on any dance party."
"The interesting at the same time was, that it its mother not at all strangely occurred, that its daughter 48 hours not home came," is surprised the superintending doctor.
Just the missing interest of the parents or its incredible tolerance in the activating with the own offsprings applies as one of the primary cause to the growing alcoholism of children.
Around a real dependence in the true sense of the word, it does not go according to expert with children.
"Under alcoholism, a long-time chronic dependence of the alcohol is to be understood including all phenomenon of therewith related and is that at these children not the case."
With which, that enjoy repeatedly alcohol, mostly a negative informally social Background is characteristic," explains superintending doctor Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital Motol, woman according to Jurinová, were instructed until in the middle of November approximately forty drunk children into the local department for child medicine and youth medicine.
However only the cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that made a hospitalization required go in into the statistics.
Drunk children, who are brought after ambulatory treatment by the parents or if necessary by the police home, are not registered.
Except the cases, in which children only once so a bottle hard liquor in the school bench finish gives it in the opinion of of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes on which hundred percent reliance is: Whale pure g sharp night, new year's eve and the end of the school year.
"The last-named for two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad testimony or out of joy on the vacation."
"In the whale pure g sharp night have I also already seven drunk children all at once in the reception experiences," emphasizes doctor Pelikán.
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better at it when a child who has to fight at the next day only with an unpleasant tom-cat.
The headache at the morning after that, that stem of the Dehydration and of the glucose deficiency, one can banish in the hospital namely with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion with glucose and nutrient, that are missing the organism.
"You are unambiguously better at it, for after the" lovely" experience in the evening, rouse somewhat blow does it with good mood, without that somewhere."
"You are only something confuses about that, where it are," clears doctor Pelikán on whereby he ruins the patient sometimes at least through it the good mood, in that he itemizes them the costs, that it will cost the treatment.
For the carrier with the rescue vehicle and the night in an acute bed come good and gladly on a couple hesitated thousand crowns.
"There and again have I that as an upbringing means uses, if I directly the children in the visit enumerated would have, what its drunkenness cost has and that it thoroughly happen can, that it once the entire vacation over work must, around the money for an only such party to earn," joined doctor Pelikán thereto.
According to its opinion the health insurance companies do not grasp however after recourse procedure, around which to the healing of the trunkenen children necessary costs of the parents call for.
Two training airplanes L-159 for the first time in strange hand - in Spain
Two easy military aircraft L-159 of altogether five, that the Czech defense ministry against the carrier airplane Casa C-295M exchanged, flew on Tuesday into the Spanish city Sevilla where the Spanish airplane manufacturer settles Casa - EADS.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a strange army.
Abroad they were to be seen previously solely in maneuver or Flugshows.
It concerns herewith the flight capable Zweisitzerversion L-159T1, that was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three airplanes are einsitzige L-159.
These vouch presently yet preserves in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the firm Omnipol - received it past week.
When it dispatches the airplanes physically out of Vodochody, is Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the defense ministry according to not yet well known.
The einsitzigen military aircraft L-159 again were separated out of long-termed warehoused airplanes and this without further enclosures and investments on the part of the department of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 became in present condition and appearance exchanged," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
It added, the army would not have to come out without two-seater military aircraft because the defense ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-Millionen-Vertrag 200-Millionen-Vertrag million 200-Millionen-Vertrag contract over the reconstruction of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new airplane received the army in July, the second wants to receive it until end of this year.
According to Pejšek EADS promised to put through the military aircraft into the equipment one NATO of countries.
"In the contract is cited plainly and clearly that the business is EADS buyer of the airplanes L-159 and that this to the education of pilots NATO of countries should serve.
"It is therefore thing of the buyer, on which manner he the thing realizes," led Pejšek on.
The financial newspaper (HN) had reported formerly that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against a carrier airplane Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved in the past year yet by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The defense ministry had written out at that time no announcement procedure to the purchase, but rather EADS spoke directly on.
The at that time defense velvet argued, this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it uses only 24, it wanted to sell the remainder.
The purchase of the airplanes Casa would be allowed to have by the way also another judicial aftermath.
The European commission accused the Czech defense ministry namely at the European court. The reason? It should have selected the airplanes based on an entire European announcement and by no means through response a single manufacturer.
The army received already three airplanes Casa, that land should last on the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk to become ill with cancer
Men whose index finger is longer, than the ring finger, are stopped obviously a slighter risk to become ill with prostate cancer.
That is the surprising result of a study that was published on Wednesday by the British journal of Cancer.
That should hold together namely with the mirror of the masculine hormone testosterone.
"Our results show, that the relative length of the fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer serve can and this nominally with men until sixty," explained the with author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the university in Warwick.
The finger could help subject should, above all, themselves so to determine, which men unconditionally if genetic risks or other risk factors are available, like for example informal health loads to a prostate cancer test, joined woman Eeles thereto.
In the period of 1994-2009, it pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, simultaneously however also 3000 healthy men with its colleagues in Britain.
With more than the half of the participants of the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer counted how for 19 percent of that men, whose ring and index fingers were equally long.
With men, whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk sank however around 33 percent, with men until sixty quite around 87 percent.
The ratio of the length both mentioned finger, that form already in the prenatal age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormone which the child in the uterus was stopped.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier researches yielded that just the testosterone of the growth accelerates of prostate cancer.
Václav of leading Czech genetics and former chairperson of the academy the sciences, said would be it this study fleetingly well known, nevertheless it would consider proved" the ratio between the finger length and the cancer risk not yet to be "totally.
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are blocked
Just as that the largest part of Europe also the Czech Republic lies on Thursday morning under a snow cover.
On the streets and sidewalks, mostly gotten stuck snow, the Winterdienstler lies were in many places the entire night on axis.
The freeway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 toward Rozvadov is some accidents of truck and automobiles because of blocked and "stands" also the D1 in Brno toward Prague.
This said Novinky. CZ of the Dispatcher of the headquarters car-Moto-club (ÚAMK).
In kilometers 91, a truck perished knocked gives, in kilometers 93 two trucks together, in this accident it injured.
Also a couple of automobile lie in the street ditch.
There is problems also in kilometers 185 of the freeway D1 toward Prague.
Also here two trucks collided.
The drivers should depart immediately behind Brno in kilometers 190 or should go over Brno and rise in kilometers 182 in the place Kývalka.
There several kilometers long obstructions form namely.
Also on the D11, an accident happened and that immediately in the driveway to Prague.
In Prague itself, a snow cover thick several centimeters and the thermometer lies shows minus seven degrees centigrade.
Car columns form for example in the Stadteil Prosek, also the street is clogged totally.
The most certain transportation is there in any case the Metro.
The streetcars go with delays, for example on the line between Karl place and peace place.
At eight o'clock mornings the citizen of Prague convenes crisis team.
Also in the railroad and on the airport, there is problems.
The Czech country train had to nullify because of snowdrifts seven express train connections.
There is problems for example on the stretch Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
The travelers should inform themselves unconditionally about the current situation.
The airport is closed for Wednesday 11 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most streets in Südmähren are passable only with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side-streets are form totally impassable, in the environment of Brno in places snowdrifts and in the environment of Blansko, one is forced to use on many more highly lain streets snow milling machine.
Výškov is one of the most concerned areas.
There three streets are blocked still totally: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - and also Šaratice - would paintšovice.
Also here one will have to use to the snow clearances snow milling machine.
When they become again passable, do not let estimate itself until now.
In the region Hodonín, caution is announced in the field of the white Carpathian Mountains.
On the streets, that may be scattered out of environmental protection reason solely with inerten scatter means, lies a snow cover thick up to five centimeters, led on.
In the Czech Republic fell of two to ten centimeters of new snow, most in north bohemian - in places until 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch Schlesischen region fell up to 15 centimeters of new snow.
In the Czech Republic, it stops however slowly snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops used in Afghanistan for the first time a new "intelligent" weapon, that is previously only under its code name XM-25 well known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the balance of forces to its favor.
The new weapon is so something, like a super exact canon.
Your projectiles are directed namely per laser with an accuracy of only some few meters into the goal.
The special stories of calibers 25 mm, that were developed for this weapon and contain highly explosive explosive material, function practically like small garnets.
The stories can be programmed so that they can explode not only in the impact on the goal, but rather at an any point of its ballistic flight path.
That is, one it can use against an enemy, who hides behind a hindrance - a wall or in the marksman ditch.
From above it not usually is protected namely, can set the homicidal Stahlsplitterregen from above it therefore easily except combat.
According to Richard Audett, that at the development of the XM-25 tade part, is the new battle weapon the first infantry weapon that makes utilize itself "intelligent" technologies to.
"The soldier advances taken adjusts in the reason so: he the goal on and sends out a laser ray, that determines the distance, wins he an exact visor point, after which he corrects the increase angle, needs to fire he only.
"Let's say once, one measured" 543 ms.
"If one fires, the weapon loads itself and shoots down the story on the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 Jobs are shifted
The group Fujitsu shifts its agency in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year 400 colleagues will transfer its job of the previous office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg into the Astro park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu shifts its agency in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
How the industry giant specialized on computer and its maintenance announced on Wednesday, will transfer in July next year 400 women and men its job by the previous office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg into the Astro park, is that a large office complex at the Lyoner street in the Frankfurt quarter low wheel.
A speaker of Fujitsu clarified, should be accommodated medium-termed there even further 100 jobs of the group, that would be distributed among the region previously.
The rent offer had been extremely attractive, would come moreover the greater area offices in the Astro park of the mode of operation of the colleague better toward.
Also in bath Homburg, Fujitsu had been solely tenant.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt low wheel have we a central location with outstanding infrastructure found."
Let the excellent involvement at the airport be straight for a global business such as Fujitsu of large importance.
The renewed move of an important business within the region evoked yesterday joy at the winners and disappointment at the losers.
That Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (Christian Democratic Union) said, had been won therewith again a "globally Player."
Let that be a "magnificent location confession."
Fujitsu fits to the city, let the settlement be an important impulse for low wheel.
The baths Homburger mayor Michael Korwisi (the green) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management about the intention.
"We have the business obviously our aid offered," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts would have been able to change however nothing at the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the real estate at the Marienbader place.
Last of all would have been the deciding factor economic reasons.
Now it goes therefore to prevent a long empty state at so prominent place.
"I hope, the owner and landlord of the building appears cooperatively."
The house previously used by Fujitsu at the city hall place and the neighboring "small vertical" belonged with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago to the most disputed building intention of the cure city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new Stadtentree, that provided both because of the massive development of the areas used before partly as parking lot and the height of the buildings for criticism, emerged between railway station and city hall.
2001 related the Anlageberatungs- and Ratingunternehmen feri, the software manufacturer for trip distribution systems, starts Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer connected at that time yet with Siemens Fujitsu the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu German was acquired 2006 of that Frankfurt real estate-chances-group together with the Morgan Stanley actually Estate finding and SOWED further sells a year later at the Spanish Falcon actually Estate Investments in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Konuzern introduced in Tokyo designates itself as a third largest IT provider of the world.
It allocates business for example computer and server and performs also the necessary services.
The agency in the Rhine-Main-zone is counts one of the largest in Germany, by far more employed Fujitsu to be sure in Munich.
Out of bath Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt low wheel takes in should be, the further subsidiaries at this location Fujitsu services and a business by the name of TDS.
For that Astro parks 7000 were rented in the office building square meter.
Complex old in the twenty year - the name plays on its star-shaped outline at - the central association electrotechnology industry and electronics industry has among other things its seat.
Amazon blocks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks runs increasingly in oppression.
The Internet service provider Amazon banished the uncovering platform of its servers.
Possibly political pressure is behind it after the publication hunderttausender of secret diplomat wire.
Wikileaks founder Assange stays nominally in England.
The uncovering platform Wikileaks runs in the United States always more strongly under gunfire.
The Internets activists lost the access to its previous American server and seek now an Internet homeland in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called meanwhile other countries and business to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, that stands on the search lists of Interpol, should stay after a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks of Amazon server displaces."
"Free speech in the country of the free," announced the uncovering activists per short intelligence service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet business Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents of its servers.
The Internets activists had grasped back service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic wire on the Amazon webs in order to be able to master the high access numbers on the documents.
Per Twitter, Wikileaks to the step explained further: "Prime - our dollars are issued now in order to busy" people in Europe.
If Amazon would have such problems with the speech freedom, "should it stop, books selling."
Amazon had stopped the utilization of its servers through Wikileaks after colleagues of senator would have engaged Joe Lieberman investigations, reported the television station CNN with reference to the office Liebermans.
The chairperson of the senate committee for homeland protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"I would have me wished, that Amazon this measure earlier seizes in view of the prior publications of classified information through Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman called meanwhile in addition to forbid the platform also in other countries the utilization to servers.
Action illegal, terrible and ruthless "Wikileaks' sets our national security on the game and endangerd all around the globe life," was named it in a communication of the impartial senator.
"No responsible business - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread" stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, that is sought because of rape suspicion by the authorities in Sweden, stands on the search list of Interpol.
After a report of the Londoners newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain stays would be, the exact place Scotland yard well known.
The Internet activist designated the ascertainments in Sweden always as an intrigue of its opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, there had been threats.
"There were even calls after an assassination of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange fears right around its security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder would hold himself therefore further hidden.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements out of North America.
In America, the earlier republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible should be accused and executed for the Wikileaks uncovering because of treason.
In Canada, an adviser of head of the government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said should "killed become" on television, Assange and could use" Obama "a drone.
Between the white house and Assange, an exchange of blows flared up meanwhile.
The speaker of the American Präsidenten Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, named it "laughably and absurdly" that Assange the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton had demanded, if she is responsible for most young well known become espionage requests at diplomats.
"I am certain not entire, why we us around the opinion of a type with a web page worry," so Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one web page."
The American government places now the protection of its databases comprehensively on the test bed.
As a special delegate, the vice director of the center had been appointed for Anti-terror-measures, Russell Travers,, divided the white house with.
Let Travers be for that responsible to develop "necessary structural reforms," that had become after the disclosure of the message reports through Wikileaks necessary.
The white house wants to review let also the ways how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government announced moreover to want to provide for the security of dissidents and most active, should run it through the Wikileaks publication in danger.
"We have everything undertaken, with them in contact to step," said outside office speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are available to protect it if that should" become necessary.
The ice university
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day mean course for future Gelatieri has the largest demand and visitor out of the entire world.
From where does the entire ice come actually?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice confectioner, produces the cream after all rules of the Italian ice maker art.
The Gelataio gets the ice cream with a Spachtel out of the cool counter, paints it into the waffle and sells it then.
In order to know that, one doesn't have to go to Anzola Dell' Emilia in the province Bologna.
But who yet more over ice do not know would like to come, that at the "Gelato University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani past.
The manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 arranged the ice university so that the ice cream becomes that out of its machines everywhere high Italian ideal just.
The three-day mean course for future Gelatieri has the largest demand and visitor out of all world.
There are however also multi-day special courses all around the chocolate ice and practical courses in the company-internal ice hall.
Somebody dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new career, others venture themselves simply once on the smooth ice of its vague longings.
It are this time 40 participants out of 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, the Slow-Food-movement loves and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is management consultant and wants to bag after years in a nerve-racking job something own.
Two young egyptians dream therefrom to open an ice hall in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in its bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because its children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first of all the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Decisively not only good taste is, but rather also the silky pliability and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the creme hood of the national and generally southern superstructure in its training however also: "Italian Gelato is simple the best - and then is yet a lot of romanticism there."
The first step to the manufacture seems very simply.
Luciano tips over the reason ingredients milk, creme, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large mix device, that heats with an electronic program of all on 85 degrees and cools off then immediately on four degrees.
Then it loosens a rooster at the machine, and out a pasteurized white basis cream, base comes for all milk ice sorts.
Immediately the instructor with questions is stormed: Can one produce ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?
How can one let the own experiment desire free course?
Luciano warns before that let lead be mistaken of the zeitgeist in that.
He, who would speak of ice cream "only out of natural ingredients," used if possible nevertheless stabilizers - usually a nature product, about Guarkernmehl out of the Guarbohne.
Naturally one can produce ice also without stabilizer, only must sell become it then within one day, otherwise sackt it in itself together, and the customer bites on pure ice grain.
Certain variations at the standards are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano between the ingredients, that one buys in the fruit department or in the candies of the supermarket, distinguishes.
Moreover there are gives powder and paste.
"The suppliers will try everyone to turn on" you dozens of additions aromatized.
"But you should experiment" simply once.
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just in the ice cream out of the white standards, that becomes with eggs the yellow cream, and with cocoa powder to the base for all possible chocolates seductions.
Now the course participants may at the ice machines.
Luciano lets produce it respectively four different types of vanilla, chocolate produce, mocha produce and produce hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the standards, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additions.
Also the fruit ice sorts are subjected to the same experiment.
More aroma material, more fruit Püree - taste laughed is that not unconditionally better.
Hazelnut ice does not taste unconditionally nussiger if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the team, that uses more fruits, less water and somewhat less stabilizer.
First a well-balanced mixture lifts the taste of a Gelato really forth, says Luciano.
Ice manufacture is a math problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar share in the reason prescription must be diminished.
For lemon ice, an extra portion sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls a device forth, with that it the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (wine-grower measure therewith the Oechsle in the grape cider).
Luckily tables ease the calculate.
To make ice required no longer so much physical use such as earlier.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the standards helps.
There simultaneously creamy is struck also a device, in that the finished ice mixture and cooled becomes on temperatures below freezing.
Small breakdowns do not stay away all automation to the defiance.
The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from above until below with Fruchtpüree when it the oversized hand blender except inspection runs.
"In every course," means Maestro Luciano, "is it only a matter of time, until so something happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
The European groceries authority Efsa would be infiltrates of the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation the expert group formulates now test biotech that understands itself as an independent institute for the consequence estimation of the biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documents," said test biotech boss Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
Let the leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and a further Efsa expert have been for years also at the lobbyist association Ilsi under contract.
That becomes of groups such as Monsanto, fumble or pays Bayer.
Kuiper had cooperated authoritatively on the Efsa test directions for gene plants and stand therewith in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
Let the Efsa directions be paragraph by paragraph word same with position paper the Ilsi and deceive therewith the handwriting of the industry that is supposed to be controlled actually by the authority in the Italian Parma.
Let it be already the second time that test biotech would criticize an interest collision.
So let a high-ranking Efsa manager be most young without levies or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and would have therewith the sides changed.
Also the central german broadcast (MDR) had revealed recently personnel connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, what clairaudient made the environment federal bureau just as as EU parliamentarian.
The Efsa can recognize meanwhile no conflict of interest.
Fall back on all serious data, also on such of the industry as long as they would be of high professional quality, is named it in an attitude.
Of the experts, who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contacts to the industry.
They would have to disclose this however.
Kuiper clears its work for that internationally Life Sciences institutes (Ilsi) in the USA.
This designates itself as a neutral forum for experts out of science, industry and politics - among other things to the risk estimation for biotechnology without lobby order.
In the thing, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically changed plants are allowed presently with no feeding attempt with animals and the reaction would not be tested by gene plants on environment influences.
"We want to know, what for example genetically changed corn on the field makes," says Then.
Let it be the present practice to not to test solely isolated proteins, but the entire gene plant, what would deliver no reliable results.
Does "if one not seek the risks, how one should find" it then?, asks Then accusing.
That sees also Angelika Hilbeck so.
The scientist has searched since 1994 in genetic engineering and is presently at the technical university Zurich active.
The industry tries on this zone such as in the USA also in Europe now more and more to influence or to discredit critical scientists.
There is therefore hardly yet researcher who would not be entangled with groups.
Studies critical for business not as a rule would be published.
"The industry controls the security research," maintains Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell obtained also which, altogether about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening it stood before the Stuttgarter railway station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September the excavators were advanced and had begun to interrupt a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter world was no longer that: Umpteen thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion heavy Tieferlegung of the railway station.
When it came to the building stop, a large part of the wing in ruins lay.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell chalk, a soft coarse stone, between 1914 and 1920 builds in.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured himself a couple of the chunks.
"These stones are relic."
"You may not disappear."
It enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simply and erdenhaft."
When it sawed up one, that had raked after cigarette smoke.
It does not know, what it will make with the chunks, yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of the Stuttgarter stones leads wrestled erected has into a forest in Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel its stone empire.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
It bought everyone, that occurred in the abstract in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, it would become crushed rock ground or in the dump disappear," says it in its office, a wood booth, that was once an awake cottage.
Sworn at and threatened would have one it, tells it when in September in the newspapers stood, that it had bought the remainders of the north wing of the discontinuance entrepreneur.
But it spoke with the S-21-Gegnern, day after day.
And it explained to them that it could yet now nothing at all for the abstract.
And if it would happen now once, let it be yet the sensiblest if the stones became further related.
About 200 S-21-Gegner one of the on average 80 kilogram rectangular solids brought itself thereupon, unit price 6.50 to 14 Euro.
As a memory, some however also in the hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had wrestled bought, 25 large truck load.
About the half stores yet in the forest, the remainder is sold a long time.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
Of everywhere, they had come and would have way dragged, what trunk and follower were able to carry.
The Stuttgarter stones of the impetus changed themselves a long time in "Mäuerle" or in limitations of herb flowerbed.
"Is actual this stone nothing special," says wrestled.
The political component" "were not.
It climbs in its terrain vehicle, makes a tour through its 20 hectare large empire.
It studied and interrupted law, late biology, was interested it in computer and became in the end stone dealer.
And stone lover.
It stores 40000 tons of stone.
Out of entirely Germany karrt it its treasures together.
It says, it would be the largest old stone dealer of the republic.
It brakes.
In the snow, skillful hew sandstones lie.
"You belonged once to that Dresden Marienbrücke," tells it.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warmly, it enthuses.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way highly through the forest.
It shows on a pile: red sandstone, early part the Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once the rectangular solids to the platform of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadions belonged.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin out of the Stuttgarter police headquarters, reddish granite out of the cathedral saint bubble ions, Tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
Which work, which striving, which sweat.
If wrestled on that thinks, how the stones were chopped earlier per hand and were moved with simple pulleys and ox cart, becomes it entirely respectful.
"It would be yet a scandal if one became" so something schreddern.
It became not empire, stinking rich already not at all.
The stone dealer busied established himself but 14 people, moreover above today in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a smith, a Glasbläser and a garden farmer.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the remainder utilizer.
Soon it must to Cologne.
Also there there is, to rescue stones.
Talent battle around High potential
Lively press rules at the Buffet.
16 students press themselves around salmon roll, tomato soup and sweet.
The mechanical engineering students and design students to a workshop invited the technical University of Braunschweig and the car farmer Volkswagen.
In a kind of idea competition, they should together fachsimpeln with VW developer over the car of the future - and very incidentally become acquainted with Volkswagen.
In the contest around the smartest heads, many businesses go meanwhile into the near battle and set, like VW, on cooperations with the universities.
Your mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates if possible early in the auditoriums before they come on the labor market and are courted of others.
And because the universities publish no assemblies over the achievements of its students, to spot tried one the exception talents in practice projects and to tie to itself.
At the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweigs, the car group seeks the talents.
A young lady out of the personnel department distributes ball-point pen, Gummi Bear and portfolios with VW Logo.
It tells the hopeful boy talents of practical course programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group up.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweigs looks after the project with VW.
It sees the advantages for both sides: "The students get in touch to the industry and gather experiences."
"VW can become acquainted with simultaneously students, more closely can look at interesting candidates and consider, who would come" as a colleague into question.
Such cooperations, so Selle, are not unusual.
Would be new that so offensive around the students gebuhlt would become.
"Otherwise lay the focal point sooner on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for that graduated fresh will become probably even harder.
In many industries, the businesses can choose themselves its colleagues no longer out of a large multitude of applicants.
They separate must extol itself and court especially around highly qualified labor forces.
Above all graduates out of the engineer disciplines are at the same time in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the association, Germans engineers VDI remained in October over 40,000 engineer places unoccupied.
And the so-called engineer space will become according to VDI prognoses even larger.
For the accounting business and consultation business KPMG, novel Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
It organizes costly Recruiting events such as about the KPMG Race, a type modern chip hunt with which the participants on the basis of GPS coordinate must find its way.
The business wants to send eight very promising students diagonally through the USA so in the next year.
Very incidentally the participants can look at KPMG branch and can become acquainted with the business.
He who may with, decides in two selection round in the forefield.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants flies into the USA.
In the chopping and pricking around the High of potential at the universities, the guns become more and more according to Dykta larger.
"We want to remove" us with the Race out of the mass.
"Only a sail gates simple was us too little."
For talent hunter Dykta, the calculation seems to rise.
"We have contact" until today with all participants of a similar action in the last year.
"Some stand shortly before its conclusion and want itself soon here apply," says it.
Next to the direct Buhlen at the campus go above all small and middle-class business also very classically in occupation fairs on the Pirsch.
"We try to reach" graduate on trade fairs.
"About on the Intersolar," reports Sitha parlors, personnel leader at the solar technology manufacturer solar world.
That Bonn business busied approximately 1500 colleague in Germany.
Parlors knows around the new generation problematic nature.
Presently places are written out on the business websites 35.
"It is to be occupied" just very heavy, vacant positions.
"That costs much time and money," says it.
A further way is the contact over the universities professors.
Solar world cooperates with different universities, about the university in free mountain.
"The professors give references that one make here practical courses or can" write its dissertation.
Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced at the solar specialist.
To advertise for that tried the business with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"That can a large group often do not offer," says personnel leader parlors.
Money plays more in the job search by far the leading role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for advancement are further decisive factors.
Solar world covered in a study of the Great Place to caused institute the 55th place under the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute generates an annual best list of German employers.
In addition it questioned colleague such as satisfied it with its work and its job background are and views on the general conditions for the employed.
Personnel leader parlors hopes for herself of the positioning also advantages at the job-seekers.
"I think, that applicant especially after external estimations over a potential employer view," says it.
Wolf of pure Kriegler of the Germans Employer Branding academy advises business that want to build up with a long-term strategy a good call as an employer.
It advises its customer to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way, itself as an employer attractively to make, leads over the own colleagues," says he.
In the industry jargon, the internal Employer Branding is named, therefore employer brand development within the own personnel.
"Satisfied colleagues are the best ambassadors."
If one would treat its people well and identify it himself with the business, would advertise it entirely of alone with friends and acquaintance for its employer.
"That is like a game with volumes," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil borings
Before the coast of the US of state of Florida in the gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil borings in the coming years.
A corresponding ban the government in Washington released - and therewith its earlier plans finally revoke.
Also before the Atlantic coast, new borings remain first of all prohibited.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
Trigger for the strict ban, that should apply at least to the coming five years, the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" is in April.
Before the misfortune, that cost eleven workers life and led to the largest environment catastrophe of the USA, Präsident Barack Obama had signaled on pressure of the opposition and the industry its readiness to allow new borings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to diminish therewith the dependence of the USA of oil deliveries out of foreign countries.
He, who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the gulf, is clarified until today not in conclusion.
In the center of the criticism, the British energy group BP that is confronted with billion demands stands.
An investigation commission on behalf of Obamas should produce its results in the course of the December.
In October Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had canceled the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
In the connection, different oil groups had placed at once proposals for new drilling intention.
With sharper inspections and more severe security directions, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a renewed catastrophe.
Presently the responsible control authority, that had run after numerous corruption accusations in discredit, basically is reformed.
Parallel in addition Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil groups and gas groups.
The industry warns now publicly before that that the output in the gulf would fall out through a more severe regulation clearly slighter than previously.
"The plans of the government are the largest brake for the growth of the oil industry and gas industry," reads the result of a current industry survey through the adviser firm BDO - before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance laments moreover the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows, what becomes" exactly change with the regulation.
Investments into new promote projects would be delayed until further notice - zulasten of the growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: Crude oil discontinued billions liter destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people live of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari means it good.
"Plagues you not from," calms the organic activist the journalists: "You will get" today yet enough oil mud before the lens.
The 37-year-old Nigerian pursued the attempt to photograph one until boy wading to the breast in the water with the Schlieren surrounding it: In the regenbogenfarbenen water brightness, the scene causes almost lovely.
That under the surface brown Rohölschwaden float, is not to be seen.
Earlier it had gathered here by the bucket shrimps, tells Esther Badom at the bank of the Bodo-Jetty-river.
In the meantime let the sluggishly fluent waters be perfectly dead.
Five years ago enormous quantities crude oil poured out of a burst piping into the gigantic wetland.
Fishermen out of the nearly lain village Bodo must row now six hours in order to arrive into fish containing waters: The Ogoniland lain in the heart the Niger delta counts polluted as one of that most badly regions of the world.
On the trip through the mangrove swamps gotten through by river courses, the entire size of the devastation becomes obvious.
Broth brown instead of bright water wühlt the motorboat up, who immerses its hand into the water, extracts oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees jut like black licorice poles out of the ground, sadly let hang isolated palms trees to be found its fronds.
Bird swarm how they are usual otherwise in wetlands, seeks forgive one: As soon as the Außenborder is quiet, ghostly quiet spreads out in the paradise smelling earlier like a gas station.
"What here happens, is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in permanent danger for the health."
The war comparisons is mounted.
The settlement zone of the Ogoni is a battlefield fought over since decades: Here the first Explorateure screwed in had to adjust themselves before more from Europe, here than 60 years organized in the 80er-Jahren with the later executed author Ken Saro Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell groups 1993 its production because it became for its oil worker too dangerous.
Yet today the return is forbidden the business after Ogoniland: While out of the entire delta region by the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometer pipings are pumped daily more than two million casks of the black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland lie broke, is too unstabile the group the situation.
All couples of hundred meter jut steel stands such as bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" are named the heads of the drilling holes much too tender.
They are corroded up to 50 years old, that to the quick.
Again and again would break such a drilling head apart, means Akpobari, then groove a constant current crude oil into the water.
More than two billion liters flowed after expert estimations in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta: Year for year the quantity of oil, like it in the loss by sea of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" into the sea before Alaska 21 years ago penetrated - one of the largest environment catastrophes in the story of humanity.
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous organically GAU, about that is fought.
While the Shell group responsibly makes sabotage and the organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the soiling, conservationists see bursting drilling heads and would lick pipelines as a head cause.
Shell puts lower security standards in Nigeria substantially at than otherwise in the world usually, threw the US scientist Richard Steiner the group 2008 before: Alone let the rate of defects at the directions be "around a multiple higher than elsewhere."
At a place, that looks from a distance like a left, oil smeared workshop under free sky, shapes emerge out of the mangroves: They are stark naked and to the neck oil smeared.
Under one of the many casks, that connected partly with tubes to settle partly arbitrarily scattered on the terrain are, flickers a fire: an illegal small refinery.
In the cask, the crude oil is heated over the fire several hours long, explained Michael, the boss of the group.
First gasoline penetrates drips through the pipes into the catch pot, later at the end of the direction kerosene and in the end diesel out.
So Michael and four colleagues produce daily 300 liters up to four casks diesel à: "That brings us 34,000 Naira a" - approximately 22 dollar.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest petroleum country of black Africa.
Nigeria controls only a single refinery.
The illegal cooks yet can underbid the diesel price laughably low with nearly 40 Euro cents per liter: They get for its raw material for nothing.
It comes of "Bunkerern," that tap the pipeline network diagonally through Ogoniland: In this manner at least 16 million liters get lost the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily crude oil.
Only a disappearing small part of the provisionally between stored raw material illegally will refine to be sure: Organized criminal networks, to which also politician and high-ranking military should belong, fill the lion's share, in tanker and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environment catastrophe sooner that worried owed is the population or the lax production manner, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academically.
"Became not the oil companies as an intruder perceived and not so thoroughly would have destroyed it the basis of life of the fishermen, would give it neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime the ratio of the Ogoni would be destroyed above all to Shell however to such an extent that only a deduction of the group eligible: "Perhaps turn out yes other nationality such as the Chinese as better."
There Michael becomes nervous.
"Highest time, that you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Each minute the soldiers can come."
The illegal Ölveredler are caught threatens of the special unit of the military forces, them to be sure no arrest, probably however a painful bribe.
Also the soldiers coming especially out of the country north want to profit - like all Nigerians - by the raw material.
"This damned thing has our country in every regard on the dog brought," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous building mistake in A380-Triebwerken
The A380 has evidently a large security problem.
Investigators discovered a possible building mistake in the investigation of a made an emergency landing machine, that could lead to a "catastrophic engine loss."
The airline Qantas wants to accuse now the motor manufacturer.
The passengers of the made an emergency landing Qantas Airbus beginning November had evidently much more good fortune than until now well known: The Australian air security authority assessed a large security problem in its ascertainments in the engines of some A380-Maschinen - and warns now against a possible building mistake.
The potential defect would have heavy consequences: In an oil tube connection, it could produce fatigue tear and leak, was named it in a this Thursday published attitude of the authority ATSB.
This would have been able to lead to "a catastrophic engine loss."
Concerned would be produced engines in 20 airplanes the A380-Reihe of rolls Royce.
Under that the Qantas Airbus, that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on the 4th of November, is.
The Australian airline initiated now legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a complaint establishment in an Australian federal court in Sydney, that enable it further juristic measures against the business.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said, its airline would demand compensation for the incident beginning of November.
In the fire of the motor, parts had solved itself and had damaged the deceit areas.
Roll out Royce made an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
After the incident must be exchanged now worldwide up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further security tests at the super jumbo, that are equipped with the concerned engines.
Let the security recommendation be the result of a collaboration with rolls Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem would be for sufficiently important held become in order to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380-Flotte for weeks on the ground.
Singapore airline let about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa exchanged the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The doppelstöckige flyer is the largest passenger airplane of the world.
Nationwide snowfall releases traffic chaos
Germany entirely in white: Overnight snow fell almost in the entire country.
On many streets, chaos, trains and flights rules fall from.
In car accidents, at least three people came around life.
The winter frostet Germany: In icy temperatures, the entire republic in the night is train snows nearly on the Thursday - what leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the East, partially 15 centimeters of snow covers thick lie.
On several freeways and many streets, the traffic strongly is restricted.
On the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service in the duration use was, dealt with the permanently newly up sore snow however not.
Moreover violent squalls swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal bureau for lake shipping and Hydrographie (BSH) expects Schleswig-Holstein of the morning at the Baltic Sea coast at storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters over the normal state.
In Saxons, the snowdrifts led on the freeways and main highways to considerable problems.
Loud the thunderstorm headquarters Meteomedia alarm step was announced in the Saxon Switzerland therefore violet - the highest step generally.
Partially fell provided there 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds for drifts.
There several trucks and cars got stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported large interferences on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind to coming to a standstill traffic and obstruction led.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were concerned of the snowfall.
According to German train it comes in Saxons, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria to considerable interferences.
Snow on the tracks, overthrown trees on the rails or supervision destroyed and yield are the main problems.
In Saxons, the distance traffic had to be adjusted from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In the Thuringian hall field, an ICE had to stop its trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were furnished of fire department people and rescue helpers with blanket, meal and drinks in the train.
Schneewinde swept over the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds to numerous Flugausfällen lead.
In Munich, already some annulments are reported according to a speaker of the flight information headquarters.
In Frankfurt / Main were painted loudly a Fraport speaker already 40 of flights.
Let the winter service be in the duration use.
To be sure would be would be available only a few shipwrecked person passengers at the airport, nevertheless for it still nearly 400 field beds.
On many streets, it came already on Wednesday evening to accidents.
In the evening a truck driver came in the collision with a train on a train transition in east Holstein around life.
The engineer easily was injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg it came based on snow-covered streets to a similar accident: Also here a truck was grasped on a train transition because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver came around life.
In the train, four passengers were injured - the stretch from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked therefore into the morning hours.
Moreover a 30-year-old woman died after she had flipped over with its car in Aschaffenburg on smooth street.
The meteorologists have a good message however yet: To be sure the snow becomes still loose and pulverig be and will swirl up therefore already in easy squalls.
But the wind will reduce itself.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted of fast and storming winding.
It remains to be sure very cold - plotted wise to minus 15 degrees.
German bank seeks a buyer for its Twin Towers
The Germans bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to a newspaper report, the money house seeks buyer for both office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Until to 500 million Euro the real estate could bring in.
Just recently bank made the Germans its group seat lovely: The Twin Towers in that Frankfurt bank quarter were modernized; in the mean time might the bank again at its old job back.
Yet now the financial group wants to get out the costs for the renovation evidently again - and searches for a buyer for both high-rises how the "Financial Times Germany" writes with reference to a speaker.
The speaker did not name reasons for the planned sale.
"We test always, whether it is more meaningful, real estate itself to possess or to sell and subsequently expected back," said it.
Therewith largest credit bank delivers Germany its headquarters already after short time again.
The bank had received the double towers first middle 2007 for 272 million Euro of the investors of a company-internal fund and had rehabilitated subsequently costly.
The energetic reconstruction devoured the statements after approximately 200 Million Euro.
A sale would bring the bank probably much money.
Industry expert renamed the value that estimate in the meantime in "Greentowers" towers according to the newspaper to be approximately 500 Million Euro.
Whether the buildings are sold again at a fund in the possession of the bank, or at an independent investor, would be presently yet open, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people thought in New Zealand of the spilled miners, that were declared after several explosions in a mine to be dead.
Yet always the corpses were not able to become safe because the security posture in the misfortune shaft is further precarious.
Before almost two weeks, it had come in the Pike River mine near the city Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners in the age between 17 and 62 years were spilled under days.
A probe had been let out there into the misfortune shaft, had discovered however no trace of surviving.
On the basis of the high concentration of poisonous gases and more further following explosions, no rescue powers were able to climb down for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that it would give no chance of survival for the buddies more.
The corpses were able to become not yet safe.
Now member and friends with a commemorative celebration reminded one of the dead.
Ten thousand people had met themselves in radiating sunshine in Greymouth on the neuseeländischen south island.
For two minutes, they were quiet.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets were to be seen, lamps and the names the buddy.
Also pictures and personal objects, under that garment and surfboard, found here its place.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags blew on halbmast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "out of the depths of the earth" again at the surface, said the neuseeländische Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came" home.
He could not with death of its son lock as long as he had not seen its corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son was spilled zen in the pit.
Next to the Prime Minister and member of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part at the commemorative celebration.
In the first explosion on the 19th of November, also miners of British and South African origin had been spilled.
Rescue workers began therewith to delete a fire in the interior of the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases would be displaced, would be begun therewith, the glowing temperatures in the interior of the mine down cool, said chief of police Gary Knowles to journalists.
To the hell, warrior!
Does Splatter to the art movie theater fit?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs old genre boundaries with its fighter epic "Walhalla Rising" newly.
At which audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A caught Viking warrior with only an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself of its tormentors and puts its opponents with almost superhuman powers in rows around - sounds ideally for young masculine spectators in search of bloody Action just because our hero makes use of gladly furious killing methods and tears its enemies already once the Gedärme out of the living body if he has bad mood.
On the other hand on eye says how it actually is named, the entire film over no word, and also the other figures let themselves at most once too on or two sentences or a couple of death scream agonizing carry away.
Otherwise is been quiet and indulged in the creepy beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, that offers the Viking world of about thousand years ago the scenery.
Ideally sooner for adult Cineasten with interest for existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautifully, if a film has several target groups, damage only if they mutually exclude itself.
Director Winding Refn counts since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy "Pusher" as a type Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoic to make its works with somewhat more humor the Mainstream or somewhat less brutality the Arthouse accessibly.
Most art movie theaters friends would be allowed to deter let themselves of the brain mass injecting around and the Gedärmen.
The Action fans die at the latest then before boredom if on eye breaks open out of freely interpretierbaren reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and festival sticks an eternity in recession and fog before the team arrives evidently in America and is quiet there further.
No wonder therefore that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany found no movie theater distribution and appeared now only on DVD.
That is especially because of the grand pictures a lamentation, but also because behind the prätentiösen until bloody facades an at times exciting piece of movie theater hides itself, that earned something attention.
In this film, it does not concern is dialogues or a compelling action, it all atmosphere, a film become fever dream.
And out of that, there is no escaping for the spectator.
Refn grants it hardly a moment of the relaxation and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark trance good Soundtrack very slowly the throats to, above all however with the inconceivable hate, that strikes it out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, who stands faithfully to the side to on eye, preserved be driven himself something akin to innocence, everyone others of wrath.
At the very most the one-eyed hero whose subjects never are explained, who becomes however for enemies and temporary ally sometime the warrior out of the hell, if possible to the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruining, perhaps however also only for that anyway ruined.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that one can hate and admire, for annoying, excitement and marveling.
An experience.
Mysterious earth works
The atom energy authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country defends to take itself however, in addition position - yet lets it inspections to.
Against midnight of that 5th on the 6th of September 2007 at least four Israeli F attack-15 I military aircraft a mysterious, cubic building in Syria.
It stands at the bank of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometer away, is Dair ace Saur.
Your name emerges in documents of the international atom energy authority (IAEA) if it concerns the reactor, that Syria nominally with aid from North Korea in the rectangular solid constructed has, hidden in a valley, that walks of the current.
According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA of the end of April 2008 the reactor familiar also under the name the near village el Kibar would have been well suitable, to produce plutonium - out of that construct let itself nuclear weapons.
For other purposes on the other hand the technology is useful out of the fifties hardly.
A video presentation led the CIAS before with fuzzy satellite pictures.
Per computer animation, it faded in where which components of the reactor are supposed to have been before the destruction, that a reduced copy of the North Korean model would be out of the atom center Yongbyon.
Moreover it produced photos, that show the building out of the vicinity, or quite the inner rooms.
The reactor would be stood shortly before the starting, was named it, but not yet with fuel rods equips been.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, is became hardly more well known as at that time, yes the riddles gradually rather larger.
The earlier US President George W. Bush revealed most young in its memoirs that the CIAS quite certainly was themselves before the attack to be sure, that Syria in el Kibar constructed a reactor, but saw hardly criteria that there was in the country "an active nuclear weapon program."
Many secret-service agents in Europe are there rather yet more carefully and speak only about one "alleged reactor," also if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible."
Hard proofs are missing you, just as as the IAEA.
Asked how certain it would be, to have a reactor before itself, answered a high UN diplomat in the summer only succinctly, the IAEA would have "enough material in order to ask" questions.
The Syrians created the debris of the alleged "unused military building" to be sure hurriedly aside and flattened the terrain thoroughly.
Nevertheless an IAEA team found in June 2008 under the earlier chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, that had been produced of people.
Moreover the IAEA received be might over a member state of satellite pictures of supplier commercial out of the time directly after the attack, that statement strong as that of the CIA of presented.
To be sure these receptions not to are got on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - exclusively bought it.
The IAEA cannot verify therefore its authenticity independently.
Syria always assured, operated never a secret atom program or to have constructed a reactor.
The uranium comes of the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
Yet that rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particle as unlikely.
Since then Damascus refuses to discuss about that - just as over the satellite pictures.
Moreover it forbids the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and the access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But also Israel is quiet iron.
"We become that never comment on," strengthened most young the premier officiating at present the attack Ehud Olmert the official position.
So the investigation drags the if since June 2008 futilely there and, like a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna have accrued to "develops increasingly to a serious credibility problem for the authority" - in the end stands a heavy offence against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the room, over that the IAEA is awake itself.
As a key to progress in the clarification, the IAEA sees stand should evidently three further arrangements, that "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor - and unlike these yet exist.
At the same time the inspectors neither disclosed until now, still have around which plants it acts itself, which function it or what lets appear it suspicious.
After information of the southern German newspaper, they are designated in the IAEA internal as a Marj ace sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, diverted again by nearly lain cities.
The independent institute for Science and internationally Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and foundly made a building complex on satellite pictures in Masyaf, suspect concerns in that it most likely one of that objects.
It is possibly in or directly next to a military base - exactly with this establishment forbids Syria of the IAEA the access to the three places.
In Vienna, it is named feared, that Syrians a fishing sending - that the IAEA of the USA before adept would become, around military plants auszuspähen.
For the nuclear detectives had become through a tip of the US secret services on the arrangements attentive.
The IAEA has references, under that satellite photos that between the three places and the rectangular solid at the Euphrates material was transported here there and.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, could stand at least one of the plants "in context with the fuel production."
There is however "no references to sensitive activities," therefore uranium enrichment or again reconditioning; processes that are necessary to the building of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated to be sure with uranium, that is not enriched.
Yet where the uranium should have come and detached become should where from that later the plutonium for the bomb, gives to these central questions it in any case plausible suppositions.
Unclearly is also whether ruins that could rescue valuable traces, at which three places stored became.
As the hundreds of lorry-loads of the ground would have disappeared, wants to have no one information about that where the debris remained.
That only a salt mine lain few kilometer by el Kibar on the other side the Euphrates al Tibni, that examined Syria 1998 on its fitness as a warehouse for radioactive rubbish, the IAEA counts as unlikely.
The earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had connected it most young an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine Jane's it Intelligence Review with the reactor in.
Receptions out of the orbit show suspect undertook however, that Syria at the three places earth works and removed large containers after the IAEA accesses had demanded.
That can be chance, contributed however hardly in addition to clear the suspicion.
Moreover it is named in diplomat circle, had used the IAEA some months on that to develop a plan for inspections there, that it should permit Syria to preserve contingent military secrets - alone the expense shows how large the interest of the inspectors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this suggestion off.
If western diplomats in Vienna had soothed yet a year ago, would be destroyed the reactor yes, would have therefore the thing no high urgency, brings about US ambassador special inspections so-called Glyn Davies since a couple months into the game, one of the sharpest means that the Viennese has atom authority in order to put through inspections.
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano that these inspections would have to propose has openly am" spoken to be sure already about "an option, for that I in the future, hesitates yet however he.
A high risk in this way lies: To the one, it needs for that a majority in the governor advice of the IAEA, and some of the countries represented 35 there are anything but eager on an escalation.
To the other like a diplomat to consider gives: "What is if they find" at the end nothing at all?
Dear in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work began at its yet nameless administration debut, there is annoyance.
The script wrote it itself, a love story between a woman out of Bosnia and a Serbian man.
One does not know much more about that - however already that passes for unrest.
Stubbornly the rumor, the woman, a Moslem holds itself, would fall in love during the Yugoslavia war in its Serbian rapist.
Bosnian woman associations protested immediately whereupon some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were transferred short-termed to Hungary.
In the meantime the film in Hungary is turned off and in the postal service production, but it still is protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of feminine war victims wrote over the UN fugitive relief agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper now - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN fugitive relief agency.
Diplomatically it is not - it offered weeks ago already once a meeting in Hungary, what that rejected however to the women.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
There had not been would betray love stories in rape camps, and Jolies bearing vis-à-vis the victims its enough over the script.
Your organization recommended according to the UN fugitive relief agency to released Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What did exactly however Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that got to read its script gave after some back and forth a trick permission for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come then nevertheless.
The boy author herself assures, she pursues no political intentions with its film, had gotten used to the work with much effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted show the terrible consequences of the war and give all involved sides a voice.
In the contents, it remains to be sure vague.
So another second Synopsis to the film in the network that sounds then yet rather differently circulates: The loving knew themselves therein already before outbreak of war and meet again when it, a Bosnian Moslem is displaced, into a Serbian camp, in which it works as a watch.
What yet considerably differently "rape victim verknallt sounds itself as the variant in torture servant."
That Jolies film begins actually already before the war - so much is certain.
Let the pressure on it, so Jolie, be "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Now can provide its probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: In that they place the script, how already so many before, illegally into the network.
Nothing like away here
At this evening it runs finally again really round for the Iren.
No trace of Betrübnis.
For that the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too very.
The fans johlen before joy in crashing pure music, they tramp with the feet.
The Bailey pubs in the south Irish Cork quakes, throw because the players of table tennis balls over a three meter distance in beer goblet - and encounter.
"Bierpong" names itself the bizarre spectacle, to win are read there 500 Euro victory premium plus flight tickets after Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drink game and the reserved computer specialist, that does not match really.
To amuse and yet tried itself the 26-year-old at the same time, to distract itself of the boring question, what will bring the future.
On its plan, game joke does not stand in read Vegas, it becomes in January application conversations in New Zealand lead.
"I have an uncomfortable feeling at the same time," says it.
"It is so far away of at home and yet have I no work there."
Nevertheless: Its friend waits in Auckland already for it - "it had jerk, notched its wish job as an Eventmanagerin, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad telescopes home already two of Tanners sought three siblings its good fortune abroad.
Colin its sister Yvonne, a social worker, is has in Sydney, its brother now a place as an IT adviser in London.
The boys go: How in the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Iren will leave the country probably in next time, say experts of the economy institute and social research institute ESRI in Dublin ahead.
Until 2015, they reckon even with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
The prognoses verify themselves, it comes suffered to an emigration wave comparably with that, from the Ireland in the eighty.
After a decade of the upswing, that entailed large prosperity for the Iren, sadness makes itself now again extend.
The economic crisis disconcerts at the same time above all the young, well trained Iren for which it went previously only uphill.
Job loss and social descent seemed in the Boomjahren absurdly.
Everyone was needed, gave money it in the redundance.
In the meantime however three of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times, there is in large numbers letter of emigrant young to the editor that complain: "Everything goes in Ireland the stream down."
"There should be an uprising against politician and bank - however who can, gets lost away and our country therewith an entire generation."
"The last makes then please the light out of."
A gloomy future law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees raise because the government would operate only to be eye wiped and would offer no future outlooks more to the young people.
"You reduce the minimum wages, but it have no strategy, like new jobs created will should," says the 20-Jährige.
It observes how its student fellow of an unpaid practical course to the next climb hand over hand itself.
Your largest worry, says it, would be it to have to emigrate in four years themselves.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
At the same time men such as Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers an all around service to the subject of works abroad.
"For occupation beginner is the work abroad yet a magnificent chance, the first steps on the career leader to make," says the manager.
On its web page, photos surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada show.
The message is clear: Abroad work is no galley service, but rather brings also freedom and joke.
How it feels to construct somewhere else something, Seán O has known' Donovan for a half year.
Because it gave to do nothing for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland more, he works now with 15 Irish colleague on the building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they lift just a fashion house.
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
Its homeland sees O' Donovan in the meantime only rarely, for it makes extra layers in order to be able to pay off the credit for its house home.
"The situation is already a little displaces," says it when it will step after long time for the first time over the threshold of its house.
"I never earn am" money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in that I as good as more.
It laughs transfer somewhat and goes through cooled down rooms.
The small house projects park in a fine residential area with cultivated gardens, in the entrances large, expensive cars.
Jointly with a sister, O bought' Donovan the house for four years ago for 380,000 Euro - 100 percent credit finances.
"It were crazy times, it gave simple money without many questions," says it.
Does it have anxiety that it could go wrong with the credit?
O' Donovan a while considers, pours hot tea after and says: "I have no children whom I must line through and I am young; even if all sloping runs, I can begin" of new.
The building engineer does not like the lament, that he currently often hears.
"No one must hunger - our situation is yet by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," says it.
"A while abroad work, is happen can that not the worst, what - perhaps feel us we through it first as an Iren."
It laughs and tells then of its father, who went in the last large economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, it was again there and life went on in Ireland, very simply."
This thought pleases Cian Tanner.
View the future openly calm and simply once how it somewhere else runs with life.
Does a couple of year work in London it have also already behind itself and why it not should run in New Zealand also well for it and its friend?
A thing is disturbed there however yet, that it in these days proper: the celebration to its 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
It fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Merely too many emotions," it does not say and drinks a large swallow of its beer.
"Farewell, that sounds yet frightening."

The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, so like the support of private businesses.
Crime is a larger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.
To these results, the Latinobarómetro survey, that was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist, came.
This survey regularly is carried out since 1995 and shows so the opinion change in this region up.
Two facts fall in this year's survey of the September and October especially in it eye.
First the good mood in Latin America
And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement strongly increased (s. table 1).
In Peru for example where the economy since 2002 annually around ca. 6% are awake, climbed the number of the democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 on 61% this year.
Also in Mexico where the economy recovers since the strong break-in in the last year again, is to be recognized such a trend.
Yet only the half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, the population richest countries of the region, are convinced democrats, what the regional average sinks (s. charts 2).
Ca. 44% of the questioned explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of its country. Those are soviele such as in the last year, however 25% more than in 2001 (charts 3).
About 34% trust to the congress of its country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond which the last year, show however a clear climb vis-à-vis 2003, (17% and/or 24%).
A decade ago economic crises undermined Latin America the efforts toward more democracy.
That this also during the world economic crisis lasted, lies possibly that the countries of Latin America recovered only a short recession phase of experienced and quickly again.
In addition the arms were caught through a stronger social network.
(According to reports of the UN economy commission for Latin America of this week climbed 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only negligibly on and is this year again around 32% please).
Yet of country by land there are strong mood differences (s. charts 4).
Economy strong Brazil and the popularity of the separating Präsidenten Luiz Inácio Lula there Silva is reflected in a common Fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America where the recession more strongly noticeably was and increased violent crime, is this fewer the case.
First for the second time since survey start, many questioned in Latin America in the crime in its country see a larger problem than in unemployment (s. charts 5).
Ca. 31% state that either it itself or a member of the family in the last year became victim of a crime. Yet vis-à-vis 38% in the last year, the values sank and have reached therefore the lowest state for 1995.
The increasing economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of that privately and the market economy against: ca. 71% of the questioned nationally gave on that the private economy is inevitable for the development, in 2007 were it 56% (s. charts 6).
Ca. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring its country progress, compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly enough this view retained 62% of the questioned in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private economy) although its left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private businesses.
Brazil has had according to 19% of the questioned (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region, followed of the United States (9%, unchanged for last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
The questioned in Mexico and most countries Central Americas on the other hand see the most influential country in the USA whereby this roll in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is received by Venezuela.
A choice defeat
No one had expected that the choices would be perfect on the 28th of November in Haiti.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the choice helpers, that hurried the shaken country to the aid, by far.
Overfilled choice urns, repeatedly delivered voices, polling cards in the gutter, destroyed were polling stations and intimidation only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with hour long delay.
Many Haitianer, of which many had become through the earthquake in January homelandless, prowled in search of a choice.
Some gave in the end very up.
A dozen of presidency candidate, under that some presumed frontrunners, demanded the lifting of the choice results based on an alleged fraud.
In the entire country, it came to partially violent protests.
Nevertheless Edmond designated painted, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, the choice "as right well in many concerns."
These irregularities "make loudly a careful statement of observers of the organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, be like so seriously it also, the process not of necessity invalidly."
In other words, the show goes on.
The choice authority, that nominally the unpopular separating Präsidenten René Préval and its candidate, Jew Célestin, obligated is, will announce the preliminary results on the 7th of December.
The expected run-off election is for January anberaumt.
There is yet hope into the choice.
Both leading opposition candidate, the Rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First lady of me countries Manigat, retracted its initial invalidity complaint.
If Jew Célestin, that at the voters only slight or no approval at all finds, of which Wahlberhörde to the victor of the run-off election explains, this could lead to problems.
Based on the cholera epidemic and the fact that more live than 1 Mio of the earthquake victims still in tents, was feared a slight voter turnout.
At the election day, many Haitianer were prevented from through lacking organization the voting.
Short before choice start were ca. 250,000 identification card that are required to the choice not yet distributed.
Much stands on the game.
The giver countries observe a legitimate, acknowledged government as an important step in the reconstruction Haitis.
The Haitianer itself are the same opinion.
Secretly into the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man, president, Cristina Fernández, learned Argentina a wave of sympathy that drove its popularity rate around 20 points on more than 50% towards the top. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007.
Whether it this helps however in the next year to a re-election, depends therefrom whether the evidently mourning Cristina Fernández willing to compromise is than its deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for that are not unambiguous.
Néstor Kirchner, that also after the choice of its wife the economic policy directed, set up frequently budgets, that the tax collections that did not consider economic growth and the inflation fully.
This permitted it the president couple to issue the extra revenue after own discretion.
On the paper, the Fernández government in the last year lost the majority in the congress.
Yet the opposition is divided and led Kirchners death after a heart attack on the 27th of October to further disputes.
Some regime critics out of the rows of the reigning Peronisten stood behind Cristina Fernández.
Yet after chaotic sessions (with which a parliamentarian one of other into the face struck and other the government of the bribery accused), it did not succeed the congress to dismiss the household for 2011.
"I about that will not discuss," so the president.
The households 2010 applies now also to the next year by what means the president still has more opportunity to issue money after own discretion.
The economy runs be named: it probably becomes this year around up to 9% grow.
The official inflation rate is z. Z. about 11.1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the labor unions - drive the value on almost 30%.
Kirchner that 2003 received the office when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fight to its main goal, and not the inflation decline.
It denied the collaboration with the IMF, tormented the private sector and cleaned the national institute for statistics and census INDEC, that thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte.
Can Fernández hit now a bulkier way?
It called the private economy and the labor union leaders to conversations.
According to and official statements raises in the next year are supposed to be limited to 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentina agricultural products gave the economy a strong buoyancy.
Yet the inflation undermined the growth spurt through a large Devaluation in the year 2002.
Possibly Cristina Fernández would like to connect for this reason Argentina finance economic again to the remainder of the world.
The government encountered beginning of this year an agreement with security proprietors that had rejected the earlier debt funding of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to press club on an agreement with the financiers out of the Paris, which it ca. $6.7 billion owes.
The Kirchners had an examination through the IMF how other plotted rejected usually, always.
Yet in the last month, the Secretary of Commerce Amado Boudou announced that the fund will perform "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks so, as would be this the first step to the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not well known whether Fernández will be politically active after termination of its tenure also without the support through its husband.
If yes, it requires in addition the support of the means layer that has chiefly enough of the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentinians return in March out of its summer vacation, becomes the wave of the Sympatie, that was offered it, faded away be.
If she would like to win a further choice, she must decide whether she quietly cancels many political decisions of its man still and.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan voter approach slowly a narrower connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan of its large brother hold on the far side of the strait?
On the 27th of November, those opened are themselves more than 7.5 Mio voters, 70% of all entitled to vote, in order to select in the five city districts mayor and Stadträte. This is appraised as a wide estimation of the Präsidenten Ma Ying jeou.
Through the construction of pioneering business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, is Ma itself a symbol figure for the relations to the mainland. Its politics persistently changed the relation to the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma existed the test, however only tightly.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) places three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes.
Instead received the democratic progress party (DPP), the one larger independence of Taiwan advocates, almost 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant for Ma problems.
Since its choice two years ago the percentage of votes of its party is around ca. Please 8%.
For the first time, the DPP took in even together with the KMT into the Stadträte.
During the choice, it came to the incidents usual in Taiwan such as truck convoy with Krawallmachern, flags swinging measure moves and only sparse clothed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, that son of Lien Chan and honor chairperson of the KMT a speech held at the eve of the choice on a KMT candidate
As it a man out of the quantity into the face shot. Lien was wounded and a next spectator killed.
Bizarre manner is not clear whether the protection Lien wanted to kill or wanted to enclose a dispute with the candidate.
Independently therefrom the attack has according to Tsai Ing whom, whom leader of the DPP, who impairs choice and the DPP moved into a bad light, what gave the KMT more voices.
Possibly China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkable manner was not brought up for discussion the relations to the mainland.
Instead the candidates debated social dwellings and the creation of jobs over plans to.
The Taiwanese of dear its factual independence and reject China military threat.
For this reason the KMT places its relations to the government in Beijing not gladly into the foreground.
Yet this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti Chinese feelings to very.
It reacted therewith to the new consciousness that Taiwan economy cannot survive without China.
Ma for its part would like to be confirmed let that the majority of the Taiwanese advocates its China politics.
The government in Beijing will pursue further its strategy, Taiwan with economic stimuli into the partnership back attractive.
China sent immediately a negotiator after Taipeh in order to prepare a summit meeting to investment security and medical collaboration.
Certainly it wishes also a political integration. But the most important first.
It waits therewith rather until after the presidential elections 2012.
The DPP newly invented itself in the meantime.
Two years ago it strongly was weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat because of corruption in the prison.
During its presidency of 2000 to 2008, it entered vehemently for the absolute independence.
Yet under Tais regency, a new generation of moderated politicians and the DPP developed fights around the voices of the employed and the youth.
Tsai found large approval as a presidency candidate of the DPP, like Su Tseng chang under Chen.
Your party does now all in order to show that also it is in a position to construct narrow relations to Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea smith as a contact point between the DPP and China. This prefaces however unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai explained publicly that its party would offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas of hasty approach at China.
Chen seems annoys over this change very.
Of its cell out of it, that candidates of the DPP done would have better on that, explained to insist on Taiwan independence.
It requested the pragmatist Su even to forgo the presidency candidacy.
Also without Chens interference, the DPP has trouble to select its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to subject itself an own even analysis.
Mas values are bad, in spite of the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead its campaign without it.
The main reasons for its unpopular-ness seem to be unemployment and the always further scissors between arm and empire.
According to statements of a KMT speaker, he will be reshape cabinet as well as the local arrangements.
The strong appearance of the DPP lets assume that Taiwans advocated only restricted a rapprochement.
Simultaneously most Taiwanese see the economic collaboration with China as unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "gives it already no back more."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was priced surprisingly newcomer of the year in the category
If you on inquiry of a president auftritts, the people will note it.
President Obama itself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear in the ceremony on the occasion of the noble award ceremony 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bass and singer became over rake send would prove nominated for this year's Grammy in the category newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding is since its album "Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene already a celebrated star, appears the nomination a few unusually. Yet it corresponds to the Grammy rules, after which an artist became before publication of the album, with that he in the wide public well known, at most three albums published have may.
Your ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forwards. And with its lively voice and a good feel for pop, radio and Latin Music, can compare one Spalding quietly to Norah Jones 2003, whose large success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination Spaldings at the next.
Furthermore the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer trio in the category instrumental albums was nominated. This favorite of the critics experienced through it a giant success.
To the competitors Iyers, "Moody 4B" of the learned Saxophonisten James belong among other things Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarders John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery united favorite out of New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was priced in the category of contemporary jazz, in which otherwise sooner albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are to be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received large group in the category probably earned attention. It steps therefore at against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and the adventure funny Dave Hollands and be Oktett whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bass as a democratic Bandleader.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The building of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous promise of the local planning committee after a five hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics reproached the project, both to promote the terrorism and traffic obstruction.
Yet according to a statement of the commission of the Wednesday evening, the new religion center corresponds to the local determinations and will become an aesthetic view capture.
"The project becomes of many good people supports - of Christians, Jew, Bahais, and many other," explained Hadi Nael, chairperson of the Islamic center of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As American makes me that proudly."
"It shows, the justice rules."
"It gives only a few opponent," joined he yet thereto.
"You are only very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people" live.
The session began around 18:00 and the discussions for and against the building of the center lasted almost until midnight whereby the voices rather uniformly were distributed among both sides according to press Enterprise.
The debate was led on the web page of the newspaper further.
"It gives No more America," read a commentary.
"It is another planet of the apes, and the statue of liberty lies dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers led, for example in the vicinity of Ground Zero, also in other parts of the country to protests the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on the 11th of September 2001.

It should on that ca. Plot of land of large 17,500 M2 at the Nicolas Road in the vicinity of the Chaparral High School emerge.
Opponents can insert in the city advice of still objection against the project.
Arsen resistant microbe could new life forms on the earth or elsewhere enable
The discovery of a strange bacterium type that can live among other things of Arsen opens new possibilities for new life forms on the earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on the earth, it is in its opinion a sign, that a life also without that previously as absolutely essential considered elements possible is.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It requires for growth either phosphorus or Arsen."
"That makes it to somewhat entirely special, although it almost a type 'strange' life form is," explained Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizonas State University and co-author of the report who will appear on Thursday in the online edition of the periodical to Science.
Previously six head elements became as absolutely essential observed - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
Yet like the scientists found out, are awake the bacterium in the Californian Mono sheet also then yet further if it replaces phosphorus by Arsen.
"There asks one itself yet, what otherwise is yet possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizonas State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestial life because scientists must recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study concerns itself with microbe, that were found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave occasion to far common speculations on the Internet that the report could act life of extraterrestial by the discoveries.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows, that in other planet systems organisms by means of other elements biochemical processes in gear set can and that the 'standard elements', that according to our opinion absolutely absolutely essential are, not unconditionally firmly purported are," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research institute of the open university of Milton Keynes in the united kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, for it shows, that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element through another replaced will can," joined Cockell thereto.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa wolfs Simon of the Astrobiologischen institute of the NASA that led the study selected the Mono sheets based on the high Arsengehalts.
Because Arsen and phosphorus chemically are similar themselves, it supposed that microbes that are stopped both can replace, possibly an element by the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens rests above all on that that it chemically similarly behaves like phosphorus."
"Through it it falls the organisms heavily to distinguish" an element from the other.
"But the difference is so large that Arsen functions differently as a phosphorus. It arrives smears into our biochemical system, where it more or less everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers stopped the bacterium GFAJ-1 of an increasing Arsenkonzentration. It adapted itself and grew.
The microbe are awake to be sure in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in Arsen, shows that an Arsen been based life form naturally can occur, either on the earth or on one of other planet or moon, on which Arsen more frequently occurs.
According to Jamie S. Foster, instructor for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by Arsen, not newly. But previously there was yet no functioning example.
Arsen occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore assumed the science that early life forms used it.
"That gives reason to the acceptance, that life itself also differently develops have can as in the early earth age," so forest that was not member in wolfs Simons research team.
The research projects became of the NASA, that energy ministry and the national health authorities supports.
Remaining stolen display dogs in Compton found
The remaining two of the four display dogs, that were stolen before a Bellflower motel, County sheriff of the Thursday were found according to statements of the Los Angeles.
The four display dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet express Van, in which the animals were accommodated before a Bellflower motel 6 at night, so the authority statements.
Two of the dogs became on Wednesday afternoon discovers, and the last both on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County sheriff it department.
"The good message is: the dogs are well," so Whitmore.
"You are in good condition."
"You were returned" at its lawful owners.
Whitmore made no exact statements to the discovery site of the dogs yet to the circumstances, that led to its discovery.
"The ascertainments run yet."
"We in addition no longer would like to say," explains Whitmore.
"We pursue some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took both dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district bull home in Downey in reception.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and both dogs at different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old would speak, and Didi, a 10 month dog old - were unharmed according to authority statements.
Yet the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of its Japanese owners on the competition, remained until Wednesday evening missed.
Peek and Rickard that live in speech thing were this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba nationally champion hip in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
How Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba-show at other competitions.
South California is a stop on the almost month-long tour of the couple of dog show too dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard in the motel checked in themselves.
They spend the night frequently in motel and park its van before its room window.
They took three further dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with into its motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis remained in the van because it was there cooler.
They let the window a column extend openly so that the dogs had air fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported its vehicle on Tuesday around 6:00 clock as stolen.
Peek promised every, that could give a reference to the Corgis, a find wage. Mikrochips were implanted the animals to the identification.
On Thursday did not be certain yet whether a find wage is paid.
The lion roars again after judicial permission of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulences and uncertainties, MGM got now finally green light for a new beginning.
A bankruptcy judge New York offiziel sanctioned "prepare" on Thursday that Gläuberplan in order to delete the guilt in height of $5 Mrd and to smooth the 86-year-old support business the way for new films and tv show.
In accordance with the statements of the Thursday, the plan fulfills the requests of the US bankruptcy law so that the new start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that founders of Spyglass Entertainment, does nothing stand more in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will project that something studio lost weight as a principal director.
The colleague number becomes of more than 400 on ca. 320 sunk.
For MGM, Chapter 11 steps actually not until power if JPMorgan Chase locked a planned loan of $500 Mio to the financing of the new MGM productions.
In the moment, a consortium of the investment bank that brings in itself $75 Mio leads, the business. The financing should stand until in the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order at the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, that fought with interest payments in height of $300 Mio/years, to help in the solution of its financial problems.
In August the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO with Enron and restructuring expert, that became by its activity in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts well known.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the finance worries MGMs and to pay out the more than 140 Gläuber of the studio, lasted more long than expected.
After month-long discussions, the parties concluded end 2009 to offer the business to the purchase.
Yet the auction dressed only a few bidder and none wanted that of the creditors of demanded $2 Mrd pay.
In the spring these years all of ahead began when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, that became signs after month-long debates and internal disputes the end of October finally of the creditors.
If MGM in the next weeks officially overcame the bankruptcy, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus in height of several millions for its work dollar.
The share for Moelis & Co. that received already $1.2 Mio, amounts to itself on $9.5 million
Cooper, which for the direction of the business monthly $375,000 was paid, receive a "success bonus" of $4 millions
Barber and Birnbaum plan to receive the production in MGM again. This year the studio brought out only a film and generated a year plan with seven or eight films that should come beginning 2012 into the movie theaters.
Furthermore they plan according to two films "the elevated bit" small in Co production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires in addition a separate loan between $265 Mio until $275 Mio for its financial share in both films that should emerge under the administration of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, that ca. 18% of the MGM loan financed has, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment whose largest stockholder he is.
Yet the last negotiations between both business led to no result.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in the balance
This year's favorite under the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed of a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both player eggs can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs so much like five BMX wheels for $99, during the price for a Kinect game of about 10 classic jump rope or ca. 48 doses Play Doh corresponds.
But you can protect your gift budget.
Recently visited I in search of three electronics toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's IT Wholesale club.
Became immediately clear to me that bog law had stepped effective. This year the technology toys are more efficiently and cost simultaneously something less than in the last year.
And although less new toys appear with own web page, Penguin, a wider offer is found on the best known of this type, Webkinz and club.
More and more button cells operated toys come on the market, and many contain again chargeable rechargeable batteries.
Here some recommendations.
(If not differently indicated, are all prices of Toys "R" Us).
Sing-a-ma-hunt are (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) plush figures, so largely like guinea pig, that sing a note, if one presses on its belly.
Once press corresponds can play a note, through multiple pressing one a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-hunt sing in harmony.
Attention: If you began with the pressing once, you can stop no longer.
For a combination out of Gesand and dance, the Dance star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On base that in the last year developed offers Elmo live technology the animatronische doll change game such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blockage controls it the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Your parents complained however about the missing volume control.
If you are a child of the 80, remember certainly Alphie, one of the first computerized trained toys.
Now it is again there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with an entire pile question cards, with which a car trip can become a period, with a know-it-all with car correction function as a teacher.
If you would not like to entrust your Smartphone gladly to your child, are here three independent alternative.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children of 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The games contained on that are equipped is however not as instructive as that on the Leapster explorer ($70, for children by 3 to 12), that of revision first large after Leapfrogs of the Leapster row with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
IXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children of 3 to 7) uses a system for the games and eBOOKS similarly iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, also family photos can be looked at on that.
In the end there is yet Scrabble Flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not more largely than a match box and control an own LED screen.
In the game, it goes therefore to put together the blocks to words before the time expires. It is suitable magnificently for an improvised spell competition.

Police uses in China becomes softer
How an education officer seaweed Shenbin stepped over a municipal place, reviewed its nervous subordinates and delivered at the same time with military Authorität and softened voice commands.
It wanted that its feminine members of the Chengguan - China of guard robust of the municipal order, feared and despises for its arbitrary Razzien and its cliff to the force - impress the spectators.
"Just stand"!
"View straight ahead"!
"Shows them," whispered it them to, "like pretty girls so are"!
Four girls, hardly the teenager age outgrow, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pairs of pants stood tightly.
Pumps black four couples stood in straight row.
Four orderly hats sat perfectly on that with blue knows roved bows of held hair.
"For me see it on the average out of," notes Mr. seaweed derogatory.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments already tried to polish the image of China city inspectors up.
In a city, all new applicants must have a high diploma.
The province Guangdong introduced an illuminating blue uniform instead of the gray green.
Wuhan in means China replaced force by Niederstarren: 2009 circled reports according to 50 officials a not regular set up snack vehicle and stared the operator on until this packed up after a half hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, basically would like to change the image.
Since 2003,13 women have reinforced the municipal police patrols. They were selected special based on its appearance, its good figure and its youth.
They should yield the grobschlächtigen police one, lend feminine aspect.
Yet unfortunately it would hardly succeed also Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad picture, that the Chinese of these city commands have.
With right, so the critics.
Unlike the police these officials may the municipal laws only with the help of of fines or other administrative punishments put through.
Yet the Chinese media show routinely another picture.
In January 2008 thrashed official in the province Hubei a spectator too deaths when this filmed it with its mobile phone at the same time, how they struck down a protest action against a Müllhalde.
In the last year, a training handbook of that was stolen Beijing official and was published on the Internet. Therein is described how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghaier water melon dealer suffered brain injuries after a melee with five officials.
A video-game abounding before force that out of the Internet downloaded will can, shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealer.
"Chengguan makes the government anxiety," lamented the national newspaper China Daily in the last year, after further controversies regarding the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics find the present extension for clearly insufficiently.
When the Distrik sought in October eight feminine recruits per notice, an Editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked the question whether the women would have real tasks or should serve only as an optical diversion.
Probably both.
According to job advertisement, women in the age of 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features" were sought.
They should be above average large - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 customs.
The employment ratio ends with reaching of the 26th year of life.
Loud the official the activity is for women over 25 physical to strenuous.
"The most important is its image," indicated an unbenannter district official in that more or less governments web page Rednet. com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, hangs first of its external appearance off, such as size, weight, features, etc."
Then temperament and "internal qualities" come.
"Feminine Chengguan are like flower vases," it said and joined thereto, "but in addition still have it other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy leader of the city administration of the district, would not like this description beipflichten
Admitted however that in China size specification in job advertisements is not for sex both kinds of unorthodox.
The same applies to uniform features.
Whether that is to be equated with good appearance, is disputed in China.
But people with handicap or physical distortions do not need to apply himself.
"We can here unfortunately no lame or hump-backed utilize," so Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, that on the Baoguang place nearly a cloister patroliert, is 22, has to be apple baked and a probably formed mouth.
You perceived not as sexist that so large value on its appearance put becomes.
Find you "see, I in this uniform sexy out of"? asks it with ironic view.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments on, "we have the task, the image of the city to represent."
According to your statements they do not regret the short attitude because they would have more ambitious career plans to scare away than simple only dealer through the lanes, in order to prevent from it the Geschäftemachen.
Every morning Been concerned that would rove with ca. twelve street dealers, who try to sell on foot or on the bicycle if possible many rolls and Tofugerichte before they are hunted away.
"Mr. Wang, disappear here please."
"We already so often said" that to you! explains Frl. Xu a dealer who was implored on foot and had let at the same time its noodle kitchen of secured on a bicycle carts temporarily in the sting.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous as strenuous.
"It is almost every day that," explains Huang Jing, 20 that in the leisure time sales and marketing being studies.
"All routine."
A reason is, were that the feminine officials that the dealer not how its masculine colleagues may confiscate.
They can threaten offenders only therewith to report it its masculine superior.
That should protect it against public Anfeindungen, which officials in China frequently are stopped.
This year rioted hunderte inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, Chengguan official would have killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan official were injured in the nightly occurrence, were overturned 14 government vehicles or set on fire.
Xindu remained of such force riots previously spared.
Yet unrest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks removes of the quiet Baonguang place, at that the feminine officials this morning patroulierten, met itself over 50 people at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, that was repaired contrary to the directions on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15-minute hesitation, the officials with grim face cleared themselves the way to its vehicles and went with the motorcycle and its owner away.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the masculine would rove, remained back. At the same time it turned around its white name sign in order to remain anonymous.
How its colleague the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
Yet they were not educated therein to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbal before."
"Sometimes however also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most time the people with the dispute catch at."
District attorney will not accuse senator Ensign
District attorneys of the justice ministry absolved became senator John Ensign of the accusations, raised became, that to provide a lobby activity after its affaire with a former choice helper and its attempt, its husband, against it, announced the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
This decision concludes the heaviest right accusation against senator Ensign, the republican out of Nevada. To the scandal, that provided nationwide for headline and transferred its career a mute, it applied as a possible presidency candidate of the republicans to 2012.
How senator announced Ensigns office, he was "highly delighted" over the judgment after the one-year investigation.
The ethics committee of the senate could impose however another Disziplarstrafe.
After statements of Ensigns lawyers, they were informed of the justice ministry about the fact that the investigations were adjusted against senator Ensign and that in this matter no further accusation exist.
The justice ministry did not want to express itself to the case.
The judgment was for many ethics lawyers outside of the justice ministry a surprise. According to your opinion there were sufficient proofs that Ensign neglected the Lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, that openly were put for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave occasion to the supposition that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its choice helpers helped, to lucrative orders in order to buy its being quiet over an affaire with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during a choice campaign Ensigns active as a treasurer.
Ensign received to unite contact political friends in order to provide Hampton work. It received loudly the documents and interrogations for it after the attitude Hamptons lobby work.
Because Hampton was recently yet in Ensigns choice team, it was was allowed to receive it a year long no lobby work for its former employer or the entire senate.
According to statements of ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, that were closely friendly before the affaire, violated, the so-called ban of the revolving door Lobbykratie.
In accordance with the published indication ions "concerns it to all appearances an arrangement and around the offence against the revolving doors regulations," so Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, who specialized in the defense of client, that stand in the visor of the government.
While the justice ministry officially rejected it, to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, said Mr. Fire and other ethics lawyers, the ministry would seem pursues became, including the decision in the past year, fall very carefully in the receiving of political accusations after a multitude of defeats, that of the media with large interest the accusation against the earlier senator Ted Stevens because of false behavior on the part of the district attorney to let.
District attorneys "are obviously fearful," said Melanie Sloan, the chairperson of the union "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization, whose goal the fight of corruption in parliament circle and government circle of the USA is), a group of lawyers, the different accusation against Mr. Ensign before court brought has.
"That means basically, that superior government officials now therefrom go out can, that the laws for it do not count," joined it thereto.
Paul Coggins, head defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, it had received on Monday a phone call of a district attorney and a further at the next day, in which it announced became, that the ministry would bring no charges against its client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the district attorneys in order to convince it that the senator repeated, how its office in an explanation on Wednesday again, "in agreement with the law acted" would have.
Mr. Coggins rejected it, the legal arguments, that it had proposed vis-à-vis the district attorneys, to explain more exact.
"Is not me well there to go into the conversation details between the justice ministry and me. Only so much would be said: We believe to have made the correct decision," said it.
The federal choice commission concluded last month to adjust the ascertainments because of a separate complaint through the ethics group, after the payment one of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents at the Hamptons against the federal choice law offended would have.
The choice commission said, there had not been enough proofs that the money had been something else as a gift.
NV Energy, a large firm in Nevada that supported long time the senator was one of the firms, in whom Mr. Hampton thanks to the aid of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work found.
An e-mail from December 2008 covers that, after the firm Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist helped has, Mr. Ensings rod boss, John Lopez, a conference with Mr. Hampton had, in which it announced it, that it "would knock" at the Ministry of the Interior because of a thing.
Mr. Ensign was moreover with Mr. Hampton and one of other customer out of Nevada, Allegiant Air, to the lunch arranges and asked the transportation minister to arrange a meeting in the name of the airline after these Mr. Hampton for the purpose of lobby work adjusted had.
When last year turned information for the first time about this affair at the public, Mr. apologizes. Ensign at its voters and abandoned its position in the senate where he had stood in the order of the republicans at fourth place.
After it was been noticeable many months no longer, Mr. told. Ensign two weeks ago reporter whom he would strive for a third tenure in the senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer longer the goal of police investigations are, declared its press officer, Jennifer Cooper, whom senator would hope, that the ethics commission would follow very quickly the example of the justice ministry and would adjust its ascertainments.
"Senator Ensign is happy on that, its hard work in the service of the people in Nevada to continue," said it.
Cheshire calling makes aware of Twitter
A half dozen of them typed itself in the Krawallen in the courtoom away.
In the minute tact, they sent over Twitter its reports on ghastly testimony.
At the end, so the defense,, there was more than 140,000 Twitter messages over the process around rape and at beds chained children in a house who rose in flames.
On Thursday the process pursued attentively will become by Steven J. Hayes that was accused, three members a family out of Cheshire, Connecticut to have killed, an official end find if the sentence falls over the death sentence, that expressed the jury.
Yet Mr. Hayes lawyers submitted already proposals in court, that will represent reasons for a calling and that will busy the courts on years.
Reasons provoking is one of that that that it so far spread through the intensive reporting over the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter through average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and one, immediate penetration of rebellious details come would be so that the jury in more inadmissibly manner had been influenced through the public indignation.
This objection could cause the Appelationsgerichte to be concerned with the question whether the new technologies let become new rules in the courtoom necessary.
"So like I it during this process experiences would be right, believe I, that it actual a danger is, if the entrance of the new technologies into the courtoom the of each single on a fair process influences," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes head defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the colonel supreme court, showed past week the proposals per decree shortly and conclusively back when he said, that the new media would become "carefully controlled," and that there would be no proof, that the jury had been driven of passions.
Yet that was not with security yet the last word in this thing.
For decades court objections assessed that the reporting lets arise over famously notorious cases doubt about the fairness of a process.
In its historic decision of 1966, the colonel court of the United States canceled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an Osteopathen out of Cleveland, that his wife should have killed, and said in its decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtoom" because of the new media.
Many one believes that the TV series and the feature film is based "on the flight" on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court objections, which Mr. Later observe Hayes convictions a half century, could follow the argument that new rules became necessary, around the communication ways out of the courtoom, that at present the if Dr. Sheppard yet unimaginable were, to regulate.
"It gives a good reason, over the influence of the new media in processes, that of a wide public pursues become, disturbed to be," said John J. Donohue III, professor at the Stanford Law School, that the death penalty in Connecticut examined. According to its report it arbitrarily is imposed.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea, more fairly could make that the restriction of an immediate communication out of the courtoom the processes.
The Twitter matter is only one of many, that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes represent in order to discuss on years and therefore a conviction out hesitant.
The defenders maintain for example also that Mr. Hayes already before convicted been be could when judge Blue had not permitted them to test the reactions of potential Juroren in that one showed them during the Jurorenauswahl ghastly crime scene photos.
Some of the Juroren said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and its Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled it with abhorrence.
The defenders say, they would question argue also the constitution temperance of the death penalty constitution, and that the judge had exchanged falsely a Juror, that a critic of the district attorney's office had been, and that he would have exerted more inadmissibly manner pressure on the judgment, than he the unorthodox decision encountered had to place the jury over the weekend freely.
The Juroren were not isolated.
Yet its arguments over the influence of the detailed reporting over the process the largest interest stretches perhaps on.
In a judgment attack, that submitted it past month, they assessed that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and was discussed during the campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate of the candidates.
They argued that the new media would have newly kindles continuously the flames of the emotions over the case.
"One every day press of the Medienpiepser, cameras and reporter outside of the courtoom," wrote the lawyers, "still has one previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide not yet experiences."
Your focal point on the reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews said some journalists, that the statement, these direct messages would be aufwieglerischer as reports, that are returned slower, a technology hostile view would be, that would become impoverished the reporting over future processes.
Yet some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would be confronted often with the argument, social and technical variations needed the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this statement.
In its objection, they had references to the decision of the colonel court of 1966, in which the conviction was canceled by Dr. Sheppard based on the reporting, and made clearly that the new media require new rules.
"These cases," wrote it, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign at insult words and negativity, this week broke out little courtesy in Washington.
Is it that grandmas of a real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of the illusion before one returns quickly again to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and tip of the congress brought itself no breakthrough in the large questions, with that one during that so-called. "Lame duck session," that session had to busy at the end of a government period, in which no more decisions are encountered.
After all that, what one hears, was to be reigned it neither a polite discussion between two different sides another notice of its divided responsibility, but rather sooner an empty episode one Punktesammelns party laughed.
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday likewise was civilized, in spite of which political differences that exist between the members further.
It seems to be clearly that a narrow interaction lets emerge over a period of months a mutual respect, that disguises the ideological crevice, that further the members separates from one another.
That is hardly enough in order to maintain, would be opened a new era of the cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other sign of the cooperations and willingness to compromise calls for while one himself tries to weigh the boundaries of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore the meeting on Tuesday itself and its estimation were limited through the participants to a minimum at demands or accusation.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep when that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, that prevailed in the past two years.
Equal whether it concerns taxes, contributions, health or Anwartschaften, both sides are removed for miles and miles from one another.
In the end the November choice agreed Washington at least for short time mild.
"No question, the intonation has itself changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who works now for the "Ethics and Public Policy center."
"That is unavoidable after choices.
Choices awake party would laugh passions that die out again.
And that is well so."
In some questions, especially in which, that on the order of the day of the "lame session" duck stand, have republican and democrats hardly another choice to find when a solution."
Bushs tax declines end end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way, would receive around some or quite everyone too, would be it now temporary or durable.
Just as a compromise is to be expected regarding the increased unemployment compensations if also only, because the republicans cannot afford it, that one believes, the favored tax declines for the empires while they deny unemployed workers a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism climbed, duck ratify can himself that one in these questions during the "lame session" of some and simultaneously also the new START contract.
Yet William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution warns, duck lead must that a successful collaboration in urgent questions of the lame session" not compelling to a durable collaboration of the parties if the new 112th congress is convened in January.
Instead, so says it, is a phase of the disagreeing more probable, perhaps even indispensably.
"After the things, that done will must, done are, becomes this short-term psychology in confrontation turn over," said it.
Wehner is leads also sceptically - and this scepticism becomes of many divided - the courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see much, what of today at until 2012 happens, when before battle, or shadow-boxing, for the head event of 2012," said it.
The reasons for this have much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house to do and with the tea parties voters, who were serviceable its development.
How concerned the republican leaders like to be also about that, that they must know to highly poker, it, that they must try, its promises to sink the editions of the government and to set, to keep the health reform except power.
These party lines become already in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission clear, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes as well as the raising of the retirement age and the sinking of the country editions.
One of the most difficult jobs received the deputy chairpeople Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles in Washington and have, pressed in accordance with its own estimation, so very on that to set the deficit question on the public order of the day that these can be ignored no longer.
But they need within the commission of 14 the 18 voices in order to make its plan to the recommendation official and it fight very in order to come also only into the vicinity of this number.
The largest resistance is found in the selected representatives of the group because in finance questions, at least today, only little latitude or little sympathy is for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the white house and the republicans in the congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party collisions if the republicans Obama followed with respect to the country household, that demand taxes and the health system, later then of a phase of larger zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What lead becomes to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, in spite of the bias of the current choice, that majority of the Americans yet always wishes for, that both parties together work.
If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened to 1995, both parties must pay attention painstakingly to the public reaction.
He, who is convicted also always for losing, will must change the course and seek the compromise.
That likes to be in the deed an optimistic visibility manner.
Bias and polarization are today larger than in the middle of the '1990's, and they seem a larger ideological crevice between Obama and the congresses republicans to its as at that time between President Bill Clinton and the republicans.
Simultaneously the activists of both parties 2010 see as a pure prologue for a choice by far more long-range at consequence 2012.
So seen likes the courtesy, that is displayed this week, of many Americans welcomes become.
Yet it will require very much on both sides more effort to find a joint denominator in the questions, that separate both as always from one another.
Oozed US document portrays Moscow as a harbor of the corruption
The inspection of the city lies gives in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it a part of the bribes and the protection money that gathers it, at the Kremlin further. So the American message in Russia in a memo reported in February.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection moneys so that they can hold its expensive standard of living in Moscow, is named it.
They gather money not only of legitimate businesses, but rather also of organized criminal volumes.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what prime minister Vladimir Putin as "vertical of the authority" designates has - takes itself its part of the money that the leaders hikes towards the top.
The memo, that was sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle after Washington, was published on Tuesday of WikiLeaks on its homepages.
The memo is based on sources, whose names were revised.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov of yet Moscow mayor was, and it accuses it the corruption.
It was fired in October of Präsident Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof that in the meantime cleaned up become would be.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who possesses a well known construction company rejected over years of corruption accusations again and again, and it won numerous slander complaints against such accusations.
In September it explained a Russian television station when it was asked about a documentation, that suggests, it would be corrupt: "It is displaced, it is dirty, it is dirty."
> An incredibly large number at Russians believe that its company is corrupt. Surveys yielded that.
But it is unusually that, how in the report of the ambassador happen, single people named become, and it is unheard that this happens through a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the crime led in addition, disturbed designate that some it as"" and come to the end, acts that the government sooner like a Kleptokrat than a government," so the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy covers a" kryshna" (a concept out of the world of the criminal / the mafia, what literal "roof" or protection means), that the police, the state security (FSB), the service regulatory agency (MVD) and the office of the district attorney just as like through the entire moscovite government bureaucracy.
Specialists discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at uppermost place."
"FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second step."
"Finally the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the lowest step."
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups in many areas close a space, because the city no aid at all offers."
The report says further that the FSB money collects of the largest firms and arrests the businessmen small the police.
A source, is named is, "explained, that Moscow shopkeeper understand, that it best is, the protection of the MVD and FSB to get (and not of the organized crime), there it not only more weapons, resources and power have as the criminals, but rather also because it through the law protected become."
"For this reason the protection is asked through criminal gears no longer so like earlier."
The memo notes that, while the gathering of the moneys is comprehensively, the protection of even very modest be be arrested no; even that that pay, sometimes.
That that do not pay find very quickly closed its business before - based on the on or other pretext.
Medvedev spoke repeatedly about that to fight the corruption, however simultaneously noticed in that it made only little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men, that with with suitcases, that were probably full with money, in which Kremlin go.
"In its battle against the corruption must Medvedev itself on the bureaucrats leave," said Georgy Satarov, director of in that, a moscovite expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia exists" no longer.
Without politician, without an opposition, without a separation of the forces, says he, is corruption unavoidable.
Nationwide, appreciates in that, costs the corruptions Russia more than $ 300 billions per year.
The country ranked on place of 154 a newer investigation to the global perception of the corruption through the non-governmental organization Transparence internationally (countries become of "at that least corrupt" "most corrupt" itemized).
The uncovering of the memo of the American message which happened after moscovite time spätabends, will release be can with security displeasing within the Russian government although, because Luzhkov can be accused for the mistakes of Moscow, it for the Kremlin also a possibility to maintain that one would solve the problems.
Putin maintained in an interview with Larry King for CNN that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted named furiously on the uncovering, that American diplomats it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is, that it around our interaction goes, that an important factor of the domestic policy in this country is," said it.
In order but around to be honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and on so unethische type and manner, know you."
Khmer rouge veterans to the confrontation with the past forced
In a weakly illuminated, betonierten classroom with dirty and peeling off walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds one of the man, who built it, at the later Khmer rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Every here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he has herself around its people worried," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer rouge domination well known as "the butcher," remains the commander in this remote former Khmer rouge stronghold in the northwest Kambodschas popularly where he constructed hospitals and bridges, that infrastructure developed and yet always live where thousands of former soldiers.
Yet this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer rouges vis-à-vis the government, long-time followers in Anlong Veng are demanded.
In April a local truth forum and reconciliation forum permitted the victims the public confrontation with the people that supported once the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book that for the first time children former soldiers tells the story of the Khmer rouges.
And in July a partnership tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas convicted for the first time a former member of the Khmer rouges when it convicted the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better well known as a Duch, to 35 years prison.
With every of these developments, the anxiety grew under the Khmer rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, impeded its efforts toward reconciliation and Reintegration into the company Kambodschas.
"It gives yet always rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer rouges, but it have no power, anything to do," said Chhang Youk, leader of the documentation center of Kambodschas, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For it, life was glorious under the Khmer rouges, but the regime became" a symbol of the squall.
"It splits even families."
During the Khmer rouge domination in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were executed approximately or died it at illnesses, revision or before hunger.
When the Vietnamese occurred and 1979 fell the poles Pot Ied government, the remnants of the regime implored and be military at the boundary Kambodschas to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated, unrest.
As a pole Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerilla war of its basis in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia led, pulled Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng up to.
But middle of the '1990's when a peace agreement 1993 promoted by the UN led to the first democratic choices of the country to overflow began large groups of Khmer rouge fighters, to the government, what led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pole Pot died was arrested 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok that had not given way, 1999 of government powers in the Dangrek Mountains.
It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh where it waited for its process.
When its patrons more long protected it no longer, most former Khmer rouges fighters fled retained the movement in nostalgic memory into the wearing down poverty of the rural Kambodschas and many.
Also if some retained few elitist officials of the Khmer rouges its local government posts, because they laid down its weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only very few of the capitulation profits," said Sok Leang of the center for justice and reconciliation, that holds throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"You are anchored into the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"You grew without each occupation white to."
So Lim, 55 years, that 1974 had joined as a teenager of the Rhmer rouges, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he established himself 1998 in order to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer rouges was good," said it.
"Ta Mok gave" everyone something to eat.
"But now life is heavy because we must" attend to us even.
The running Khmer rouge tribunal roused also here worries.
Beginning next year will try the court, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another earlier Khmer rouge minister to place before court.
The order of the court is not is said it that to convict old leader and that, that are responsible main for the horror deeds,, but it whether it will pursue over these four cases out further deeds.
That contributed few in addition to soften the anxieties in Anlong Veng.
Current medium speculations have on in the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated was, were was that during the Khmer rouge domination in the late '1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey.
It had told 2007 delegate of the documentation center of Cambodia, it had led the building of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project with which cable would send of slave laborers probably died.
At a hot evening returned in the Chaem of the work on the fields to its wood house at a dirty street outside of of Anlong Veng.
Shadow long as the sun on the withered grass threw off leaned it in the Chaem to discuss its past in the Khmer rouges.
If the court should summon it, she would refuse to go, said it.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," said it.
There "were no more pursuits, war" would be here.
Prime minister Hun Sen, that 1878 of the Khmer rouges is implored, warned moreover repeatedly before that that the situation would become unsteady, would accuse the court more suspect although experts and historian discuss this.
"Cambodia must a hole dig and the past bury," said it.
But the confrontation with the past is that what must do Cambodia in order to be able to go forwards, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering of the broken pieces," said it.
"It is our duty to set these broken parts together so that how everything can" understand.
The center created the first school book approved by the government over the Khmer rouges, the 75seitige "story of the democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as a supplement to the history book for the High School of the development ministry, that contains less than four sides over the Khmer rouges.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only few over the Khmer rouges, in spite of the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of its story.
But his parents reacted sceptically when it brought the book home in order to read it.
"My family leans many parts of the beech and the court from," said it.
"You are distrustful because they are not certain, like many people of the court convicted become."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicates, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain gradually influence," said it.
Yet always a powerful attraction possesses the Khmer rouges here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains leads an of bushes more overgrow and with plastic rubbish filthy way to a rectangle of black soot, covers with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pole Pots body had been burned here after its death 1998 on a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone salesman at the roadside, said would know, it not much over the man, who had been burned here.
"But it has a strong spirit and many people here concern to it to pray," said it.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later at the day wanted it to pole Pots of last quiet site go where it will discard a shrub of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings its good fortune.
White Russia is therewith agreed, not further weapon capable uranium to collect
In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign to the worldwide security of nuclear material, the government of White Russia announced on Wednesday that one will gather no longer more long highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint Statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the white Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince White Russia, to gather no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed reached last spring a hurdle to have.
Yet official of the US government of told the washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreement with White Russia encountered became in order to remove from 187 pounds uranium weapon capable a white Russian research institute.
The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material - according to an official colleague, who remains based on the sensitivity of the subject anonymous, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas, that had excluded White Russia to "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" of the April.
And it was obvious good enough in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012.
"I really was enthused of the fact that they want" a seat in the nuclear security summit (of 2012).
"That proves me, that it functions," said Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security, a group to the support of the nuclear security.
Clinton named the agreement "a very important, important step" of White Russia.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then the US government helped six countries to become its highly enriched uranium loose.
White Russia will be the seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
Präsident Alexander Lukashenko explained the white Russian to security summit nuclear at present by Obamas that the nation never will abandon its uranium.
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, what basic weapon capable is, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"That is our raw material... We will make from that no dirty bombs and will sell we it no one."
"We use is it exclusively for research purposes, that all."
White Russia approached nevertheless a few months ago the USA on when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the uranium of White Russia in October, especially was complicated because the material easily had contaminated, say official.
It became loading, the more into a special train than 1,300 miles a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second start was concluded on Monday and was carried out loudly the official per airplane.
The US government pays for these striving $ 14 million whereby a large part of the money flows into the white Russian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinates and voted, around confidence to construct" that led to the agreement, which became signs of Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy ministry who works at the global danger reduction.
The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies appreciates that White Russia had this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen of uranium as well as hundreds of pound at highly enriched uranium.
White Russia wants to be dissolve according to the joint agreement warehouse until 2012.
The relations between White Russia and the USA were for years tense, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregards of the human rights.
But the Statement of the Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global matters of security welcome being named, announce the United States of America and White Russia, that an increased respect before the democracy and the human rights in White Russia a central subject in the improvement of the bilateral relations remains and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," explains it.
No objections of the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections against the CIAS flights with Taliban and al-Qaida-prisoner over Spanish country zone after Guantánamo how out of a telegram of the ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid follows.
That of Wikileaks enhüllten and at the daily newspapers "els País" (per cable) reflect that forwarded documents. It is added that the former deputy head of the government María Teresa Fernández demanded de la Vega, that Spanish government become should informed, "around to prove, that foreign airplanes, that Spain fly over, appropriate supervised become."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe, in that the aid to menschenrechtsverachtenden practices in one addressing informally countries, under that also Spain, accused became, discussed itself the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy head of the government admitted, the report of the advice "would have Zapatero in that to one side of encountered" and strengthened, Spain has nothing to conceal in this matter.
"De la Vega unterstrich, Spain has no objections against the secret service flights over Spanish country zone."
Aguirre does not report "you simply only informed would like to become," around "unprepared surprised to become," per cable.
Also the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, referred the ambassador on that that the Spanish government of "this matter wanted give no large attention, although the government would have only little influence possibilities, because these would lie" in the hands of the judges.
The district attorney Vicente González gave for its part in January 2007 of the message to understand that he would not become to apply for block the judicial initiative, the Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish secret service headquarters (CNI) and the Minister of Defense over the CIAS flights.
"These reports contain nothing information onerous or sensitive," explained the ambassador after a conversation with the district attorney.
Nevertheless the USA was over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish district attorney and the German district attorneys" more concerned than over the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the defense ministry.
"This coordination between independent lower searchers becomes our exertions the discrete handling between governments verkomplizieren," laments Aguirre.
In a lunch in March 2007, at which the ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Secretary of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, commented on more latter that "although the Spanish judges insanely strongly on its independence considered would be and that would do, what it for appropriate hold," he had given its colleagues directions, "inflated rhetorical commentaries to avoid, around the tension abflauen to let."
The ambassador expressed also its apprehension about the procedure of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of its in general per American bearing teaches our experience us, that the PP not on that doubt would become, out of a reference, that the government Zapateros actions of the USA, that as a possible person breach of the law designed become could, tolerates or intentionally ignores would have, capital strike becomes, also if these uncovering itself negatively for the government of the USA effect could," lifts it forth.
The child murderer stood, it would have itself on the Internet over the "toil" of the motherhood burdens.
The young woman spoke about the child when this already dead was and it had a blog: "Terror on Galicien type"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this surname, that it leads of small on, it holds contact with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province La Coruña in which it was born.
The communications are out of the year 2008.
In order to understand this, one must know its love life, that reconstructs the daily newspaper ABC on the base of testimony of its family members.

Already shortly on that it went in another relation.
That selected was Alberto, a young man out of Lousame, a neighbor community.
With it, it lived together long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went on the Balearen, in order to look around itself on the labor market, the small remained at its partner, who accompanied it even a week long after Palma.
But out of the contents of its messages can be closed that its romantic attachment broke and separated it itself.
It is in March 2008 alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I am" come to the working.
"As I it that announced, found notices he it good, but now he naturally, what means it to be with the boy the entire day long alone and to not to be free, to be able to let do and, what he would like."
Later it mentions a communication, that received it just on the mobile phone: "I would like that you return this month or let approach me an address, at that I you the boy send can."
It laments herself: "If it does not please it, that I let the boy at my mother, I pick up it if I am" back.
In May it speaks about the return into its village: I go "this week there there, but I will remain only to that 19th there because I must imagine at that 20th to a work, if I do not want" lose that.
It explains that it brings its first-born, if all goes well.
"It will be in that, with which it must be, that is, with me. In life, I never become it again with someone except at my mother let," a doubtful intention if one takes its bad relation into consideration.
In July there is a further mail.
When it writes this, is assumed that the boy, who came on that 1st the month on the island and was murdered nominally on that 10th, is dead.
"On the one hand César is not satisfied, on the other hand."
"On the one hand it is pleases with me and the place it a little, but on the other hand it must go" every day into the school.
It speaks about a move to Majorca.
"There it (the boy) will visit a summer course, have I less editions for the child girl."
At that 17.: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César that asks me when you come."
"Alberto says had sent, it any videos on the e-mail to me. If you see if it wants, it finds me, such a manure."
On that 30th yet one: "The boy it goes good. It goes into a summer course to learn around catalan."
Of Víctor, its present partner, it gives one: "It shoots me money before."
On the Internet, in Anime- and Mangablogs, there are communications of its.
It had herself even an own blog in MySpace that is blocked now, and in that it "Muki that named Gefängnisentlasserin."
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ."
To have the last man who lived together with it, a sworn in hunt overseer, declared remorse because he indebted would feel.
It cannot grasp that everything happened, because it had not told it, that it would be single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday of the center for court prisoner on Menorca into the province prison of Palma.
The duty defender, Carlos Maceda, explained, she could not remember the flow of the circumstance, "and it would have not the intention had, the small damage to add."
Before it had stood to be sure, had drowned César in the bathtub and to have stowed its corpse in a suitcase.
Defense and district attorney's office applied for a psychiatric expert opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress in addition and PSC lost 9
With the results of the 28th of November, the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a decisive role
After the important agreeing increase and delegate increase in the last regional choices, the PP arranges its view already on the parliament choices - preferred or not. Your expectations are more than positive, for the number of votes, that this party obtains in these choices, that is normally doubly as high as in the choices in Katalonien.
So the catalan People's Party received 610,473 voices in the parliament choices of 2008 while this figure amounted to only 316,222 in the regional choices in 2006.
At the last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 voices.
If this climbing tendency - result of the detour of the percentage of votes the PSC and the tie of the constituency of the PP - should stop, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliament choices the PPC of 8 could climb on 12 congresswomen, during also CiU four (it has now 10) win in addition and lose would become the PSC at least 9 delegates (of 25).
These calculations cover the fundamental meaning Kataloniens for PP and PSOE.
In accordance with the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a delegate - presently has it three -while ICV hold its delegate or could win in addition one.
If the choice calendar should be retained however, the next appointment with the community choices falls into the May 2011: Also then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the scales in order to prepare the socialistic predominance an end, and to be sure in four province capitals and with its majority in the city advice Barcelonas, one of the city administrations with the largest household: 661 million Euro for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree therein that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists can obtain fall back neither a majority yet on its traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the republican debacle, it is not misleading that this party will lose its representation in the local council Barcelonas, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the voices.
The PP indicated on the other hand an increase of its percentage of votes in the four province capitals and could become the decisive power in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas reversal. There they had reigned before the present mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
E Lérida lies the PP only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations to Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign met it repeatedly.
Also in other important places, like for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or regrets the People's Party was able to indicate an important increase.
Presently the PP in 34 city administrations Kataloniens is represented and strives the development of lists in so many places such as possible on.
Als concerned the catalan cell Qaida cable would send by passports
Except the seven arrests in Barcelona, there was three further in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis arrested by the policemen the secret office the police Barcelonas and the Nigerian formed that of Thailand out of driven dschihadistische cell, the different als Qaida groups, under that the "movement to the release of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e Taiba" (Let) - was latter author of the attempts in Bombay, the 2008,106 dead demanded - with passports furnished.
The Spanish Secretary of the Interior shows these investigations a large meaning, that so far goes, that he assures, with the "operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus would be "weakened" become al Qaidas worldwide and "therefore its action capacity."
The researchers assume cable would send sent became, that in the two years, in which the cell in Katalonien was active, by passports to Thailand where these were falsified and were sent after that at the groups, out of which the criminal galaxy al Qaida puts together itself, so that its "fighter" were able to exceed punishmentless the boundaries More european and other western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only of the dschihadistischen network that was active in Europe. Therefore also other European police units assisted except the Thai investigation organs with the investigations. It is not to be excluded that it will come in the field of the EU in the next days to similar attempts such as that, that was carried out at the past Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade became arrested), a further was carried out in Thailand, with which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar asked and Zeeshan Ehsan asked, as well as were arrested the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had led of Bangkok out of the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
Especially tourist of passports stole the catalan network - a part therefrom was in 2009 to nothing made become - in accordance with the specification of the so named "international Islamic front."
That meant that the documents are issued on the name of men in the age of 25 to 45 years and yet several years be valid must; they were allowed to show no visa stamps.
In investigation circle is underlined that until now no connections between that in Katalonien arrested and the attempt in Bombay proved become could, although the author of this attempt, "Laschkar e Taiba" was, one of the receiver groups of that in Spain of stolen and thereupon in Thailand falsified passports.
Nevertheless should be remembered on that that some days had been fizzled out before the attempt by Katalonien out of by means of a money transfer business several thousand dollars, that became into the purchase of Prepaid cards for mobile phones "invested," that later by the members of the "command," who prepared life of 106 people an end, used became.
The police seized an extensive documentation.
PP demands of Mas an adjournment of the tax agreement
The chairperson of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, took yesterday the opportunity aware to produce Artur Mas personally its conditions to the support of its assumption of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ of that already during the campaign of placed and let itself summarize with the priority-ness of the economic again upswing and the omission of regionalistischen independence adventures, how a finance balance agreement, that the regionalistische leader wants to propose on the highpoint of its mandate.
The chairperson of the catalan People's Party turned won had with the security to Artur Mas, that its the 18 delegates lent, that it at the last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficiently in order to feel indispensably. For the candidate of the middle class regionalistischen party CiU is directed on that that at least one of the opposition parties in the voting in its assumption of office of the voice abstains.
The future alliances, that want to go in the Regionalisten in the coming parliament choices in the congress, depend on a possible Entente with the PP. The conversations, that Mas leads at present with the remaining party chiefs, revolve to be sure around Katalonien.
What the chairman of the party of the PPC concerns, demands this that to the support of the assumption of office "all discourses, that concern" the sovereignty and independence Kataloniens as well as an agreement on wants to subject the party chief of CiU even a referendum to the finance balance between country and the autonomous region - similarly in the Basque country - and that, behind engaged become.
Both political leaders is mean that they want to make the billowed political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and want to abolish the inheritance tax and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations to the assumption of office of Mas busy itself on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - the opposition one hard announced - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today it will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old nursing home strengthens that the deaths are not to be attributed to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not exclude that its caretaker killed over eleven older people
The responsibles of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they laid out, which damage had added the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker, the person at least eleven old during its work, for which he was responsible, killed had - to the arrangement.
The leader of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in accompaniment of its lawyer, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) accuse," but "the right and our liability duty force to suppose us in addition the process and the civil law liability."
The arrangement must accept not only a social loss of face because it had assessed the criminal actions of the caretaker not on time, but rather pay now also a high compensation sum, that is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime is due to August 2009 and that it had murdered since then further.
The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - because he assumed, that no physician personally had examined the deceased, but rather the formalities by telephone were completed based on its age and illnesses.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point plainly and explained, been could" that "staying away measures keinerzeit the reason for the occurrences its.
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the lawsuit no indication ions for careless actions another person would give" as the accused.
That already as a "death angel" baptized confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and explained, commits the first crime on the 29th of August 2009 and to have murdered one and a half months later the second old lady.
In this case, it killed with an overdose insulin, in the difference for first crime, with which it had dispensed a mixture out of different sedatives.
The leader of La Caritat explained, the access of the personnel to the medicines is to be controlled only heavily.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the caretaker in six of nine committed crimes in order to free the patients with death of its suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will lay out whether Vila lies and selected a less cruel death for its first victims actually or whether it burned out this from within, in that it dispensed them pale lye, how it had done it according to admission with three women, whom it murdered between that 12th and 17th of October.
In La Caritat, one gives the statements of the caretaker no belief, not once, what concerns the amount of the stood murders, that could be thoroughly more. This attitude is justified therewith that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it would make no sense to change its procedure after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say, they made available itself it for this reason and clarification of the range of these occurrences the justice to the.
Drohgebärden of the European central bank (EZB)
The investors of reacted yesterday sharply on the threat of the EZB Präsidenten Trichet, that warned, "the markets should our reaction fortune do not underestimate."
The risk impacts of the Euro Peripheriländer dramatically climbed and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%.
Nevertheless we should not the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the Euro gained hardly at points, what causes to the worry, underestimate.
The events of yesterday are collapses recovered typically for an illiquiden market, that in the mass, in that it again, to be sure as a result of the closing shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose yet long its anxiety.
Today a month ago the European central bank requested us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen annulled according to what the EZB must make tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably yet some times in the future, a backing down.
The German Federal Bank demanded the Beendung of the plan to the purchase of country guilt because these would be ineffectual, as well as the lifting of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access should be retained it.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the present liquidity measures are extended "at least until March" and the quarterly announcements with unlimited access are retained at the end-of-quarter to the guarantee of the liquidity until at least June.
We expect also that the program is continued to the purchase of bond and a strengthening signal will issue.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, are thrown back the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday again and if halstarrig is persisted on that to turn back that we our liquidity measures, can help us only God!
Just as as in the EZB session in May, with which the bank strengthened to not to take the purchase of country guilt paper into consideration and the markets thereupon collapsed, could repeat itself this story tomorrow.
The EZB must be trustworthy and persistent.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday it said to have bought already much wherewith it provoked a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year country title in Portugal was rather weak.
The national fortune administration issued only 500 million to 5.28%, vis-à-vis 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction.
Nevertheless the interests rates in Portugal fell around 30 basis points in the entire curve and reflected therewith a perception variation of the markets after the words Trichets against.
In Ireland, the numbers of the guilt hole were published of Allied and bank of Ireland.
The sum becomes on approximately 10 000 million short-termed and possible further 15,000 appreciated. There is time until February in order to procure private capital or these banks be nationalized.
Although Ireland lost its credibility totally, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers in the frame of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to diminish the uncertainty.
To be sure the government must receive the parliamentary approval to its new budget at the coming Tuesday. Because it does not control yet always the sufficient support, Ireland is also further a source of the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel more moderately formed its discourse with regard to the summit of the heads of state and the government on the 14th of December. There political unit is asked in order to show that we play jointly that the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish district president introduced yesterday the measure plan, that is supposed to be dismissed on Friday by the cabinet council.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as in the financial institutions, dismantling of the country deficit, liberalization, denationalization and work procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange gained around 4.5 percent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges.
In comparison with the February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we profit from the surprise effect.
Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year government bond that will pull utility out of the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, that will remove all doubts about our debt funding capacity.
For Spain, the application of an auxiliary plan would be an even sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billions of Euro to the decree, three times so much like in March. The interests rates are extremely expensive and the access to the markets would become without notice closed.
Nevertheless our strategy should correspond Cäsars woman to the motto: "Now not only that counts be, but rather also the certificate."
We create only courage, that!
The chairman of the board of owls contests on proposal of its children the company meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies owls and el Enebro, flaut not off.
David Álvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, will contest the company meeting of el Enebro, that will take place on proposal of five of its seven children on that 16th, because he considers it to be "absolutely void." Its children will try to received a majority, in order to control the administration organs of the firm - proprietor of the vineyard ground gas Vega Sicilia -.
The legal measures prepare David Álvarez and its children Jesús David and María José for a new justice chapter in its dispute around the inspection of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem ready to be, to give way in its lawsuit around the inspection of the organs of el Enebro.
Out of the supervisory board, it was expelled here of five of its seven children. These appointed itself on the stockholder meeting of the 18th of January of this year, that is registered in the trade index already as contested, to administration councilors.
The company meeting of el Enebro, that was convened by the judge of the trade court number 2 by Madrid for that 16th, Álvarez released a new thunderclap in the lap of the family.
The invocation of the judge to the Anberaumung of the meeting is the single juristic way that the summoning of the company meeting guarantees.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz becomes of David Álvarez as a "despairing means of the applicant - its five children - displayed, around by means of legal tip resourcefulnesss, deceitful wheelings and dealings and right abuse that for void declared meeting of the 18th of January acknowledge to let" how official speakers explain.
This argumentation is the base for the attack of the meeting afterwards in order to explain it as "absolutely void."
The same protagonists who wrap themselves into discrete being quiet, tried in June already unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on judicial way.
In el Enebro - fortune company and proprietor of ground gas Vega Sicilia, next to other assets - control David Álvarez' seven children 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand the founder of the service group demands according to family protocols the utilization right over 51% of the capital.
That is has the actual background of the thing to decide over that of the judge in the hearing to the treatment of the attack complaint, for which yet no date was determined.
Speech formed into a ball wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The vehicles are improved with a software in real time.
Since speech formed into a ball 2004 into the world of the formula 1 penetrated, is stamped its story in this selected universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Originally no one gave the novice notice and in spite of its steeply climbing development during the last seasons set all in the sprint in the last November on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the capacities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the motor of Renault, is the "secret weapon," that the Multi Siemens speech formed into a ball into the hands put, and so that a victor team created, to the legend become.
In reality concerns a high-performance software to the simulation of processes, that the German business 2007 too purposes, that don't have to do with car race, on which market brought.
This information technology program designated as PLM was used for the development by assembly chains in factories in the entire world, energy works and high-precision instruments.
Planned a loyal reproduction and/or simulation of a product or process becomes before this actually is constructed in order to avoid so mistake and superfluous costs.
PLM has the development of the cameras of Canon for which airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous utility vehicles of Nissan eases.
Siegfried soot worm, leader of the industry department of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the formula 1 - factory speech formed into a ball "in few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements, that are assessed on the races and in the tests, sketch and carry out can.
Soot worm carries out that 1992 in the race stables on the average ten technicians worked, who were able to introduce at most three or four improvements in a season.
In speech form into a ball are team 180 highly qualified young people today busies. With high-performance EDP plants, they carry out analyses and all possible changes at the race vehicle.
The Siemens manager explained, who would be PLM software in a position, all components of the race vehicles of speech formed into a ball to analyze and to improve, with exception of the motor, for which excluding Renault responsibly explains itself.
The materials, that fuel, that changed become aerodynamics and the security elements.
The changes can be transmitted thanks to progressive production plants and Hightech Autoklaven within less than 24 hours by the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality.
The single boundary, that is set this crazy technical Perfektionismus, are the 40 million dollars, that may issue a formula 1 - team for its races in a season.
Speech formed into a ball has its Hightech factory for the development and manufacture of its race vehicles in a 50 kilometer of London removed place constructed.
It concerns two buildings, in which visits - especially of journalists - strongly limited.
All what happens there, Top Secret is.
The personnel comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and mark Webber.
But speech form into a ball true formula 1 - hero is doubtless the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, that the Energy-Drink-manufacturer puts into the operation of its participation on the race track, further protagonists, whose support is inestimable and its familiarity same zero, hide.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that one five years ago yet was able to say, that the progress contributed in the area of F E for race vehicle with 50 percent to the victory and were responsible the pilots for the remainder.
Today the share values changed. The technology settles 85 percent of the success while the contribution of the pilots is appreciated to 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber never can be replaced by EDP, for they "are not predictable gladiators."

It is the first one out of twenty businesses of existing sale network with respectively 80 to 100 square meters, that intends to open the Multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company arranges this initiative with the already existing 16 sale areas in the more brand business, such as for example PC city, Carrefour, Saturn and el Corte Inglés.

Sabadell wants 'swipe' its rival in three years a million of customer
The managing member of the board of directors of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. It believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, rejects first of all however a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the guilt war.
Nevertheless it predicts try a break-in of the interest spans to balance that the banks with increases of the fees and the prices for loan.
Sabadell expects to catch in three years a million of private customer - a specialty to be existed yet.
Sabadell found the way to empty the coming three years, and to survive so in a very complicated economic background.
The bank will introduce 2011 a new Dreijahresleitplan.
The goal reads to survive not only, without using the public aids out of the FROB, but rather to augment in addition the market share by a million of private customer - 700,000, if one the customers draws-off, that the bank lose becomes -. That is the large challenge before which this bank stands, for until now, it dedicated its business customer more attention than its private customer.
This year it has 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses to manage.
Your market share with private customers is about 3.5 percent while the business customers settle more than 10 percent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of the productivity, sprich Austerität, costs reduction. It will introduce the challenges which the bank stands in opposition therewith together with year conclusion report.
Only a few banks goals venture to determine and to publish it in these difficult times because through the finance crisis worldwide all plans of the banks ran in confusion.
Sabadell will lock this year its four years ago determined lead plan optimums. This was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market condition, it was extended by a fiscal year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, emphasized Guardiola, 2011 would become a "difficult" year "with large range."
The manager assumes, Spain would come only "slowly" out of the crisis.
Moreover it would be "very difficult" to create" in two or three years "work - basically for the survival of the banks.
Also if it assumes, that the war would become abflauen around passives - that the interest margin punished -, become the risk extra charges, that must pay banks and savings banks for its emissions to the receipt of liquidity, when balance shifted for fading profit margins already onto the prices for credit.
"The subjects of liquidities and financing are will exert" structural type and it pressure on the credit.
"We have the rooster not turned off, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," gave Guardiola to.
Banesto gave on Thursday already the arrangement at its Filialnetz from to restrict the award of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Días of that 22nd and 27th of November).
The manager admitted also, the banks pursued momentarily the Stategie, "the fees to increase," to be sure "within a frame" stamped by the competition.
Sabadells lead plan is based on an organic growth, also if the group does not exclude, how always, korporative businesses.
For nothing it does not assure that in Spain "larger business are" necessary.
"In the coming year becomes itself everything change," assures it.
It emphasizes that the need for capital from currently "enormously does not climb" and closes, that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
It is of the opinion could replace, that FROB in Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market.
After it assures, that Sabadell could survive also a temporary closing of the markets, it weakens the argument of some bank that prophesy already a new liquidity crisis.
It emphasizes, one could bring nothing in circulation, but in the difference to the occurrences in June, one could obtain short-term financing over Repogeschäfte and could intercept therewith the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings banks
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that it could come to a fusion wave of the savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks existed not to participate on that in the first phase. They reserved themselves the second round.
On the other hand the general director of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round did not assure would take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the fusions is locked. The inclusion of Cajasol into the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as a second round, it concerned rather adaptations."
"The largest part is locked. It can be that we have in place of of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes already are completed. They were controlled of Banco de España that strongly supported all processes,."
In one of the association of the managers and manager breakfast of organized Aragoniens (ADEA) Olavarrieta carried out that the concentration process "as quickly as possible performed became and that we be satisfied must with the timely flow, that in earlier times, not now, in the frame of the business plans with Banco de España determined became," emphasized he.
"The transition of 45 savings banks with 000 million fortune existence average 28 on 17 with ever 75 500 million a historically incomparable process is. The amount of the financial institutions was reduced around 62 percent and are have it now very much larger, wherewith we that Baseler come off fulfilled," lifted it forth.
Olavarrieta explained, "it would give a row unabgebrachter opinions over the slowness of the process, that Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, for "Banco de España admonishes us to lock" within the specified time end of the year ago.
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain would have and supplemented one of the rigorousest financing systems of Europe and "perhaps" the entire world, that that that would do the anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that we must worry in the present economy economic trend "no" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, that endured a "very important" concentration process, that would become "as quickly as possible" performed.
It remembered also that the Spanish banks had existed the stress tests that the EZB carried out in July, very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin decided on the Beibehalt of the Euros, but set up simultaneously conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government.
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero produced new adaptations measures, begun in tax reductions for small business and small business, the regulation of temporary work business or the lifting of the 426 Euro support for the unemployed, that relate no unemployment compensation, up to the denationalization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports Barajas and el Prat as well as 30 percent of the national lottery.
On the other hand the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, supported swears to out would have the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, that by means of the former district president Felipe González the present crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It would be anticipated, is the Merkels position no mistake of its public work.
To the contrary, it concerns a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the Euro.
At the same time Germany takes in a basically new perspective to the formation of our future, that collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part its partners.
In view of the resistances in Europe, one begins in Germany over three possible exits out of the crisis to spekuliern.
The first: A strong Euro with Germany, Austria, that Netherlands and other countries while the south the Euro areas leave must.
The second: The reintroduction of the Germans mark - although that currently sooner after Science Fiction sounds -, supported of a large part of the public opinion, ca. 50 percent of the population.
The third: A change of the Euros in accordance with German suggestions. That means: more macroeconomic inspection; household leadership would exert; punishment of the countries that infringe the specification; more possible wise the payment attitude of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adaptations measures on the private sector.
The German position is unambiguous and has been outlined already for some time. Therefore there are now no excuses.
First 2009 when both the IMF such as the European commission of stimuli created for deficits and the German government stretched a constitution reform out of the sleeve in order to prevent this from 2016.
That was the first indication of the Auseinanderdriften between that, what held Germany essential (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece.
At that time that strongly was criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany that were public and the published opinion absolute against a rescue of Greece.
In the end Merkel comes out into the last October day on the new with an unambiguous position. It demands a reform of the come off of the European Union in order to enable the rescue of a country and to obligate simultaneously the private loan givers, to carry a part of the costs.
This position was displayed as an antieuropäisch because it pushed the Ireland crisis and all following.
But its suggestion if also somewhat sweetens, was supposed. In the next months, we will participate at the reform of the European Union, that should enable these measures from 2013.
Germany pulled a red line, that thought to not to exceed it.
It says all that - also if now unpopular measures encountered will must - there will be the old functional method of the Euros from this appointment no longer.
The year of birth of a new currency room will be 2013, forced will can receive must, in which the counteracting countries hard are punished, in addition to explain itself insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs.
Germany shows hit must, with high Spar- and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, us, that we a hard growth rate improvement of the productivity and competitiveness as well as positive outside economic balances.
The other alternative, that is based upon indebtedness and building being with gigantic holes in the balance of payments, so how it was cited by Spain in Boomzeiten, simply will not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would not do badly on that to understand it.
It goes not only therefore to drive down the country deficit to the year 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst, what we could do under these conditions, is to be deceived us even.
I hope that the present turbulences pass over in more quiet.
And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us, to the spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood that also so, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large firms at the past Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) shows on that there that in spite of the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create, order in the own house, its way prepared has itself.
But the line pulled red by Germany is there, and it does not look so that on that something would change.
Under the possibilities pulled in consideration, that is that we would have to leave the Euro areas fully plugged with little serious countries not to exclude.
In this case, Germany still could say us, it had warned us.
Sport and rule evasion
Trick such as that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax do not show invention spirit, but the will to go around a sanction.
That supposedly of two players the actually Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) instigated from end in the game of the 23rd of November against the Ajax in the champions League led in addition that much ink was spilt about that, whether it did not concern an unsportsmanlike action or and whether possibly both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
How generally well known is, a couple of minutes lost both player before playing (its team already unambiguously had won) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this manner, and because that actually Madrid its group would cite, the prescribed sanction will fulfill both player in the next league game against the Auxerre and will get into so without cards into the next game phase.
In the end the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the involved players with different cash amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is no new practice, it is to be found sooner frequently in the world of the soccer.
It so far is spread that it is part of the ethic - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules -.
Part of the arisen debate around the represented case is due on that that a team of the soccer club played actually Madrid (that in its hymns noble courage and honor purports and on other occasion its players for similar occurrences punished had) at the same time the leading role, and to the dramatization through Mourinho, that an episode added to its long story than a theatrical and provoking technician to more.
In any case the debate revolves therefore whether this manner forbidden not specifically by the regulations contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions represent a rule evasion. Actually this procedure complies with the regulations of the sport, seem to go around however its sense.
In this matter, the damage caused the sport spirit should be examined.
The sport spirit defended was the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect, that was not endangerd by these actions, for it no aggressive game.
A further aspect of a clean game exists to avoid therein that the counteracting players pull an unjustified utility out of the against team. Also that did not happen.
The paradoxical of the action of the player the actually Madrid is not that it does not correspond to that, what we understand normally under incorrect game or rule evasion, for the evasion of the rule secretly was performed in order to avoid a sanction, but rather it as noticeable as possible should be so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players awaited and supposed the sanction joyful.
Another question is, which type of advantage pulled the counteracting out of the intentional fouls.
Here should be emphasized, brought became became was that the rivals neither into a more unfavorable situation yet advantages for the played game erheischt, for the obvious result of this action that the own team must further play with less players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, for the club does not control then these players.
The advantage exists obviously therein that the players begin the next game phase of the champions League without cards, that could participate threaten hers in a future game.
But it concerns a long-term advantage uncertain to a certain degree because the team could eliminate sometime also. Moreover the players with this procedure receive a sanction and go eliminating in the second card cycle over, in that it because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
Therewith it is not so clear whether it concerns really an advantage.
In the end are not directed such procedures at the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong in order to pull an utmost utility out of the directions.
In this case, the players wanted to go around wanted to select no sanction (that would be actual an unambiguous case of rule evasion), it sooner when they subject itself to this.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a punishment or to flee from its.
Although the boundary is smudged between creativity and rule environment, I believe that it concerns in this matter a clear case of creativity.
I have the impression that the polemics emerged as a result of of two factors: Because it concerned two same obstruction ends, and because of the type of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage, that was added by these actions to the principles of the sport, is less ethicaler than a rather aesthetic type.
Offer offensive to the customer capture for groups Christmas supper in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar lets this year an avalanche of reservation on the days 16th and 17th of December fall.
The celebrations even paid by employee spread out. They do not want to issue more than 20 until 30 Euro.
How the Turrón and the Christmas lottery there are in the Vorweihnachtszeit also again group supper that bring Barcelonas oxygen to the restaurant business and leisure time business. But as a result of the economic crisis, they release a price offensive to catch around also the customer segment, that represents the large mass,: Almost everyone would like to issue between 20 and 30 Euro for a lunch or supper, confirm the questioned entrepreneurs and associations.
So that the accounting becomes another little complicated, the calendar (new year's eve falls on a Friday) has fall let all orders into the week of the 13th of December, with the result of an avalanche of reservation of supper at two Spitzentager (that 16th and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before that.
Since 2008 when the bad times began, adjusted many businesses the group suppers out of household reason.
In order to not to have to forgo this tradition, pay many employees this out of its own pocket.
How the economic trend also always lies, it low prices are demanded, confirms the chairperson of the restaurant group of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not venture to predict himself until now how the holidays will look in this month.
"The people consider hesitated reserve it 'time, before it. ."
"You gladly would like to go out, but it eighth strongly on the prices," emphasizes it.
The business becomes with which well go, "the quality good praising with a good service offer," joins it thereto, and calls us into the memory that the customers save in periods of crisis, why prices are inquired around 25 Euro most strongly.
In a survey in various centrally lain restaurant turns out that that evening the 17th of December the suppliers to the collapse leads.
The group Soteras says, would boom, that to issue demands for this Friday with the intention, less than 30 Euro. The group adapted its menus with complete offer between 25 and 35 Euro to the economic conditions.
In another leading group, Andilana, that maintains 16 restaurants in the city, (Hostal de la Rita, noticed, La Fonda and other), has the characteristic of the calendar to remote reservations, even from beginning of November, led.
"We have the impossible possible made, around the preceding year prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 Euro to maintain," explains it.
In AT Grup, the els Mussol, Attic, QuQu and altogether 23 local leads, loses one the optimism not after since the second quarter the revenue blooms again and is expected good, if also on a few days concentrated outlooks for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group emphasize that also that will be 18th an over active day with friend groups that Christmases celebrate before.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 Euro or more than a price hit. One has the impression that the customers are ready to issue 10 percent more than in the preceding year and in return more details wish, like for example Cava.
Also in some firms, one sees sprout green shoots why the employees are invited again. That mediates the impression that the group meal is again in the upswing.
On the part of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with amalgamations such as the tavern association, restaurant association and leisure time association of Barcelona), the deputy chairperson, Enric Gomà, trusts to see on that the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are altogether right "lively," although the customers knock out" "a maximum.
The joke at the celebrating had not returned to be sure, pays equal who.
The Pakistani nuclear program excites large apprehension in the USA
Islamabad places nuclear weapons "more quickly than each other country here."
Uncovering of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
That of the Internet portal Wikileaks revealed confirms contents of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the US country department, which enormous worries the Pakistani atom program prepares Washington.
At the edge of the clarifying and juicy details, that offer the documents over the contents of the conversations and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that the cooperation between both countries in things is not reinforced atomic security, but rather to the contrary "decreases," and that the unstabile Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster Rhytmus than each other country."
Especially the singularity of the Pakistani atom program - that the weapons not put together are, but rather its components stored become, around in a possible attack its destruction to impede - ready Washington nights sleepless.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report itemizes following risks before the visit of the former leader of the national security council, James Jones,: "The vicinity of some atom plants to the zone attacked by the Taliban, the probable Verstreuung of the nuclear material and the susceptibility of the carrier of nuclear material."
The large person number, that are implies into the nuclear arsenals and the rocket programs, becomes no longer only of the USA, but rather also of Russia as getting out of hand and reason let let happen caution, looked at.
"Pakistan must exertally believing personnel to the guard of the atom plants adjust; based on the low development and cultural level have extremist organizations more possibilities people, that at atom programs or rocket programs cooperate, to reklutieren," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian foreign ministry in a discussion with its North American office colleagues.
Newly at the documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internet portal is that the cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in things of nuclear distribution diminishes and the increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May is explained of an office of the message, that describes the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating,": "Frequently there is no transparency; on auxiliary offer, we received be rejected" no answers or it.
In another communication Peter Lavoy, official of the national secret service confirms for south Asia that "in spite of the economic catastrophe Pakistan produces" nuclear weapons so quickly like no other country.
The ambassador Patterson asks "to clear up" Washington during a visit of the uppermost army leader, general Ashfaq Kayani, the responsible that "Pakistan army has" to adjust its tacit over support of terrorist groups.
On the hunt after Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism battle to the prevention of new uncovering.
Interpol issues a red warning to the pursuit and up establishment of Assange.
All, what holds together with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange,, forms a complicated maze, in whom the circumstances can be enlightened only hard.
Yesterday Interpol abandoned a "red warning" to that "establishment and pursuit" of Assange from.
To be sure it does not concern at the same time a traditional arrangement to the arrest.
Moreover it is not comes new, it of the 20th of November.
It has also nothing with the last uncovering of more than four million diplomatic documents out of the USA to do, but rather with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australian must stand in Sweden.
Furthermore the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, mark Stephens, assures would know "the police where and like it contact with Mr. Assange could" receive.
Already on that 20th the international police authority with seat in Lyon (France) issued the arrangement on proposal of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday upon receipt of the authority through the Swedish authorities.
So the things lie. The 188 Interpol countries are directed to identify and to discover Assange, "around it provisionally to arrest and to deliver."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual concerned by a red warning, many member nations regard after statements of the organization the red warning as a license for an Arrestierung - that of the national police carried out will must - especially if they control a bilateral extradition agreement, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably stays.
The action outraged Assanges lawyers who published gestures a letter, in which they informed about the fact, that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer per video conference the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They remember also that Assange is compared the departure from Sweden applied for and by the district attorney, that to the legend enveloped Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security boss by Stalin,, the corresponding permission received.
"That is like a hunt, not like a legal pursuit," is accused in the letter.
During the world it searches for complies - and its mother of Australia out of the innocence of its son assures - Assange with an unknown place, to be sure not silently.
On Monday it gave the leader of the periodical Time per Skype of an undetermined place out of an interview. In the conversation, it applied for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If proved will can, that it responsibly was for the arrangement of North American diplomats, the UN to spy out and therewith against of the USA signed international come off offend has, must it resign," said he.
Its opinion was convicted yesterday of the press secretary of the white house, Robert Gibbs,, designated that the proposal on resignation as "laughably and absurdly."
"I am certain me not, why we value on the opinion of a type with a website put should," explained it CNN to the transmitter.
Obama itself has a high responsible for the anti-terrorism battle, Rusell Travers, with which prevention of new document uncovering delegates.
The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give Assange less attention, stands in contrast to the opinions, that conservative politicians and commentators in these days announce.
The congresswoman Peter King, that will lead as of January the chair in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the house of representatives, requested the country department to examine the possibility, to set Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "around its moneys to seize and every, that it supported or a contribution performs to pursue."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian Präsidenten Stephen Harper, had gone on yet, and he must had to become" revoked its statements, Assange "murdered.
"Obama would have to change it into a target and a not manned airplane or so what use."
Who did not apologize, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidency candidate.
"Who it also always was, that in the government information ooze let, it is the treason indebted and everything what no execution is, is eiine too mild punishment," explained it Fox to the transmitter.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod near states
The republican leader permitted the party a secret voting over its remaining in the office.
Huguet proposes a pluralisticer government and the end of the plenary assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems found a prescription to have, in order to go to the zigsten time of an internal riot in the rows of the ERC directionless to the loss by 11 delegates and the half the votes out of the way.
The chairman of the party is aware that its resignation threat does not suffice the near state of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira. But it does not know weakened is give becomes also, that the influence of this sector today so like its mentor himself and it the same worry, like other former currents.
To win therefore tried the leader of Esquerra with a wink the new critics, what its position would become to the next municipal elections of certain.
For the beginning announced yesterday on that that secretly could express itself over 200 regional councilors of ERC over its whereabouts in the office.
With Wahlzetteln, not with elevated hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a parking ticket, they could do this without having to fear Repressalien.
Actually the boss both the impression of split such as that of submission would like to avoid under its person.
In several interviews strengthened it, it would become with the half of the voices plus one not confirmed feel, and it joined without statement of percent value thereto, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would be also not good.
The Carod near states demand of the president more to make available its office than only the party. An insufficient gesture because Puigcercós the uppermost organ of the congresses controls.
Do not control but there it a sufficient majority to the Forcierung of resignations, will arrange it with the board of directors an action plan of now until May.
For that they expect, at which elaboration of the document over strategic reorientation that the direction will produce on that 18th the advice to the voting to be able to co-operate.
It is your intention, would rescue for Puigcercós to. In return this should promise, that congress into the autumn 2011 before embarrassed, what considers the party tip already to be a fact.
The chairman of the party of the ERC is would damage strives the view, the "polyphony" the stability and he a for all times on to bring the organization into the situation, to wash its dirty wash behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, that the officiating Conseller Josep Huguet in its blog signed, is, symptomatic.
In view of whose, that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the proprietor of Innovació considered exchange for supported would become it to be a fact, that the chairman of the party "in that different goals."
It itemized five, of which two in the foreground stand.
First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors so that these at least 90 percent of the party members represents, that the inclusion of new faces is named out of Carods background.
The second could be the large novelty.
Huguet proposes, ERC should finally abandon the plenary assembly principle as a functional method.
Therewith it defends enable should a reform of the regulations, that it to hold off the congresses with selected delegated.
Of the termination of the plenary assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system -, Puigcercós is' team, that fought already on the last both congresses, how possessed.
Actual the party leadership with the examination of the plenary assembly principle was delegated on the quaking meeting of 2008 on a congress, that should concern itself with the reformation of the regulations.
This appointment is outstanding yet because infogle of the internal up quiet of the last years was not the concerning of this matter advisable.
Now, without the sectors critical on that more tepid lie, could have come the moment in order to take up this matter again and to lock for always.

"With your voice, on which we wait, is the moment come, you to listen to," emphasizes it.
The message was spread after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for each law except the expansion of the tax reductions out of the times of Bush and the financing of the government expanded would become.
Such a blockade, that was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could itself on the voting of the Dream Act - effect law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the distribution of nuclear weapons.
Over the blockade of the republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects questions, said would trust set up become could the presidency speaker Robert Gibbs, he on that that, if once the tax subject would be solved, a timetable for the remaining projects.

With literature put the finger into the wound
The second round of 'the desire at the language' was a walk with which the participants strongly made themselves for the story
"That with the sex in the language I understand yes, but... The finger in the wound? Is what expected of me"?, asked the author Luisa Valenzuela, that should open the second round of 'lot placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the spanischsprachige literature and on this occasion the subtitle of its question used (on another organization was the round table the sex in the language dedicated, explained it).
The finger in the wound... "Brings us in difficulties," spat consisted the Argentinian writing tels sweetly toward the audience, that mainly of young person, round, who met on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), around this of Marisol Shultz of moderated to attend table, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read marked a text, that it dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz after that as a magnificent story. Luisa tells in first person and is to is learned the protagonist, that on the search, goes what a "wound" is, and from physician to physician, of which she receives to be sure no answer, but references for the clue of its story.
It leaves the Infektologen convinced: "Patience is not is my strength, perhaps that yes my wound."
To the end, after a frustrating approach at the Traumatologen, that stole its middle on the gear the breath, and that its however explains that wound would be no scientific concept, enthült of the psychoanalyst the secret: "The wound is is the really open, the symbolic the scar."
The principle figure of the story sighs eases and closes, only learned that it "of the wound that these really openly would be and not would exist." But it is convinced that the desire mix itself at the language and its falling.
Valenzuela that author played, with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez did not introduce mentioned discovered becomes also a charming story, that he named 'praise of the invention', and in that of the finger in the wound to be sure, but.
With allusion at the magic realism, it tells of a famous magic, that touched the clouds, far traveled men brought back or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made quoted a Kehrtwende and reported of America, the large novel, that it did not be missing from the beginning at its own chronicler, and he Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the redundance of the stories told by the Eroberen.
"Cervantes, that all (the authors) invited us, mocked the feigned witness, that in that as an aware represented stories emerged, but in other manner would be the story of America never tells become - with imagination, that even the sense of shame missing came."
To be sure it is emphasized, "are it the displaced and liar, that the things best introduce," and there reality and lie of one another approach on where one knows no longer, to which side the story belongs, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
It names that actually the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"Of it, we inherited to be that, what becomes" told.
When Mayra Montero was at the row, commented on and praised round contributed had the author the variety of the interpretations, to which the invitation of the FIl to that table of 'the fingers in the wound'.
The cuban and Puertorikanerin dedicated befalls its contribution of the large wound of the social force, that its country - like entirely Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug trade.
"I believe, that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, not intentionally planned engagement contain," declared it after it had emphasized, that literature is communication and obligation, that build up between the author and the readers such as in a "chemical reaction."
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded that evening, whose contribution also "this finger of the engaged author in the wound of the author" hevorhob.
It noted that in a short-lived world also the intellectual habits and the inspection of the consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and forgotten becomes, "that behind every confirmation a small no stands and behind every denial a small yes."
"Around in the possession our thought and the reality to be, must nuance we: And nuancing would mean frequently to put the finger into the wound and to annoy that, that much well feel if they to annoy in the form of caricature, in black and, white think, in prefabricated ideas without shades, and also the powerfuls, that prefer it, the world in black and white to divide noted it and loaded to rediscover in addition a the sense of the letter.
Romano fights for its first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final game, it experienced on that and Abs in its career, but three times it played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different stand itself moreover, of its respective trainers given styles vis-à-vis, and its encounter marked by contrasts reflects itself in the results against.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final game, he experienced on that and Abs in its career, but three times he had decisive games, and previously he held himself well why this opportunity of entirely special importance is for it.
The Argentinian has high played himself with the medal to the second champion, he remained a step behind the victors and amazingly he expedited with the same team successive final games.
The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a trainer in that 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the bridles in the hand, with which he learned a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in that' Clausura 2003' reached he the decisive duel that he lost also with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on that 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', with which they played against lot Diablos, had to put away Rubén again a setback because the game with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 game minutes undecided, but in the eleven meter, it came with 3-1 forwards and got missed turned two possibilities to put its title away, but last of all three of its players the eleven steps and the game to a 4-3.
Rubén had already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival, lost. Therefore it would not like to be pursued once again by the misfortune and free itself by the evil magic in order to be able to celebrate for the first time a title although it strengthens, that for it the most important is the game itself.
"I would like champion become, I would like no statistics break, that is for a club, for my affection, that I me would give away, and therefore becomes the title me come, but what previously happens, is the most important," commented on the helmsman when one questions it over the lost final games.
The last final game remained it yet strong in the memory to have learned it assured, much from that: "The single apprenticeship that we can pull from that, is that until the arbitrator the end does not whistle, cannot celebrate we, are prepared we at the line, were prepared the players also, for the last time we with two eleven meters already on that, to eliminate believe, and I that the one apprenticeship is, until the game is not concluded, gives it no occasion for celebrating."
To know that this series could be decided by eleven meter ski meal, disturbs it not, for it trusts its players: "One wants never in the eleven meter ski meal depend, one would like in the regular game time lock, but sometimes gives it no alternative and one must prepare be, were prepares in the prior tour we, but unfortunately prepared us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of of nervousness or the violent endeavoring, that title to hold already in the hands, that left behind us something for this final game, and we hope that it this time not In addition come becomes."
It lies in Romanso power to be no longer only second champion and to cost for the first time the renown, that the titles with itself bring.

14 presumed Drogendealer arrests
On Wednesday were undertaken in the frame of the failure of a production network and sale network of cannabis of about ten house searches in the administration region Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be placed at the same time vis-à-vis different accusations.
The house searches happened in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at which places should have served that predominantly the drug manufacture.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschisch, cash and equipment, that the production served have, are confiscates become," gave Louis Philippe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec, on.
Altogether eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men come, that count as a head manipulator of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people are supposed to have appeared already hours after its arrest before the justice building in Sherbrooke.
They could among other things the accusation of the production of cannabis, whose possessions are accused to sale purposes, the conspiracy as well as the service by crime.
These house searches had taken place in consequence of a lengthy ascertainment activity, that proceeded over a year long.
"The information preserved out of public hand have it us enables, these arrests to carry out," specified M. Ruel.
About 70 policemen of the regional ascertainment unit Estrien of the security police of the Quebec, the police service Sherbrooke as well as the police authority Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued without any problems
The bill of the conservatives, that according to the government the problem of the ship loaded with secret immigrants regulate should, will be tramped on according to all foresight after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday, that they cannot advocate the suggestion.
"I lean me with stress against this charter on."
"I hold with a party, that you tying up at the feet put has," explained Michael Ignatieff, boss of the liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus session before the met delegate.
The liberals maintained, the bill that permits to hold each of one as of lake ship identified to the carrier by illegal immigrants coming person to a year long, injure proposed so how the Canadian to the right constitution and freedom constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, boss of the Bloc Québécois, pointed just as on to not to be able to support the bill because he would turn against the incorrect target group.
"We are on the other hand and it seems, that all opposition parties on the other hand would be, therefore become we await, what the government undertakes," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism with respect to the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, showed the critics of the hand, who demand, its party would not behave steadfast enough vis-à-vis the secret immigrants.
"The Neo democrats are therewith agreed, that one measures against the blind passengers seizes, and just this try we through settlement of another bill, the C-35, to put through," led Chow on.
We do not advocate the bill of the conservatives therefore because it seeks the guilt in the fugitives and children at least a year long caught holds," explained Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with the politics and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians announce the delegate urgently that they do not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal processes that concern Canada and that treat" the country such as a doormat.
"You expect, that Canada hard measures seizes," so the reaction minister Kenneys.
"The government no confidence at all vote announced regarding its bill, that would have been able to lead the country to choices, that the government would have rejected.
A conservative expressed however vis-à-vis the agency QMI, the government would convene a vote so that every opposing delegate would explain himself immediately vis-à-vis its voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
In spite of the announcement of the possible foundation of a new, standing unit to the battle against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, numerous observers demand further the development of a public board of enquiry to this subject.
Robert Dutil, minister of the public security, maintains, this idea would not come of yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January the New York department of Investigation regarding this subject.
The metropolis has controlled since 1870 a standing unit against the corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one.
One must say in addition that this measure was not discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebecer police service on the 29th of October last year in spite of the presence Robert Dutils in the slightest.
It did not be missing also that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement qualified done handicrafts solution" with regard to public security as rabbit" done magic "out of the hat as well as "at a table end right.
Minister Dutil had turned for its part again to those, that fear, that the political power too much influence would have on the in question standing, future unit.
"You become the result see, if we it announce become," was content to strengthen itself it.
"One is himself this problem aware."
In accordance with Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, can replace nothing the execution of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest on that persists to want to prevent the development of this board of enquiry, the more become the people such as you and I think to conceal that he something has," explained he.
"The single means, an investigation sow shot form to can, is the resignation of Jean Charest," declared for its part Yves Boisvert, instructor to be ethics and politics systems at the ENA (staatl. University to the education of high administration officials).
In order to come out out of this dead end, it proposes engage can the Quebec to clear the finance test inspection a special mandate, therewith this investigations corresponding over corruption and secret arrangements.
"One capably should be, the mandate of the test inspection to expand," decided it.
It represents just as the opinion that the Quebec of the test inspection could clear the same power authority such as commissioners, what would permit its also on to obligate the people to the statements.
The development of a standing unit is not the single project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec will demand of Ottawa just as to alter the criminal law indicating, in order to be adjusted better to this type of crime.
This demand comes of the senior state prosecutor of the operation Marteau, that the attorney general Jean Marc Fournier informed about that, that the jurisdiction in this type of the punishment pursuit is not unambiguous.
Vic Toews, state minister for public security confirmed for its part, its colleague of the justice, Rob Nicholson, would sit down currently with determined, this dossier amendments relevant apart.
During the operation Printemps 2001, that the groups of the motorcycle policemen concerned, 131 people had been arrested although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa put through as a result of its the law against Gangstertum.
If floated under severe supervision
Several river courses remain based on the high precipitations, that poured for Tuesday in some regions of the province, further under severe guard.
In Shawinigan, in the administration region Mauricie, came it on Wednesday afternoon to a landslide.
Two houses preventively were evacuated.
In the evening a further landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides in which administration region Lanaudiere happens, has itself.
A street sank together at the same time in itself.
Strong rain cases of 40 poured up to 70 milliliter precipitations on several regions of Tuesday on Wednesday evening.
Between 20 to 40 further millimeters precipitation were expected here corresponding to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the region Outaouais were concerned most strongly.
Here showers had descended altogether up to 100 millimeter.
To add there to these precipitations yet the snow enamels is, that gathered already in certain branches, the infringing of several water courses is feared.
On Wednesday evening were exclaimed of the Quebecer security service of alerts over the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region Lanaudiere.
The river courses in the north, in Saint Jérôme, in the Laurentinischen mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become here the object of the flood supervision and remain also further under observation.
In the region Lanaudière, the violent precipitations stretched the infringing of some lakes in Sainte Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as also in Rawdon after.
In Saint Calixte, an evasive bridge was carried away based on the strong rain cases.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the infringing of certain lakes caused the closing of several streets, especially in the community Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains further in alarm readiness and supervises the situation genauestens, so security council Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer country flood center published for its part on Wednesday alerts of the strong increasing of several rivers, especially of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont in part rebuked
The Quebecer broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast standards (CCNR) because of its controversial remarks over social care and Haitianer just as as because of its abusive speech manner over radio.
The CCNR represents the opinion, M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM teams would be right to be sure the on own statement of opinion, to be sure would have certain remarks "inexact information about the social care and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitianer as well as also one so ungehobelte speech manner contain, is" that the during the day radiated shipments not appropriate.
The supervisory board had concluded also that a discussion over suicide, that includes the distribution of the names of these people, that suicides committed, against which code of the broadcast offends.
The CCNR had received several troubles regarding that during that in the period of 2008 and 2010 radiated shipments made commentary.
The first decree became sun per inserted commun as a result of a trouble of the "front the assistées sociales you Québec."
The activist organization had burdened itself that the sums named in the shipment would be inexact.
The moderators should give rather solidly as misleading information.
With respect to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion, would be the suicide an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervision councilors had pulled the conclusion, let the mediated message be herewith that suicide might not be looked at as a solution by life crises.
"The majority of the supervisory board considers, cut would have that the in question standing consequences of the shipment" Dupont le midi" a sensitive subject in and suitable type suitable for families and manner."
Therefore it was covered with no blame at all vis-à-vis its person.
The last issue concerned the statements that had had references to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean René Dufort had delivered themselves relating to this a medium effective dispute conversation that a quantity had evoked of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained to not to have contributed for the benefit of the Haiti aid because one would not know with certainty, whether the needy would receive also really the financial donations.
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these commentaries of improper character had not been, that however its cumulative effect would present an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitianer.
"I served" already my three-day suspension punishment in this thing.
"My document is since one and a half years chaste," explained the moderator.
In all decisions, the supervisory board denounces the distribution of an ungehobelten expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM broadcast announcer had acted "on the far side of its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, that had announce should among other things its decisions uniquely during the head broadcasting time within a time period of three days, are negligible.
A king of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, hit an entirely special course.
The athlete, that in "Sanda" (full contact Kung Fu), in the Kickboxen as well as in the Thai box brilliert, climbs now in the search for new challenges on the deed Americans and into the box rings of the world.
"I have 12 years ago in Algeria with battle sports such as Kung Fu and Kickboxen begun," declared Zemmal, that has been resident since 2008 in the metropolis, in order to develop further under the pro.
I personally seek the battle everywhere because for that, that the ground battle, how it the mixed battle arts present, do not like, are contests in North America scarce."
Recently that of its sign had given working as well as at the firm UPS engaged as a security official its rival novelties bad, in which he obtained in that between that 23rd and 30th of October in Edinburgh, Scotland, expedited world championship of the amateur two gold medals of the worlds carats as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I have the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickboxens and the Thai box obtained," explained it.
"Currently ready I me on the world cup in the San Shou in China before."
Those fighters had been invited "out of every category, had" that themselves in the last world championship under the first four placed.
"I babe 2009 in Toronto bronze got."
I became" "2005 in Vietnam figure eight.
"2007 have I the tournament in China on the fifth place concludes, while I 2009 in Toronto third become am," joined it thereto.
"It is worth mentioning that I have" made in every contest of progress.
"With this rhythm, I become this time or in the next year first become"!
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are from China coming disciplines with which punches and kick just as as ground throws are allowable.
The duels happen normally on a platform, rarer in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter, who followed out of this type of the battle sport, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le that is well well known in the world of the battle arts.
If Nacer Zemmal only a single event in its career should retain, it would become here its presence with security in the super tournament "King of Sanda," that super Bowl of the Kung Fu name.
"This contest is the around highest and in China of most esteemed," explained the sympathetic great guy.
"It is a little like that equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won its first battle in the semifinal of its category (80kg) before it lost then in the finale.
"That, that me overcomes has, was a real pro," analyzed it.
"It gives four comrades-in-arms per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinal meet respectively in the finale of its category."
"Then the victors of every category offer themselves the forehead in order to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung Fu."
450 Million in contracts without announcement
Hydro Québec allowed project planning firms in mutual agreement 450 million dollars at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
Middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium stands, consisting of the firms BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor that received the most important share, namely that of the project direction, to a sum of 295 million dollars without announcement.
This consortium, named "Énergie gérance," was formed 2004 as an accompaniment of the decision of Hydro Québec, that private sector to entrust its responsibility, this important, hydroelektrische project in height of a sum of 5 billion dollars.
Beginning 2005 managed to grab the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there would have been a public announcement.
For the Parti Québécois, that represents fall back on business consortia a serious ethical problem, that conjures up the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase.
"This is a new type and manner of a rigged game and weakens the competition."
"That means, that one instead of rigged games instead of on secret type and manner now in open form carries out," explained yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ, on the press conference.
At the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, for it seems heavily intelligibly to it how the interest of the public can be served on this type and manner.
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon on that in that she placed vehemently in agreement, that it would have concerned in this contract a rigged game.
"I remain my line faithful," it cursed in that it strengthened, the PQ would be "dishonest" advanced and it "false its at hardness."
It said, it "would be the least" that the PQ would apologize.
The model of the consortium is worldwide current practice.
It concerns usually a temporally so temporary alliance, that permits it two or several business, to bundle its expertise with respect to a commandment on an announcement for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" shows a high complexity level regarding its work size.
The building procedure is in the gear and is supposed to be set up until 2012.
Nevertheless the contract was forgiven, without that a competition had been able to take place; there had been already negotiations.
Moreover the model of the consortium in the Quebec itself represents more in relatively simple projects in no way an exception.
How the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, that in the area of the Bauingenieur- and consultation being is model of used the consortium object of government ascertainments.
A short flying over of the Quebecer of business index permits it to name more than 200 consortia, of which some of steady duration seem to be.
On this type and manner, the firm collaborates for example the sow in partnership with the majority of its kernel competitors, to which CIMA count +, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult,.
Each connection, and therefrom there are several dozens, attributes to one and the same juristic person, namely on the sow.
What concerns the consortium "Énergie gérance," emphasized minister Normandeau, constructed subjected is that "the territory of that James of a special labor force dynamics and that Hydro Québec accords" this fact since the '70's in special type and manner calculation.
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la James (SEBJ) constructed, delivered an explanation, has let that the nose over the fact hulls that the contract was allowed over the project direction after agreement.
"If you make an announcement and there is only a few applicant, your prices become into the height of fast."
"You have therefore two possibilities: either you take be the people, that on this Mart and say will negotiate": one a satisfying agreement to a good price to you.
"The thought is however, that not the price decisively is, but rather the special intellect of the people," strengthened Laporte.
This contract allowed the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part dollar preserved a long list by contracts over more than 50,000 by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts became either approves of the Hydro Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After examination, the newspaper counted "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer contracts and adviser contracts, that firms or its branch were allowed, under that especially resource laboratory, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin had snatched up 22 contracts at itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and the sow 10 without including herewith its participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts were negotiated.
They amount to included themselves in that entirely on 449,783,344 $, therein the contract with "Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $.
Sylvain Simard had be reported let, form would be that the four firms, that the consortium (BPR, the sow, Groupe SM and Axor) the "Parti libéral you Québec well well known."
Minister Normandeau had be discernable let, the PQ would be likewise connected with the firms, that it "financed" before she specified, that it would concern rather its managements.
Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not confidence awaking
Greener, but frank sceptically.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence to the head participants of the persistent growth, however just as few to the marked brands or the organically markings, that should drive its choice.
Damage although it bathes in a medium effective universe, where it swarms with information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer consumption responsible has a lack of trustworthy information to lament, an insufficiency, that makes itself than a brake of its engagement recognizable, how the first reading showed, that was held off yesterday.
Although they pushed the consumption of the so named socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecer seem nevertheless that that try to sell this to accord little credit.
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population gives to give in the deed the environment engagement of the firms just as little belief like the green business advertising, betrays the gauge contrived by the responsible consumer center the university Sherbrooke.
Another condition: the half of the consumer doubts the confidence worthiness of the official certificate joined at the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally aware, so the barometer.
After same pattern, the discourse of the politicians seriously is taken to this subject of solely 14.6% of the Quebecer population.
The information with respect to responsible consumption seems nevertheless importantly to the Stimulation of this consumption segment, that is animated currently by approximately only of one-third the Quebecer consumer.
In the deed, void and doubtful character of the information softened the zeal of 46% of the consumer.
This is after the higher price of the products the second brake identified on the part of the barometer.
Moreover one-third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency stands the green products and services, that one is to be put striven them at the hand, distrustfully vis-à-vis.
According to another communication had changed its habits already over the half of the consumer in 2010 and changed predominantly the brand one or several products in order to give its conviction expression.
According to barometer, they had preferred also to 61% purchase with dealers of its quarter and had favored the purchase of groceries cultivated in its region.
Greener and more responsibly - the index of the environmentally aware consumption had this year a 64 the maximal value of 100 reaches - the homo consumus of the Quebec loves it to present himself as a king of the recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left behind in the environment in that he attends to the animal protection.
Yet the social and ecological consciousness seems indicated to make nevertheless before its car simply, so the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecer, used into 2010 public transportation or to have preferred the agency for shared rides, in order to demonstrate its ecological interest.
The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycling were advocated also of 39.1% of the participant of this comprehensive behavior survey, that feeds the cliché presentations.
Government bond for the acceptance of eXcentris
To be involved the Quebecer government, that was requested by the Société Angus as well as the business Parallèle in addition, financially in the acceptance of the movie theater complex eXcentris, explains itself with a collaboration agreed, however only in form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus as well as the business Parallèle, that had hoped for itself a contribution in height of seven million dollars of the ministry of education and cultural affairs to the acceptance of the Daniel Langlois of belonging movie theater complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to entrust this again of its actual cineastischen function, receive evidently not, what they demanded.
The government accepted to be sure to involve itself in this thing, to be sure to its own conditions.
Instead of the expected contribution, the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in slighter than the initially hoped for height, that could call an existence capable solution to advantageous conditions into life, at least in the opinion of that out of the national rumor kitchen entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million had been rejected already last spring by the Quebec, the favor petition was corrected since that again sum moderate downward.
A suggestion together with an action plan became already of the president of the "Société de développement of the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, at minister St Pierre sent, that leads the document eXcentris.
Several days ago it had approach let it a last special report.
The counter-proposal of the cabinet was transmitted the SODEC however on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus have now to the 31st of December time to answer on this.
In any case the premise of the country contribution seems pressed become really the side to be.
Let's call in memory that the Quebecer owner partnership of the movie theaters and movie theater complexes had resisted itself against a direct country investment to the support of the acceptance of eXcentris, in that it proposed the argument, the minister of culture would have us no financial aid for real estate projects there to perform, that it would not have approach let also other movie theater halls.
Several other market participants of the segment sued for however in contrast to that substantial, economic assistance.
Movie theater boss Daniel Langlois had after the own financed construction of the movie theater over for ten years under large difficulties the author movie theater in the accomodations of its movie theater complex presented, what could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of movie theater halls that independent films show, is knew in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris to hold its clientele in the pole.
The Société Angus as well as the business Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the tip, head for on their part a privately financed Campagne, of which they hope for itself a sum 700,000 $ in order to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring 2009 only a single linen has continued therewith to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
It is check goal of the future Erwerber, that three movie theater halls at the 27 February next year with the demonstration the very gelungenen of film of Xavier Beauvois "the to open et of the dieux" newly.
Christian Yaccarini however did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored one, what it and its group of the downward corrected suggestions hold, that one made them.
Secret of the complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat directions that were spread by WikiLeaks ventilate the secret over that, what the United Nations consider under the inferiority complex of the Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; they put however the superiority feeling with the same blow last-nameder vis-à-vis Canada openly.
Consequently the American diplomats are astonished about the fact that the Canadian voter has not in the ballot the Canadian American relations in the sense, and believe it, that the visit of president Obama would have the conservative government at the same time helped to put through its budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington that publicly were spread yesterday offer yet more spicy details as the bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble.
A connection dating by the 22nd of September 2008, i.e. in the period, in which the federal Wahlkampage in the full gear was present, reports about that, from which point the United Nations are involved no longer in the uses discussed by its political bosses.
For large astonishment of David Wilkins, the ambassador used, American in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation.
"An inferiority complex almost characterizing the Canadians contingently causes possibly the Canadian, political managements much sooner in addition, over internal issue of the everyday life to speak, when the United States in this choice the black Peter to impute (like 1988 in the campaign over the free trade) ," describes he.
The United Nations, concludes it, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but potentially too threateningly in order to speak" about it.
The ambassador understands this "deafening quiet" the fewer because both countries intensive political and economic relations cultivate.
"Logical manner," values it, "should it the capacity of a candidate, a party and yet much more of a party chief for leading a such essential relation be, that of the voters in the going to the polls than a key factor in the sense has."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in that at the 22nd of January 2009 of Terry Breese, business carrier in Ottawa, sent communication that should prepare Präsident Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa.
"Your trip at the same time will help, the further existence of the government in the confidence vote over the federal budget beginning of February to guarantee, with which Canada its first deficit after more than a decade well known give becomes, that based on an animation program in the height of 30 to 40 billion dollars emerged is," describes Breese.
Nowhere it had mentioned that the government had had to adjourn the parliament session before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be fallen by the coalition and would affect the so contingent further existence of the opposition parties the quality of the proposed animation program.
A further, from January 2008 dating and on the part of the ambassador Wilkins communication composed notifies Washington of the always more negatively becoming picture that the series radiated, dramatic over CBC spread by the United States.
The ambassador is disturbed over shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusion at Maher Arar, that can observe "No-Fly-List" or also Abführungen to the purpose of through muscle swanks of the CIA of carried out interrogation.
Again another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clinten in its French office colleagues Bernard Kouchner had asked in its first bilateral meeting after that, whether Europe would be ready to receive certain prisoners out of Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner should the question with yes answered have, to be sure on the basis of an individual "case to case" -decision.
Àm end of the meeting, described, "has it the country secretary a paper as regards Omar Khadr issued, a 15-year-old Moslem of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State accepted to look through" the document again.
Let's notice in in the end yet that the minds get hot with respect to the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper of very closely standing advisers, had explained over CBC that that should "killed" become for this massive leak of responsible.
It had reported here on Mike Huckabee out of the United States.
Worldwide plan to the renewal of the illumination
The UN proposed yesterday a plan in Cancun to the renewal of the illumination of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the realization of a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), corresponds that to almost one-third of the additional reduction, that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes in hopes its position in the step of the concrete large projects to transfer that the UN in Cancun in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
After the plan proposed yesterday, the main problem in form would be avoided the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the CFC delivered based on the illumination on the earth if the incandescent pears, that represent previously another monopoly by 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced, by fluorescing or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The illumination is responsible for 8% of the worldwide emissions.
This corresponds one equivalently of 70% of the exhaust fumes of the worldwide Fuhrparks.
In Copenhagen, the large Abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe and other had last year whereby also Canada counted, to voluntary reduction plans promised, that should screw down the global CFCS emissions of 53 Gt on 49 Gt.
Of this balance, one would have to draw-off however yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize of today to the year 2020 the climate climb around 2 degrees centigrade, in order to prevent that this runs except inspection.
In the incandescent pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact lamp material pears, the energy consumption decreases reduces around 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one this energy demand once again around the dual.
The compact lamp material pears hold on average between 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like for example that, that the manufacturers Philips this week on the market brought has - this company has by the way at the UN study participated - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent pear, what mediates a hint of the save possibilities of the substitution plan, that is supposed to be used in 100 countries.
Next to the fact that iese deliver totally novel light bulbs only very little warmth, can function it also with a rule resistance.
And they contain no mercury at all.
Several specialists showed that compact lamp material pears reserves show, because it must contain mercury and that one must dispose of it therefore as a special rubbish, what is not always possible in the developing countries, except the makers make available an acceptance place.
The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact lamp material pear according to the report however, but rather rather the coal power plants that eject substantially more mercury in order to produce the electricity wasted by the incandescent pears.
Alone in the United States, these coal power plants 25,000 eject tons of mercury annually.
The report represents detailed the profits, that each country would gain thanks to this international program.
Indonesia would save so for example a billion of dollar annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalently of 3.5 coal power plants, whose building would cost Indonesias 2.5 billions.
Ivory Coast expected excited the announcement of the choice results
UN secretary-general Ban Ki moon demanded the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election the ivory Coast directly after its expiration.
"The secretary-general underlines the necessity of the independent choice commission, its work to receive and the preliminary results without further delay to announce," emphasized a press officer of the UN boss.
"It asks all parties and institutions of the ivory Coast to provide proof of its responsibility and to abstain" every initiative to the announcement of the preliminary results.

On Wednesday multiple proclamations became out of the entire world loud, may exclaim the CEOS yet finally the name of the victor of the second choice round under the Laurent Gbagbo separating out of the office and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo warehouse reckons however with the annulment of "deceitful" votings in the north through the constitution advice, that were obtained by the former rebel warehouse of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the in September 2002 failed coup.
Pascal Affi N' Guessan, leader of the presidency campaign of the ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiceen on the part of the FN to the intimidation of the voters in the north of the country the followers of the president had deterred to go to the choice.
The entire choice could be nullifyed if the complaints inserted by Gbagbo are considered by the constitution advice.
The Gbagbo contractors are however now more of the view that the highest court of the country would not be neutral, because it is led by Paul Yao N' Dré, one politically closely with Gbagbo of connected.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, who contests jedwede connection to the former rebels, the delay judged in the announcement of the choice results as "unacceptably" and asked Gbagbo to respect this, also if he did not go so far to call for the victory.
Its alliance parts strengthen, Gbagbo would block the publication of the results because it would know, that it lost would have; and a trouble before the constitutional court to submit after one had prevented the choice commission on that to publish the results, seie illegally.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were considered to be the culmination of the union process and reconciliation process of a country, that was split for years in two parts.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday the politicians of the ivory Coast before that, it could in the case by possible riots for this responsible held become.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first choice round on the 31st of October with 38% of the voices vis-à-vis that 32% for Alassane Ouattara, that the public support of the former Präsidenten Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round enjoyed), when leading candidate brought behind itself.

Affaire Clotilde of rice: the Elysée palace its mediator function exaggerates for Syria
Within more than six months, of July 2009 until May 2010, held the fate of Clotilde of rice, a young French researcher, that was held in the Iran because of "espionage," the French public in breath, transferred the diplomacy in alarm readiness and accented the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
This all under the attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.
That of WikiLeaks of preserved and of the newspaper "Le moons" documents of looked through American give some backgrounds of this crisis price.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, that went so far to give these pieces of advice to the contact with its own crisis of "takings of hostages" in the Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French responsibles tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman the release of Majid Kakavand not, one in France caught held and of the American justice on the basis of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program of sought Iranian to the Gegeleistung would have.
In the end they set had played the type and manner, with which the French presidency has to manipulate tried the media to the purpose, to make this the idea plausible, the Syrian president Bachar al Assad a central role in the release of Clotilde of rice, into a harsh light.
In truth, it had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram revised at the 12th of August 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French commentaries to the type and manner of the contact with takings of hostages."
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategy questions, conversed in accompaniment of Patrice Paoli, director of the dock d' Orsay for North Africa and the mediator orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained its the French method.
That advised bring back to set all on that, around its own citizens, that would be held violent in the Iran, to the Americans.
"Power noise," said it, "articulates loudly and clearly and without intermission" the words "reason human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, that pays attention very sensitively to its image.
This "does not operate the more especially since you the Iranians ask to do" that.
For "silence solves nothing," past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, the Iranians "masters in evasive maneuvers" are.
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners would be a "familiar, Iranian tactic": "Taking of hostages to the purpose of political extortion."
It gives "would demand notice on, the release of Clotilde of rice out of the prison (that at the 16th of August into being come should, at the day, at that it itself into the French message flees) the payment of a large sum of money at the Iranians" (230,000 Euro bond).
And it lets disclose, the Elysée would anticipate worsen becomes" "further takings of hostages, a phenomenon, that.
The Iranians could "in the near future one others the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest, that in the Iran live," said he.
28th of August 2009.
Clotilde of rice was released twelve days ago out of the prison, is held however further in the Iran.
An information was brought was released in circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the united countries demand based on illegal trade with sensitive electronics material at the Irans, after decree of a judge in Paris out of the custody.
The American message stands, like numerous other observers, questions about this disturbing Koinzidenz.
For Washington, that pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material planned for the nuclear program, the release by Majid Khakavand represents a bad novelty.
Did France take a cow trade in purchase?
The release of the Iranian against that one of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a renewed conference with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th of September, François Richier assures that this would not be the case.
The Elysée, says it, was not only "totally surprises of the decision of the judge," but rather would have also tries to resist itself on the other hand.
"There was" a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French attorney general (presently Michèle Alliot Marie), but "the French government can the judicial decision do not change," explains he.
Mr. Richier would like to refer also on that that Majid Kakavand stands further under "severe" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser selects a phone number, puts again up, informs "would be then the American diplomat, the Iranian in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris" currently.
During the safe-keeping of Clotilde of rice in the Iran, the Elysée does not protect its efforts to make believe attempt" by means of announcements and of the media of organized "flight, the Syrian president Bachar al Assad would play an "important" and "influential mediator roll."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and establish that the manipulations fruits carries, because several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating by the 25th of August 2009 conjures up "the medium flash of the French authorities."
Whereon so much is based "Dankesbezeugung" vis-à-vis Mr. Assad, asks itself the Parisians message.
The French authorities admit praise price full "in spite of its explanations secretly that they have only one vaguely premonition therefrom, what the Syrier have" actually done.
The document concerns itself then with the reasons, that brought the Elysée in addition to decay this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aims on that off, Sarkozys politics of the opening vis-à-vis Syria to confirm," analyzes it.
A 2008 launched politics, that "of numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad at that time as premature and undeservedly perceived became."
"The Syrian roll billowing" tries to bring to the attention of Paris "Syria, which Belobigung one can obtain, in that one plays" a constructive role in the region.
It is goal moreover, "discord between Syria and the Iran to sow."
The American message knows this on good authority.
On the 11th of August, François Richier had entrust you: "Obviously we do not know whether the Syrier what have" also always made.
"But we thanked" us in spite of all with them.
"This should establish" at least confusion at the Iranians.
Clotilde of rice returns to France on the 16th of May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a Kommuniqué, it thanks the President Brazil, the Senegal and Syria for its "active roll for the benefit of the release of our compatriot."
No Online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government becomes a law, named "the Cinderella," dismiss, which will forbid it the youth to play after midnight Online Games in that it blocks them the access, pointed government responsible on.
A bill, that should request that Online-game-operator in addition, to forbid youth under 16 years after midnight the access to these games, is produced the parliament in December, described representative of Kultus- and family ministries.
"Many children play this Games the entire night long and have then difficulties with learning in the school and also therewith to lead" a normal life during the day.
"We are of the opinion, that this law is necessary, around its health and its right on sleep to guarantee," explained Jo Rin, with this bill of entrusted Ministerialbeauftragter of the French press agency Agence France press.
Let the Online Games be after that renewed from 6 o'clock in the morning accessible.
The manufacturer companies would have a year long time to prepare themselves for the application of the law, specified it.
To ask the government of casks just as into the eye, the manufacturers, who screw down daily these games for the access to time limits granted that youth, whose parents ask therefore, the responsible added.
It would make available just as that people who wish it, free programs, that enable it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is "networked" one of that at that usually countries, and the newspapers report regularly of different events connected with intensive Internet utilization.
The country is moreover undisputed champion in worldwide Online-Game-competitions.
In November south Korea had obtained four gold medals in the world Cyber Games vis-à-vis 58 further nations.
World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA the from judge country appoints
In bright excitement on the basis of corruption suspicion, the executive committee of the FIFA will appoint on Thursday the from judge countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice with which the rank el threaten to press the technical criteria around influence as well as the Lobbying into the background.
A thing is certain however: the edition of 2018 the king discipline of the FIFA becomes in Europe, its traditional stronghold, take place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).
The edition 2022 then somewhat more exotically will fall out; the international soccer association hopes to be able to win after the premiere on the African continent into 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself, or to pursue its agency in the United States or in the far east (Japan, south Korea) further.
The list of the personalities, that to the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of the government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the measure of the economical and political use of a world championship purports.
The wheelings and dealings behind the scenery threaten to stop therefore to the last minute.
To set up hard otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) document bessseren arguments as that of its competitors.
But these deliberations will not be so serious for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees to the hour of the choice.
The Sunday Times, that stood with the arrangement of the suspension of these members the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the uncovering, would have just as well the chances for its own country, cradle of the soccer, ruin can, expedite might that only a single time the world championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had given that on Monday again breeding ground in that it had radiated a Dokumentarbericht, that three influential members of the Kommitees, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under gunfire takes.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English responsibles in embarrassment, that had operated primarily an intensive Lobbying with David Cameron in this last week.
The head of the government hopes for a reprint the of its predecessor Tony Blair gelungenen gambit that had obtained the organization of the Olympic games 2012 in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive use suffice in order to revalue the image of England before the Kommitee again?
Is nothing certain less, for the duo Spain Portugal it is not missing at trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
Yet the economic and financial shadow sides both countries could soften its ambitions.
The possible Repressalien against the Englishmen as well as the doubts over Solvenz of Spain and Portugal let increase the chances of Russia, that became in spite of its spaces in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, carrier) the serious outsider.
Prime minister Vladimir Putin concluded however, that denounced frank hints on the accusation of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the voting" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
"One plasters it with dirt, one tries, it to compromise," cursed Putin.
For 2022, the United States seem to be, strengthened through the experience of 1994, the logical favorites.
First economical world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages vis-à-vis Japan and south Korea, that set up separately a very beautiful project.
Yet these new candidacys seem premature for two countries, that had organized with the contests in 2002.
Another threat: the permission be named longed for by the FIFA of the World Cup 2026 for China, that let become the Asian chances for 2022 null and void.
With Australia and Qatar, that had pulled all indices with the attendance of futuristic stadiums, the FIFA pursues place its expansion toward new areas, however both countries a larger risk, for certainty there.
Australia could just as as have to suffer Japan and south Korea from that of the European countries akquittierten weakness of the TV rights (based on the time difference), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the obvious-ness
De Gaulle really had supported.
Middle edge had believe let that it would support.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy yet less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée summons the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious-ness does not stand the side of the Mysteriums that fastens the presidency function, well to face.
Therefore one must do so as if the doubt would exist henceforth.
In the one, like also in the other sense.
2006 purported the followers Jacques Chiracs, a third mandate would not be excluded without believing even on that.
Nicolas Sarkozy assured on the 15th of November in serious tone to make its decision "sometime in the autumn of the year 2011."
That it would be discernable let on Tuesday evening the perspective of "two mandates" in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians, had spread accordingly a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of its candidacy?
Far been missing.
The president let remember solely that the constitution change of 2008 would restrict the amount of the five five year-old office periods on solely two.
It made a determination, no announcement.
It is not the first time that it mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meeting in a humorous tone.
"You still have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," explained it in July 2009 to them.
On a new in May 2010: "Does not believe that I do not think" about the phase after that.
Its words of the day before yesterday make it no longer to the candidate as on the day before; but also not fewer.
If they should evoke commentaries, then for a dual reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the HP on a side.
It is not however the reception of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy in addition to reveal itself.
To the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the HP admonish supposed more prematurely than to the declaration of war.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the rights would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to survey of the BVA-L' express).
"We have a candidate, and it gives with the UMP no discussions at all about that," reacted directly and carefully the background of the prime minister.
"If it a defeat as possible find would become, would be it not candidate," divides Jean Pierre Raffarin with.
"It always on that will believe, win to can," corrects Alain Juppé, that came to terms with the obvious-ness.
Euro: the EZB is forced to retain its purchases of country paper
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the EZB in the past year should offer opportunity to show possibilities how one comes out out of the crisis, or announce at least the arrangement of a large amount at unorthodox measures of the monetary policy, that should come end of the year to its conclusion.
The crisis of the European country indebtedness obligates, the central bank in Frankfurt not doubtless can afford it, also the current to forfeit more than a tense situation on the European loan markets, in order not to evoke its aggravation.
The political costs at the same time would be by far too high.
The French Treasury Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed yesterday that of the EZB on the occasion of a press conference taken in, active roll for the benefit of the solution of the country household of indebtedness Europe.
It did not venture to say whether it would be of the opinion, the central bank could do yet more, for example through boosting of its program of the purchases of government bonds.
"I retain my deliberations for my European trade partners before (..) ."
Jean Claude Trichet, president of the EZB had not appeared in Brussels on the day before on the occasion of its hearing through the economy shot and currency sow shot of the European parliament very eloquent regarding its intention, but rather is content fall out" itself rather to refer on that that the program of the purchases would become "continue to operate" of country paper on the secondary market and that we become "see in the meeting on Thursday, like the decisions.
Only certainty: The EZB will leave its prime lending rate unchanged in 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In the practice, the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled of the EZB last week on approximately 1.35 billion Euro.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers, it should yesterday new purchases at Irish and Portuguese country paper handled have.
Altogether the central banks of the Euro system undertook since May 2010 purchases in the amount of 67 billion Euro.
Under the dealers, the Antizipation of a following of the purchase course is disputed in no case (see side 29).
The economists expect already no remarkable course change more.
If the loan businesses of more than three months will have disappeared already out of the arsenal of the EZB, becomes to create make itself latter yet at the unrestricted money means reserves on freigiebige type, and to be sure over a period from a week to three months.
The economists make grasped themselves already today on that that this measure will expand yet around some months.
"I cannot introduce me that the EZB becomes" alter its program on essential type.
"Otherwise would become it the risk go in, new tensions on short visibility to provoke," assumes Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"An exit 2011 planned, progressive for the course the first quarter seems me more probably," anticipates for its part Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the market of the country indebtedness "should the EZB such a purchase volume at bond upright hold, that the inert market animates," joins Norbert Bräms thereto.
In consideration of the relevance of the exposed position the European banks on the markets of the country indebtedness in the Eurozone the central bank has no other choice when its presence to retain on the market.
"You must to every price at the Steller of the lacking investors on the market step and so act, around the hasty enthusiasm over the yields paid at the weakest countries to prevent," attested yesterday an important bond proprietor.
For if the interests rates prepare to the height flight, the countries would be prevented yet more on that to reduce its indebtedness or to stabilize also only.
This is the price to the protection of the Euro.
The government Berlusconi goes in Italy in cover
After a beginning of the week disturbing for Italy, the situation relaxed yesterday with the decline of the Eckzinsen on 10 years a few.
A return to the deceitful quiet.
At the end of the meeting with the Secretary of Commerce, the region chairpeople Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "indecipherable" qualify and have reckon hear it with an "unvorhersagbaren" weekend, what the relevant denied however immediately.
On Tuesday in any case the scissors would have reached with the German interests rates its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to the cover of the bankruptcy risk had increased on 263 points, what had evoked a certain panic in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had referred at its cabinet council on that that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interests rates is about 400 basis points.
Its right hand, Gianni Letta, had obtained" expressed however as "heavily of the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion danger out of direction Ireland.
"The good message is that Italy, the third economic system of the Eurozone is not," like Greece or Ireland.
"The bad novelty is, that Italy such as Portugal is," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson institute.
In the clear text, that is named is, its problem the Absenz of economic growth and the therewith walking, consumptive tax entrances that put the country in danger to be able to cover its financing requirement no longer.
That prognoses last Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
In the future an Italian growth will become of 1.1% in 2011 and of 1.4% in 2012 expected... although the household budget existing at the senate to the test reckons with 1.3% or 2%.
Under these prerequisites, calculates the EU commission, becomes the budget deficit in the next year yet 4.3% of the GDP settle (contrary to that of the governments of predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Therefore also the riot around a new household collective, that after the holidays to a sum by 7 billion Euro used become could.
"If compel, must new savings measures seized become," means accountant Olli deer.
To the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The reason festivals of Italy economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, that repeat we already for some time time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the international monetary fund who is entrusted in the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment gives it no problems, neither on short-term, yet on long-term visibility, there of Italy in spite of its high indebtedness of (119.2% the GDP in 2011, A. d. R). slighter Stabilisationsfortschritte demanded become than of other countries," observes pi Carlo Padoan, boss economist of the OECD.
That remains ask about the political unsteadiness.
On the 14th of December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a mistrust proposal of the delegate chamber, preferred organizes become could that as a result of those choices already the end of March.
A little favorable period is forthcoming therefore for a decree with respect to a heavy crisis.
Europeans think about the extension of the antique lawn measures
Christine Lagarde specifically had emphasized it yet yesterday in the frame of a press conference in Paris: "I believe still has, one it on Sunday afternoon as well as also in the evening proved: The Europeans hold together unambiguously, are ready and engages to defend its currency as well as its currency zone."
Although perfectly relative - the deduction indicated yesterday in the interests rates of the European country bond water was on the mill of the governments as well as the EZB.
Of a normalization start, not yet the speech can be however.
The Rating agency standard & Poor's it had announced, could it the guilt memo of Portugal, that reduce probably most effective target of the speculator nowadays.
"How in May insists a honest lack of clarity and political perceptibility, that especially on the bank systems weighs," so the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, that are well aware themselves both this crevice and the danger, that hides therein, intensify the discussions to the strengthening of the already available antique lawn measures.
The informal consultation between the most directly concerned Treasury Ministers and in the further sense with its opposites of the G20 precede well.
And this also in regard on the sessions of Eurogroupe and Ecofin beginning next week.
The EZB meets today.
On the plan, the lot of the unorthodox measures to the back strengthening of the countries of the Eurozone in the crosshair of the markets (see below) stands.
What concerns the EU stability funds, began its executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour its Asia tour in order to inform the investors in the far east about the developments with respect to the crisis in Europe.
If goal Fundraising not specific its visit to be sure is, it prepares this in addition certainly the grounds.
The first who paper editions on the part of the EU stability fund are planned for next month.
Yesterday an official American representative of the agency had entrusts Reuters, supported mobilized the United States a possible climb of that through the additional, direct engagement of the IMF fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in first row, send themselves on their part on, structural reforms to receive especially in the area of the labor market organization.
Reforms that arrive to the savings measures, however effects in the nearer future show should.
Follow Lisbon and Madrid another way when these did Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other lies to every price on that to avoid to have to request international aid position before they set up its own budget correctives and concluded over indispensable structural reforms, that back brings them permanently the confidence.
The European investors again converse over the options standing to the decree in order to accelerate the normalization process of the markets by government bonds.
The idea Axel weaver, who was on the passage in Paris on the 24th of November, had produced firster that if the 750 of billions mobilized by Europe and the international monetary fund Euro would not be enough, the union would not hesitate to grasp again into the own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with respect to the market of the European country indebtedness entirely in the foreground standing participant, judge, would suffice an extension of about 100 billion Euro, "preferably" in form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means exists: the mechanism European of remunerated finance stabilization that amounts to currently 60 billions of Euro.
To be examined an adviser who has all chances, attentively in the European capitals.
Above all, if the market conditions become acute.

According to Météo France, the intensive snow showers affect snows the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it easily on the et Ile-de-Frances.
In the concerned Departements, snow covers are expected of 2 to 5 cm, in places also of 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Parisian region.

The snowfall are notable enough in order to evoke traffic handicap and to impair certain economy activities, predicts Météo France.
In the region Côtes d' equipped are several regional streets for the heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons blocked, under that the traffic Saxons Guingamp lan ion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in the Bretagne is loud the traffic policeman who dissuade therefrom to use the own vehicle only in the emergency, very hard, and the use of some TER coaches became the entire day over painted.
In the Picardie, the school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
For the heavy traffic, on Wednesday evening no specific restricting measures were planned.
The prefecture "demands the drivers to highest caution on the streets as well as to the corresponding adaptation of its driving behavior on."

Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate is around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de-Frances in full gear, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
Call himself herewith especially the 23 billions for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, that by the Société you are supposed to be constructed Grand Paris.
In order to lead the building start of the SGP into the ways, the country a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion exclaimed Euro.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would enable the SGP then to lend on the markets a part of the finance sum to its dual.
Today it came in the end to first projections.
The supplement household of 2010, this morning looked through of the finance commission of the national assembly to raise contains the planned measures, around the first part of these moneys.
It concerns herewith two kinds measures: the creation of a special tax to the Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on that Ile de France.
First, one takes articles 15 of the bill, goes "for the benefit of the publicly legal institute Société you Grand Paris."
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to itself on 117 million Euro per year."
Zweitere is a reorganization of the already existing business taxation: In order around to modernize this, in order to increase that out of its product yielding and to entrust" this increase of the Société you Grand Paris.
How much would bring in that?
A riddle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
Of the 4 billions, one far is removed.
"It is carried out, that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion Euro of the Kapitaldotation added become, that through the country raised become and the Société you Grand Paris gradually for the project performed become," is to be taken the explaining statement.
In the SGP, one finds this system not at all objectionable.
"Since the moment, in which one revenue books (both taxes, d. R.), can one the planning over for three years cover and then first out of the 4 billions take," is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and drawn-off" gradually.
The SGP values that 2013 will be begun to note the 4 billions for that budgets 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions of one yet long will be able to seek, to evoke runs danger, a quite moved, parliamentary discussion.
The first public session takes place on the 7th of December.
Vindictive hackers and busy spies
The affaire WikiLeaks has a dual meaning.
On a side, she turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal, that is solely a scandal in the Sinner sanctimony, that the relation between the countries that reigns citizens and the press.
On the other side, notice gives gives it far-reaching changes on international level on, and a foretaste on the future dominated by regression.
But let's advance according to the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each document generated by a secret service (a x any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cut.
The "extraordinary," American uncovering over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing further from as that, what one got to read for months anyway in every x any journal, (except which, whose owner Berlusconi is), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered already for some time time material for its sketches to cabaret artists.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well known novelties, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and that not not until this century.
If you go into a library, that dedicates itself esotherischen publication, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, the Mysterium of race-le-Chateau, that Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly that, what was written already in prior works.
That does not come alone therefore that the author of occult texts wants to publish no investigation (yet therefore, that he would not know, where novelties over the not existing to find would be), but rather because that that dedicate themselves occultism believe, in nothing unlike that, what it already know and confirms, what they already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of served Brown.
Just as the secret acts.
The informant is is rotten, and rotten (or restricted spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise could he what also always be, for example editor in Libération), that only as true considered, what he acknowledges.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, that had sent the American message in Rome the Staatsdezernat, were that like that, that had published Newsweek already the week before.
Why was therefore such a canceling made around the uncovering of these dossiers?
On a side, these purport what each formed person already knows, and to be sure that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then also the heads of the government itself mutually call can or an airplane take can, around itself to the supper to encounter - lost its diplomatic function and changed themselves, with exception of some small representation task, in espionage centers.
Every any spectator of ascertainment film knows this very exactly, and it does not happen out of sanctimony that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly, the task of the sanctimony injures and serves in addition to set the American diplomacy into a bad light.
At second place: The idea that a x any hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, rescues the considerable blow against the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
Moreover the scandal brings fewer the victims, than rather the "executioners" in oppression.
But let's dedicate the profound nature its, what happened to us.
Formerly, to Orwells times, one was able to bundle all power such as a Big Brother, that each gesture of its subjects controlled.
Orwells prophecy would have since then as perfectly correct turn out can where one can control each movement thanks to the telephone, each handled transaction, the visited hotel, the selected freeway and so further; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of the power.
If one went himself however before eyes, what expires today that even the secret crypts of the power can escape no longer the inspection of a hacker to be arranged hears the control gear up, unilaterally and becomes circle-shaped.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selects as an avenger of the citizen -, can bring the secrets of the power in experience.
How can a power hold itself however, that is no longer in a position, to preserve its own secrets?
It agrees, Georg Simmel said already that an actual secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret never revealed can become); it is also aware that jedwede knowledge of is the character Berlusconis or Merkels in the reason a secret free of Geheimis, there it the public sphere exposes; but in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob it each power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, on the other hand however Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this insult be, that such a powerful power was added?
It is obvious that the countries in the future will place no reserved information more Online - that would become a notice glued on at the street corner match.
But it is just as obvious that it to hope forgiven is with the current technologies secretly to be able to hold confidential reports on telephone.
Is nothing more simply than to find out whether and when a head of state moves away himself in an airplane and contacted one its colleagues.
How could private and only for certain ears certain relations be maintained in the future?
I know very probably that my prediction in the moment sounds Rome fastened after Science Fiction and, but I see compelled myself in addition to imagine the government agents, myself on secret type and manner busily on uncontrollable march routes moving, its communications nowhere unlike in the bare memory with itself carrying, and in addition the few written information that got it, in the shoe paragraph concealing.
The information would be stored had in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempts of Watergate less success to indicate, than a WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology yelled at before nowadays like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, reconstructs the Internet a telegraph with (by telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to scout a film volume for volume in that one was able to ventilate spool and all secrets of the assembly of behind forwards, while the (numeric) CDS enables nowadays nothing other, when from chapter to chapter to jump, therefore in macro portion.
With the high speed trains, one goes Rome to Milan within three hours from while this requires three and a half hours per airplane including the changing.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology return on car and horse.
A last observation.
To understand tried the press in earlier times, what were forged for secrets between the messages.
The messages, that demand confidential information of the press, are present it.
Climate: like France its finance promises beautiful speaks
It is a year after the resident of Copenhagen contract time to examine the compliance of the quickly solved financing promises (also "almost start" or premature financings named), realizes became that by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French Schönredereien are uncovered.
With the resident of Copenhagen contract, the developing countries promised in addition to allocate 30 billions of dollar between 2010 and 2012.
The EU promised 7.2 billions of Euro over three years away, France 1.26 billions of Euro (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU pulled all indices to convince around its partners of the fact of its engagement regarding the almost-starts-financings: detail loyal action report of its members states, press conference, large Nebenevents, pamphlet distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkably and just for its actual value appreciated: the self-developing countries and the civil company would see developed made it gladly, if everyone countries that on the same precision level.
The EU announces to have released in 2010,2.2 billions Euro, what brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its engagement of 7.2 billions per years 2012.
If one looks however into the detail, the things lie a little complicated.
This money should be according to the resident of Copenhagen contract "new and additional" in order to guarantee that an additional use was brought in, without to the disadvantage of the public economic aid to passed.
Unfortunately there is no consent about that, what means "newly and in addition."
While the EU commission had proposed a harmonization, have certain member countries, under that France that blocks procedure.
Today every selects the guideline that it considers as best.
The EU commission chose itself for example as a guideline for that of the year 2009: the international financings are retained, and "almost start" gives in the frame of the financing over for three years 150 million in addition.
Other countries selected similar guidelines, either with respect to year or regarding conditions on plain of the public economic aid.
In return in addition France of the opinion, the financings of "all new projects" of the year 2010 was would be "new and additional."
Differently expressed: There are no guidelines in the editions of the preceded year or on more globally plain of the public economic aid.
Concretely said can the entire sum the French support the developing countries stably remain (or also decrease) - France gives before to keep its obligation with respect to the "new and additional" financings.
Another, decisive element is the breakdown in contributions and loan.
About that yet no rule rules, and everyone selects its rake mode.
Some, like for example France, find 1 lent€as equivalent with 1 contributed€.
This is obvious only heavily justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loan can be justified for certain profitable investments (often at the emission checking bound projects, that on most effective technology be based), to present is it deceitfully, the Euro, that one as equivalent for a contributed Euro collects... Moreover only the costs of the loan should be credited for the investor country as an engagement (i.e. that equivalent an interest rate).
But France has nothing differently in the sense as the following consideration: it "respects" its obligation of 420 million Euro in that it receives 91.5% loan (389.8 millions Euro) and 8.5% contributes) 36.1 million Euro) - see also the EU document in order to convince itself.
France is the single country of the EU that loan uses in large mass.
Germany demands 46% while Denmark that investigate Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) its obligations to 100% with contributions.
Differently said if the predominant majority of the European Union 1 issues€to the fulfillment of its obligations, gives France just once 10 cents and understands under that a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in everything operates France in its almost-start-financing with a double vertigo: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time away and to the other part with reality of the financial use.
France succeeds issued has and saves it let believe, that it 420 million "more newly and in addition" millions in agreement with its promises at the same time 36.1 million Euro.
Does the manipulation of the treasury (there it probably seem, that it Bercy was, that the arbitrage carried out has) could stretch a doubly negative effect after; once EU internally (why go the other member countries with the contributing away, if it yet sufficed to lend)? and then in the negotiations, there the self-developing countries not completely deceive let...
The chapter of the premature financings only a small question on relatively short time in comparison with the entirety at discussions over the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
How that also always would be, to learn it is inevitable, its lesson from this first year of premature financings.
Primarily France could announce a change in its booking type for the years 2011 and 2012, and to be sure in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all however France could bring the discussions over the dispute object of the long-term financings forwards (another, decisive and momentarily discussed subject): one does not escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the booking type of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be just as progressive with respect to the issue how it is that in other things.
The hope is based therefore upon the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement over the almost of start France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the utilization of loan would raise inherently the international confidence basis, that is necessary for continuing discussions.
Alarm - of children taken in pesticides
A child of 10 years takes in published 81 different chemical substances over the day, so one this Wednesday of the union Générations future (former movement to the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations) study.
The union that explains that its results "in view of the slight amount at analyzed samples no statistically significant value represent, but rather illustration character of the treated problematic nature represent," had bought between July and September that usually within four, of an approximately ten-year-old child to the meals consumed groceries plus a between meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - inclusive of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit part and fruit part, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - became just as as examines Naschereien of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutant.
The plate balances is shattering: 81 chemical substances, under that 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenically classified and five as karziogen certain classified, just as as 37 substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence, according to studies of several institutions such as for example the international cancer research center.
"Even if in the approximate entirety of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken in substance not exceeded become, takes one this elevation yet very good, that reality, in which the consumer possibly carcinogenic materials or substances with Endokrinin disruptive influence stopped becomes, apprehension exciting is," notes the union.
Already in the breakfast, alone the butter and the tea with milk contain already more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three certainly as carcinogenically proved, just as as more than twenty residues, that can impair the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil when between meal planned for the study, shows traces by six chemical substances, under that a fungicide forbidden in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, in the lunch included, with which the study traces of an insecticide exertally forbidden in the EU assessed.
Furthermore also the hack steaks, the tuna out of the can, even the Baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical materials g sharp thrilling were.
In the tap water, the analyses brought the presence of nitrate and chloroform at the light.
In the supper, the salmon steak with 34 was determined, was chemical residues at the "abundantest," and itself the plastic plate related for warming up the meal in the microwave not unencumbered.
That in conclusion risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "probably will undervalue," so the study.
The "Alliance Europes Ecologie harvest Verts" (I / O LV) proposed on their part "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium over the use of pesticides, in order to stop the "increase at diseases of civilization."
In July a study of the European authority had identified identified for food safety (EFSA) of reference on the presence of residues 365 more differently, in fruit and vegetable pesticides, that are consumed in Europe, under that 76 in grains.
