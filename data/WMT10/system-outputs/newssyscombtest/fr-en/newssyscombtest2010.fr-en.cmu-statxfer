The lack of snow in the mountains, however - the hotel
The roads are deserted is not the issue that the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow is a disincentive for people to book their visits to ski in hotels and pensions.
To, and it is always possible to trace chambers free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits on our site.
Internet users walk offers, asking prices, but dare not engage in reserve for the moment.
And if they require, they immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, " said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl. Info.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, is much more reluctant to respond.
If give priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation is that we try to wait a few days.
The Hotel Špindler proposes to stay a week for the New Year.
I think they will try even a moment of the place, but they will make way for themselves and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of chambers free will quickly reduced, ” said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of the two also proposes still beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas us most at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of Chambers in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few stays Christmas last-minute cheaper, ” said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The tourism agency of the two may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but the extra places.
The 14 days of February go as well, stays hivernaux remaining sell medium.
This year, interest in stays winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
The people expect it to get to fall.
Nobody wants to move the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, “ think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five per cent.
We still have few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There are a great interest in the holidays of January of Polish and February sells well too, " informed Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the parking lot central Jánské Lázně is also full to 80 per cent during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel of Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty per cent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest in stays in the Krkonoše grows certainly still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
Thursday, it will be more costs and precipitation, they should be neigeuses mountain.
But the time should warm up, informed Jiří Jakubský station Hradec Institute hydrometeorological Czech.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the effort hard with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he regarded himself as well.
When he eventually leave perspiration its doctrine ardently expected, it has proved that it had recopiée paper from the scenario Iraqi Bush to three years.
Not content to use in the text several times the expression " as in Iraq, it has not hesitated to use the title of the speech Bush's January 2007 as part of its own speech: “ A new road ahead ”
At the same time, he personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in an Iraq burned out by the civil war as “ irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences. ”
The months have shown that the Bush strategy, which was the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success that newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, it said, objectively speaking, he has left his successor a final position much more favourable than we might hope.
Barack Obama's hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It is again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, which has even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
It called 40 000 in order to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but for want of a better option, at least it has defrauded the general of 10,000.
He managed to root out the promise of 5,000 additional from Europe, even if there was on 10,000.
This is more problems throughout the strategy Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the military in Afghanistan within 18 months and complete the whole process within three years. Any doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader daily depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain just window-dressing behind which will proliferate ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by the influence of Pakistani and Iranian.
Even the foundation of a “ quick to act ', which is the aim of exercise, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy Obama was perplexed by his proactive approach.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and the reality can be confident that the small soldiers in the turmoil of the war for their “ prompt return to the house ” will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will regard as the confession indirect of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that Europeans want to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving to negative.
The European political can neither do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can alter the situation dramatically is the development of events linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the enhanced penalties have no impact on Iran, the American will be presented with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
Need to respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will, however, a reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, should it prove to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
Employees leaders senior of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year of bonuses in cash.
The company announced to respond to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, that they will not sell within five years.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited in the Castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which reports its stay in government because of its disagreement with the State budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
Estimated budget and perhaps also the position of Janota to Cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the public finance crisis.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss his office Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget to be submitted to the signature of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased reward staff, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused proposals of social democrats that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left the Government, Klaus and right on the other, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as it was voted by Members, removes the package of measures savings past by the government of Fischer and which must that contain the debt of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget, but that there was nothing to do so, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long neglected the “ serious problem ” of the “ disability irréfrénable ” of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution in favour.
Only a strong government could contribute to an improvement, could be based on a consensus of political parties, according to the president.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, DOS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer has described such words “ verdicts drastic ”.
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion.
Wednesday, the ČSSD called a success the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People's Party also was happy.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood

I had no other purpose if not play this role in order to bring most of the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was of course to speak with him
The actor said that if he and the politician International were in the same region, it would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, the scenes before his speech.

I realized that when you hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.

The mystery of the will in Norway is determined: the Russian tested a rocket
There had been a phenomenon luminous strange of unknown origin above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket ballistic intercontinental near the borders in Norway.
The launch has still been a failure, and the missile “ Bulava ” that was originally due to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated in the test of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava did not boom, or it was damaged in flight.
The newspapers Russian speak of " Bulava ” and “ missile that is not “
A missile that is not is
This 13th test took place at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight that again damage on the apparatus.
That is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, ” Bulava ” was soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which travelled under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can rightly be set on fire in a boat in movement and submerged
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the probably by a “ Bulava “ defective.
Moreover, the Norwegian have no doubt that it is a rocket Russian.
The generals argue that this time, there may be absolutely failure.
The two first rocket stages have resisted and damage affected only the third.
In previous cases, the drivers have been failures on the first floor.
Even if no launches test happened smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six on thirteen have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills therefore general of optimism, and therefore always that one day ” Bulava “ fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclei nuclear hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the plant Hyundai of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is because overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of strike emergency Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai confirmed.
The management does get agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year.
We cannot renounce our plan of production, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička 1605 indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 CZK employees that would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded also has afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask leave replacement on 28 December and extend their end of year holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the cost of transport and for their lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most urgent and warmer in the comments and the demands of the trade unions and employees who have ceased spontaneously production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight hours.
The unions are cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The negotiation between the management and the unions the Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike in the event of agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers were spontaneously on strike because of overtime.
They were protesting against the poor pay and alleged hazing.
Management defended herself with the fact that employees should work in addition to fulfil the requirements of production of cars.
During the announcement of the strike Monday, trade unions have also called for the employees who have ceased production are not subjected to any sanction.
The unions are calling for society to reduce the time spent in overtime.
Moreover, they want this year a processing fee of 5 million (209 about €) for them.

It has produced around 80 000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Exploring Czech: a substance that works on the HIV virus ” hard-working people ” also
A team of scientists Czech and German is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This is, in some cases, head to the fact that the combination is not as hard on variants of viruses as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
It may extend radically the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The abuse, however, entails a series of side effects.
The suppression of this proliferation is responsible for the development of so-called virus resistant on which drugs have more impact.
The Group of experts three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a response to HIV resistance.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are a collection of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of mechanics molecular connectivity on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a structure three-dimensional single: two cages to multiple walls are trained by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by an atom metal, in this case cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The protease HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protease HIV there would be no birth of particles infectious mature.
If we stop the protease HIV will also establish the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, say researchers in a press release published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work is published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cage (see table) were connected by a short link organic, which was then systematically amended.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases of HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on medicines clinics, however it is not diminishing versions resistant against which the common medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their mechanism of action single and their other properties as their stability biological and chemical, their low toxicity and the possibility of other amendments are therefore combinations interesting to consider more towards the development of drugs effective against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the biology laboratory structural of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. The ODS is Fischer defends
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) , Mirek Topolánek has referred to as “ appalling ” the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The first minister called the ODS of verdict drastically.
It said take time to analyse.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, DOS and the Green Party didn clearly more.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or whether it was concerned to serve with the assistance of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problems of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, with the proposed amendments to 12 billion included by the left.
The Chamber has increased the money for salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The claim of government to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion.
The ODS left the meeting before the vote, obeying the wishes of the Government that a budget is a variant least bad that a budget.
Déception and unnecessary
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
According to the Television Czech, Janota has made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after its passage to the government:
It reported at the same time that he wondered whether he will remain in office.
His disappointment in the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed the change of the budget, have no place in government.
The prime minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Mr Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
That is the case of the Head of Government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, stressed Topolánek in a communiqué textual since the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries to OPT 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decided to resign at the fact to fight the amount of the deficit, " it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House. ”
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance for Democrats.
I have not considered and once again will be on the agenda then I will focus, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that DOS would probably have voted Wednesday against the budget changed if it had not specifically called on Democrats to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not feel to be orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether DOS had not been accusations by the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of everything that there were positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new hours of the ČD fewer trains for the same charges.
Czech Railways will prohibit or limit since 13 December some express trains or regional than others and will strengthen the contrary others.
The full coverage of transport will decline to date of entry into force of the new hours of two per cent compared to today.
Most of the tariffs will not change, including the tariffs and the reduced cost.
These are, for example the inhabitants of the region in Ostrava who will have more links to the capital, Railways will add a rowing pendolino.
On the contrary, a Express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
Regionally, the largest decline in transport to the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent in total, however Prague and its surroundings may welcome a rise.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will amount to only a few days in the week.
Among the most major changes, we can see the introduction of a new hotline Milovice in Prague: for the time being the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line suburban Esko which is possible through the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines distant to the capital will have their final destination at the station main Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží) .
The ČD will introduce more of SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will leave by two hours.
Passengers will no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year to regional railways: 200 million.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion to address the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains were ordered by the regions who will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will be worth almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price rise of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and notes Internet at reduced prices eLiška.
For passengers without card reduction, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the miles, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region choice and was at a rate of 160.

The history of South Africa to everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new film Hollywood of Clint Eastwood in the rooms American in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title was Invictus: Neporažený) , and narrae part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid known returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
For its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1915 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he obtained the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
It has been President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations as it is presented at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are woven by disturbing news about the increase of racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority.
According to the agency PA, reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where “ pavanent ” stars Hollywood.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of that role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met Nelson Mandela for power, as it were, recover its energy, he said at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that is a good thing if we have the possibility to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but that each individual Has added.
Porter the jersey of the national team rugby
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room who gave his creation to the people depicted the defender South African human rights during his term of the presidency.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying during the film to pick up two racial groups of the population long divided and that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the jersey national team South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, that South Africa had won.
In order to be shown on the lawn in a swimming, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been extensively cheered fourteen years mainly public white and was recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the Football Championship will be able to unite people again as a nation, said the player rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only “ black ” of the national team.
It remains to see if the situation South Africa tense will improve.
The South African white, however, are sceptical as recently in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby that has fled to Britain.
The tournament begins on 11 June 2010.

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of kroner, the exact figure is over once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed will be replaced by a nine.
She added that in ten years of work, the society Čeps had known nothing of similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Supplies into electricity have not stopped, said the spokesman of society ČEZ for Bohemia North Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry had not been influenced by the fire station transformation.
A. seconds. Čeps is the operator exclusive on the Czech territory sets of transmission and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.

Jančura will sue for defamation against three commissioners of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will testify today defamation complaint against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of Moravia, South against Radko Martínka of the region Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of society to exploit regional railways in some regions.
All regions did eventually sign long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three had attacked us and say that we made the thin lips, while there has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways signed last week.
So it is only to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura in Radiožurnál.
Similarly, it reported evidence that no region has taken in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaints of Mr Jančura represents his media spectacle that provides free publicity for its society and for himself.
I am of course ready to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura handling public opinion and used arguments false and misleading on rail transport, said Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million in advertising that the approaches unfavourable regions.
He has said to Radiožurnál that it will stop the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
It reported that the campaign will target the corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech Railways exploitation of rail connections for about $150 billion kroner, without bidding.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we did not cease, could lose our licences bus.
It was presented as a Member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines will overturn the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccine against pneumococcal vaccines to peak.
The institute pharmaceutical already defines the the maximum prices that will pay for health insurance.
Specialists are also clear in the process.
A new vaccination.
Vaccines free for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be given free of charge against pneumococcal vaccines.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we began vaccination last year or earlier, it will have to pay oneself vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Just last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcal vaccines.
Yet parents pay 1600 SEK or more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Analysts believe that every year the insurance spends 300 to 450,000 in doses of vaccine.
They are saving, however, on medical care that children not vaccinated would require.
So far the State spends an estimated 500 million per year for any child immunization.
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the package Janota ”.
The pneumocoques are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including the inflammation of the meninges and poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections of pneumocoques.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There are views regarding a possible compulsory vaccination in the future.
From January, it should be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example the chairman of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His Association promotes long vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
At an international conference to which our association participated, experts have not been really pleased that we have a vaccination optional.
This is not ideal.
On the other side, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines.
We are looking absolutely not for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Vaccination optional has its disadvantages, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledged that vaccination based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, could be considered a decline renewals of vaccinations “ In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional “ said, however, Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal vaccines marks a break also that this is the first vaccination, which is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, conserving the authorities and possible future medical care.
The doctors will need to buy their products themselves
This was linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners, related to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to make vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the State.
Members were concerned, however, that this would allow the assurances of “ deduct are health insurance ”.
Thus, doctors will need to buy products and expect the assurances their reimbursement.
According to estimates, paediatricians must individually invest nearly 40 million per month in vaccines, which is a large sum.
That will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Also them and us
Islam can be French?
The pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the last book, “ Why the French do not like the headscarf ” (2006) , a stylish and well documented on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen present a much broader and more ambitious.
Well anthropologist, it not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say on Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutions that provide now in France this great eloquence. Bozen calls “ spaces Muslims ” for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well listen and replicate the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both) ?
The development and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are the practical problems, he says, which is the daily lot, rather than the political concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of priests, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a Islam French or European.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally consistent with their counterparts a Islam Sunni purist associated with Saudi Arabia which today are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be reached with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to compromise history with the Republicanism secular.
Rather than a pragmatic growing, it detects a “ narrow key values ”.
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say ' yes, but not yet. ”
The view the darkest of the world
The Arctic changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice that the membership is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, shipments and fishing sail in new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In “ On a thin layer of ice ”, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of Northern, the polar bear.
Connaisseur of history and complicated political of whaling, he describes the long tradition of explorers of the Arctic that were their evidence by chasing the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 who had to fight that the tip of his musket-shape, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons, captured who were swimming with their mothers, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous brought together 75 ours.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary to an adult. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae which in its fur thick.
Click here for more information.
Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Indians Inuit in motoski use fusilsd'assaut powerful to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters the most north of these two nations of the hunting that ice will remain as long.
In his new book, “ After the ice ”, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear and frightening of science of the Arctic and an overview exciting of what may be the future there.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the marine scientists can tell the exact speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
At the nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave initial information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped change of relief sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes on the icebergs are of great assistance, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson, looking at the world special and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing.
But the bear above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, between 2013 and 2050.
“ In a few months, perhaps our turn “
The Marines of the 6,000 people who have wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a trip to seven hours by bus to a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who have travelled Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina in Cimetière Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to welcome of men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, which we will be sent, we are likely to be in their place, said Robinson on the fallen soldiers.
If that happens, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try just to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, in Maine, launched the commemoration and other people have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the voyage, stopping in various cities on their way to organize commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (SEK across America, which aims to promote the event in the other States.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves in the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial for the victims of the flight 93 of United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more de$150 million to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip in Arlington in honour of her husband, a military career.
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this was a way to thank those who died.
It is a small gesture that can make civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visit a tomb family.
Emmitouflée in several sectors of warm clothing, volunteers have market between the lawns and the hills swathes of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen graves old, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, since they are not as often visited that new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples holding hands, on the crowns of pine costs on the graves grey.
Each crown table had a colour green darker, with a little bow tie red on the top.
Not far, hung over the silence on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 to decorate section but the mood against the current wars filled the area.
People were screaming without hiding, other requested and families and friends conspired in cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small cards information black and white, got itself into a wetland for falls had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to pray at the tomb of the Sergeant of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, death in combat in July.
No one should never forget through what we are libres… my son has paid for it, she said.
" Long after I have disappeared, I want someone would remember him. ”
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who disseminated mobile phones and laptops in the country, claimed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. , based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations have not been made public, although under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors may be arrested under the pretext of “ dangerous ”.
All activities so-called revolutionary, including protests moderate and critical writings, lead to arrest.
The graffiti anti-governmental and speeches are classified as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers growing, led by Yoani Sánchez, lead discussant popular writing often on the husband and she followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go receive rewards but authorisations have always been refused.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tension between the Communist government brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration with a " soft " in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by practical steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
The mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although consumer goods and new desired in a country or the average wage of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a conversation of 15 minutes a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some buildings of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, press officer to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
One activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- provide free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the programme Americas group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report severe on freedoms in Cuba, called “ New Castro, even Cuba ”, referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his elder brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the US, at the time the two countries are beginning to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Virginia North in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that the case would remove a significant network of terrorist recruiting offices scouring the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators have said that they were hunting a personality insurgente hidden, known as the Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them commented approving the waves terrorist on the site of video YouTube on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah which tried to help them to join the remote region of the belt tribal of Pakistan, the home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret services of Pakistan which was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders al-Qaeda that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
That is, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the mountains prohibited north-east become a refuge of terrorism.
They have been seen as undercover agents.
That is why they have been rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they are still trying to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain entry in the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of law of Pakistan.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people in that trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have prioritized to infiltrate men in the network al-Qaeda.
The recruiters organization play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those that may prove to be spies.
Analysts, recruits American potential are monitored closely by al-Qaeda.
But they also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Foundation NEFA based in the US, said that terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that other people have already? said Kohlmann.
The model is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen are calling for a “ action ” for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for a more important on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 as estimated by the police.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of activists masked has lit a few explosives near a set of Government buildings, in centre- city.
On the day that little has happened during the discussions on the climate law by the United Nations, thousands of activists have market by the city, deploying banners in English saying ' every one is no planet B ” and one in Spanish, saying " The Earth said that it has enough ”.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the country home of his mother, Peru, has opened their eyes to harrowing facing the country because of the impact sustainable changes that are already taking place. ”
That is one reason why I decided to join the big march -- to get the word and appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and engaged, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground wearing a mask or were in possession of knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground wearing a mask or were in possession of knives.
According to a passer-by who has asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in discussions on the climate, the activists who masks and clothing black, sparked several explosives near the principal conduit in Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were almost buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by " a few big explosions ”.
The inside of the Palais des Congress, people were gathered around television screens to monitor throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to wake up the conscience of the authorities key such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English “ is something that I did not realise it.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring " The event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside. ”
He observed that the march could seem negative or useful according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, ' you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or they are damaging to the freedom of others. ”
The test results show differences persistent between races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has made good news for public schools in Washington DC.
Although the District is still far behind the institutions of the head, the report showed that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far greater progress over the previous two years that in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what comes out of the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (Evaluation national progress of education) is the persistent gap between the performance of African American and white, both local and national.
The results means of white children of Grade 4 (CM1) to WashingtonD. C. have increased during the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500, but those of their classmates African American women increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has in fact increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only, 245 to 244.
The result means of white has not been included in the results of tests because the sample was not enough.
The overview on a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1) , when the first report NAEP District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202) .
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during that period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of schools Michelle A. Rhee and the local mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have the aggregate in recognizing the elements at senior level, which is a problem and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a group non-profit which promotes equality in education in the District.
I is not immediately evident joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related, Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (primary) .
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the 3-plus (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
The fear is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges) .
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, designed the pupils of end of elementary school and early college that had not incorporated the foundations of reading earlier in their education and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics, for grades Kindergarten (tongue) to Grade 6 (6) focuses on games and experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better response to these students to level below that of the class, said Rhee.
Others feel that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less to reduce the gap.
That is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California that studied the results of tests of cities.
The political solution treaty is to devote your resources and your management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other Superintendant schools, it is trying to use of the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus for the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools districts in order that all families, regardless of the place of origin, be assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of public school traditional today of 180 days in the District of Washington, D.C., to be in competition with the Charter schools.
Must be about 200 days to change, said Janey, which has come to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year to obtain 185 days, which it considers a “ starting point ” to obtain a further increase in the next contract.

The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long sifflement.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, in descend and cligne a time eyes at the sight of columns white, facades of bricks and lawns green pastures.
The parents of Graciela had only able to complete high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So, when she and other students of Grade 8 (4th) of the group have explored Gettysburg where fees are of $38 690 per year, his attitude was less a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super That is where I shall study! noted Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide the transition to the entry of the building of science.
Youpi, ? said it food for thought when he noted the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university.
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widely for the large number of American children born to immigrant parents Hispanic who have left the high school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to university education which will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, ” a Hispanic “ second generation ” on cinqpoursuit its high -- a significant achievement when you consider that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way for subsequent generations will play important roles in the workforce of the country.
The researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and a need innate to succeed.
Many also whose parents set targets high to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programmes are also very important roles to help Graciela and millions of children as it to get to university -- in particular, if its efforts are steady, long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, which has studied the Latin American students.
We must think to provide a support network for these children from kindergarten through to high school.
The federal programme which funded the visit universities Graciela is a good example.
Known as the name of ERG UP (prépares you) , it provides more than $300 million a year of local schools to organize the programmes at the university who start when students of families on low incomes are in middle school (College) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering higher education, according to the United States Department of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi oil received agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns on violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract oil companies important to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play major roles in the rehabilitation of the oil industry in Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The United States companies left with participation in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The one who had an auction has lost.
Two companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of giants American oil in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, were of Asian companies and European paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer must be made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroborated by bombing coordinated massive Tuesday, and political instability while troops American military withdrawal have hampered the American companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq that has the third largest oil reserve gross of the world, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, are disadvantaged by their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and more ready to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The United States companies most important, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and provided their technical advice, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and left with substantial ownership in contracts for two fields.
We all know that China is becoming an economy, as well as a technological strength, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Companies pré-sélectionnées to submit auctions have made offers that were then compared with the price per barrel for the ministry agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each.
One of the main organizers al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile have struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda, this week, said Friday the United States authorities counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles in their cars, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to sources American and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, in the border tribal anarchic of Pakistan.
They drove a car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the secret services civilians of Pakistan, speaking on the telephone to Miran Shah.
The authorities have said that local activists suspects fled into place and quickly confiscated which remained “ body totally blown to pieces ”.
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives anti-terrorist American gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Responsible organizers military al-Qaeda who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the region Afghanistan-Pakistan.
Its role was to hold plots in the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this included probably of conspiracies of attacks against the US and Europe.
It followed the instructions strategic leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known of the great American public, but that did not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the belt tribal, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks by unmanned planes of the CIA has declined since the summer, about six operations a month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site moderate by a group non-profit.
The decline may be due to tactics improved terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly informants suspected, says the site.
The United Nations special envoy in Kabul withdrew
The United Nations special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a mandate tumultuous marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
Envoy of the United Nations said that he supported the increase but has expressed its concern regarding the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The diplomat Norway also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that it did not resign but that it would respect the commitment to his family, in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows now that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacing said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months from the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been mentioned; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously headed the peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of a massive vote fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations but said that the accusations of Galbraith - which has been thanked -- " have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions ”.
Eide said that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
It also urged leaders of the United Nations to his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them greater confidence on how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed frustration over the limits of power in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of employment of the United Nations interfered with its possibilities for new talent.
United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it may not last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would impose “ additional sanctions important ” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit of a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things that I weighs most, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it is the side unpredictable inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military elite and policy of Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that " a set of incentives and punishments ” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government could be less security with nuclear weapons ” because " its people would suffer énormément'.
Friday, in a statement of White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences “ likely ” if it does not reduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) .
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its experience nuclear solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks, on 1 October, it indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, means of developing a confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be removed attempts to agreement, in part, say experts, because leadership is divided on the fact to engage with the US.
Frankly, I think the inflexibility of Iran in response to some of the proposals of the international community in which they had in fact agreed in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional sanctions important against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “ increased penalties ”.
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls “ unfounded allegations ” of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it has agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “ in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ”.
Gates, who had to return to Washington late on Friday, met with morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to derencontrer the Responsible troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions remain between the Kurds and the majority Arab in Iraq, particularly on borders, property rights and the sharing of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 by the end of August.
Gates would also ease the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal outstanding. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “ We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within Iraq unified ”.
We will not abandon you. ”
In China ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster propaganda the lecturing, “ The earth mother is too tired to accommodate more children ” and “ A baby in more, a fall more. "
They so well learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique stayed with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed " small emperor ”, a crisis of the population threat the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, although it is projected that the number of residents aged 60 and above will shoot up, 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in urban rich coastal with a population of highly educated, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less of a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission Population Municipale of Shanghai and Family Planning) has said that couples fertile should have babies to ' help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a shortage of in the future ”.
Shanghai is about to become “ too old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden ”, she said.
Less progressive
Prepared in the country's constitution in 1978, Chinese policy is to date, without question, the obligation most controversial introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy might have to pay fines colossal -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of human rights have condemned the abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority has forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
Moreover, many couples have used selective abortion leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have devoted more exceptions to the rule including – for residents of towns, the members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already children unique -- and in 2007 they have softened many of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute research population) , Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government recently discussed changes even more radical, such that allowing couples to have two children if one partner has a single child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer that has the right to have a second child and how to leave.
The Government of the city sent accountable for family planning and volunteers to meet with couples, in their home, and slip leaflets in their backyard.
It has also promised to provide advice psychological and financial those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Answer disappointing
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child after the launch of the campaign, the district more urban reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, continued to receive four to five requests per month.
Officials of Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still being approximately 165,000 -- slightly higher in 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason that many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill in their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they adoreraient have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western view of the misconception that the one-child policy is a matter of rights, said Yang, an engineer in which the woman is seven months pregnant the first child of the couple.
That is true, it is robbing us the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
That is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, human resources, said that it wanted that a single child because it was a itself. ” We were the centre of the family and used that everyone deals with us. ”
We have not used to take care of someone else and do not want to take care of others. ”
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a society translation says it more bluntly.
For couples working to two, middle class, have brought down the birth rate, he said, must be selfish pourbien succeed.
People of 20 or 30 years have grown up watching their parents struggled in the first time China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child time-consuming of his parents, he says.
A mother should give up at least two years of his social life.
May there are problems of space -- ' You need to change your apartment -- and planning -- " When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a spot in the best tongue. ”
Most of his friends are ready to that experience again, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the United Nations -- which had so far by placement disrupted and mutual recrimination -- has returned in the spotlight Friday because of the publication of a document outlining the reductions ambitious of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the next time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as much as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step in negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world coming next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand global warming, and long term.
And it offers a broad range of options on key issues, including how the developed and emerging economies would reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It provides a great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, considered a text of 180 pages to concentrate on what described the Secretary-General Executive on climate change to the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as “ full ”.
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their collective emissions in 2020, 25 to 45% compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent for 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same arguments have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States negotiating climate has rejected any discussion forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration was two years.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern that also expressed regret that the text does not focus enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern has made his comments one hour after the deputy Chinese Foreign He Yafei has said that the principal negotiator American, or lack of “ common sense ”, was “ extremely irresponsible ” for having said earlier in the week that the US would not financially China to combat global warming.
With the economic future of major world powers at stake, defects have emerged within the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The battle is more the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States acrimony on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific need to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to get them legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small States peoples which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Chief of the unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has " put political pressure on the political process ", in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging-market economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, when delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the Heads of Governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and Deputy Minister Chinese took their aircraft and rushed in the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be discussed during the following week.
The image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the conference every day -- activists players guitar entertainment night making fun of countries that to reveal that the proposals are submitted and distributed on paper rather than emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is on the increase: almost all key ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the global policy of Conservation International.
HGVs arrive.
In Britain the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle percera night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first suburban high speed of the country will reach 225 km/h, when it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable, and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
Small holes lost will become cities suburban, periods of business travel will be far less long and the passage of the aircraft and the car at the train will reduce the emission of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network, the battle for planning inevitable and fears of risks for the environment may curb high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2) , a company created in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will enable it to get a detailed map of the route of the next phase for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be comic within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line is will separate in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will run through Scotland.
“ It appears that this will be the best option of performance' said a professional of the railways.
When that is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not begin until 2025, will allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel an hour now.
The proposals will enable the train travel to 400km/h, making the UK the world.
The route initial is designed to allow trains to 400m long and can carry 1100 people.
Until 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London, Birmingham.
A terminal for 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
In data the constraints of space, it is anticipated that a railway station existing will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The experts rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will need to be built party by party.
Trains would primarily be forced to drive out of high-speed lines on track existing in the north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure passage of aircraft trains, as a point of reference for the revolution of the railways.
Taxpayers repay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the main Member of Parliament Tory, made to pay the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of a orangerie that it has built in his house in his constituency.
The head of the party that was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were kept, has increased its loan of 75,000 GBP to build an extension in oak at his second home, Rutland.
It had been authorized to make pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, which control of members ’ expenses. The last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could be " clearer or more simple ”.
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a house in two floors in a village of Rutland, Melton.
The neighbouring houses have been sold for almost £ 1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the office of earnings claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
Neighbours described it as a “ véranda for fun ”.
It was not asked Mr Duncan to give explanations for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of privileges and standards of the Commons, on its provisions of loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation that the rules, after an investigation on its spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal security of borrowing of 271.406 GBP ownership of London to the house of his constituents that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1400 GBP per month interest borrowing up to March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the borrowing of 75,000 GBP.
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, nothing since then.
The latest publication of the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr Duncan continues to be 1 250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan has lost its position, the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in the supposedly filmed stating that the members of parliament should survive ” on budget " after the scandal of expenditure.
“ In fact, it is now national, you have to live " on budget ” and you are treated as “ of the m…e ”
He said: “ I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could demand sacrément more, but I did not do. ”
The member of Parliament, millionaire since his former post as negotiating oil, has begun to have to explain its spending in May, after it emerged he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the costs ” could be considered excessive ”.
A activist has dug a hole in the form of GBP in the lawn of M Duncan, in protest after it was revealed that it had requested 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: " It was for improvements capitals, approved by both the office costs and Legg. ”
He added: “ It is no problem of evasion or of development and use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules allowed, etc.
This could not be clearer and simpler. ”

But in any case it is not, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it works well, told the press David Hallyday off the plane which Paris shortly after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT) .
The son of singer, air relaxed, provided that it would go “ very quickly ” to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation for a hernia discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was " placed in coma artificial night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort to suffer and be able to administer treatment ”, the news service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in coma artificial by doctors from the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation for a hernia discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be réopéré late Wednesday night to Thursday because of significant injury resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the high school French in Los Angeles where school their daughter Jade, to attend a school, found a photographer from AFP.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and sessions hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurochirurgien which the singer on 26 November at the Clinical International of the park Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial process ahead, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus found that Johnny Hallyday was " party much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon Parisian ”.

Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very experienced in the arts.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine of at the time.
In 2007, it had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to clear a haematoma following a brain haemorrhage.

With Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Physicians, accused him of being “ a man unscrupulous ” continued “ regularly ” before the Council, which “ is not the commendable ”.
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.

The operation was “ not haemorrhagic and would not require any the drain ”, he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose trouble health began this summer, seems in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre to use its initials
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to attempted takeover of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym for the ex-parti giscardien being, to stop the use on any support, under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday in the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP happened in NC) claiming ownership of the UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of industrial property.
But Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou that do not intend to let themselves be deprived, is his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and to the honourable Member, requiring them to no longer use the acronym and to transfer ownership of the brand, under threat of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, indicating that you were going to offer your political movement of +reprendre+ the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Mrs de Sarnez the MoDem party, as well as Senator John Arthuis Alliance centrist.
You have also seen fit to follow on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the +Nouveau centre+, the slogan +l'UDF of aujourd'hui+, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this symbol, said the office of the UDF which is the NC to withdraw “ immediately the marking of the UDF of any medium as well as of (its) website ”.
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette ” to transmit the property of (the) marks its legitimate. ”
If are not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their mail, they state that the UDF ” is a political movement in full since 1978 ” and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had “ choice ” to leave in 2007 ” to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP ”.
The New centre has therefore considered that, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French democracy) .
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the MoDem party for three years and the creation of an office to defend " the material and moral interests " training founded by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continues the room, ” when he established the ", it was “ more adherent of the UDF for three years, but in the UMP.
It benefits scandalously and fraudulently of the abscence deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out.
This brutality is being transformed into crime, denounce, prior to mock, on the strategy of the NC: “ It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to be a name at home to try to get out of anonymity taking fraudulently a name which has not right ”.
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre tribunal decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as there is the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the 80-year-old to deprive them of parts of its property.
The photographer for 62 years, known for its photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and 375.000 fine of €.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, where mother and daughter are fracturing while taking the reins of the empire of L 'Oreal cosmetics.
But the 15th criminal court also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L 'Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors designated Friday will be required to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could be weak and time periods.
I think it will submit.
I will speak about it, said outside the hearing the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court decision.
This is good (...) The expertise will demonstrate that it (Mr. Banier) has manipulated her grandmother that must be protected, he said.
For two years, daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touche-à-tout, that it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of grants, in the form of cheques, life insurance or tables of teachers.
The Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, as an old friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, oral arguments lawyers have sometimes turned to naming family Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which it said was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: “ could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage ”.
For its part, the Office of Nanterre has again felt that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a custody court refused in recent days to grant his request to open a process of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt ” has full capacity, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place, ” said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided that it would take action once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fight for the development of intelligence economic has been vain…
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of big business to its employees, said the position of companies to the consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to “ values ” determined from above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by technicians of the plant.
In the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution marketing handed the strategies of conquest of markets in the place. .. although the authoritarian tendencies to impose products away factors preferences of clienteles return regularly!
A demobilization of employees may lead to a demoralization deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a phenomenon much more general which particularly affects the frameworks.
Demobilization seriously affects the development of the intellectual of the company, including R& D and, even more, intelligence economic.
Indeed, l’IE ” requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision ”; it requires by employees a commitment that the revenue management authoritarian are completely.
That is why we are calling for a revolution management to put the staff at the centre of the company along with the client.
The value relative investigations of opinion internal
The investigations of opinion internal –comme the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage them to this revolution in the practices managerial?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
Firstly because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure comes after many detours, to make prioritairement… what it has always done. !
- secondly because authoritarianism –une pathologies of the pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Among the major schools engineers, they have an interpretation mechanistic psychology.
They adopt, by comfort intellectual, the old theory behavioriste, cranked up recently by the “ neuroscience ” American and widely available, without their knowledge, by the institutes studies and the media.
For example, suggesting that it is possible to handle the “ levers ” (sic) of the commitment of managers, a recent survey d’Ipsos published in Le Figaro. reinforces the leaders in governance mechanistic, inappropriate for today ’ s world.
Identifying and measure factors mobilization
Instead, the revolution managerial necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, to adopt a vision members of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the business is possible only if it is clear as a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently only studies from l’Analyse motifonctionnelle adopt this view of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a doxa predetermined that through their image seen of the company, to assess what it offers them to their projects of life.
With identification and the extent of these factors mobilization, business managers can control, and anticipate their “ Social performance " and put their management of human resources ” in the place ”.
They create a breeding ground agreed a good economics robust and effective.
Speech Oslo: " just war " is praise to the right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday the speech the previous day in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had brocardé the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the speech presidential, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency of the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party, daily USA Today, adding have itself raised the issue of war ” sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists all there, it said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the president had done in Oslo “ good job ”.
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives which has particularly the reference to “ the existence of evil in the world ” in the presidential.
For some side, I found the speech wholly historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed in the radio programme, “ The Takeaway ”.
The former elected, regarded by some as a candidate as possible to the inauguration republican for the presidential election in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen a “ leftist ” to remind members of the Nobel Committee ” whether they would not be free and could not put a price if the use of force did not exist ”.
For Michael Gerson, a former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist in the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered “ a very American. ”
In addition to appear in “ citizen of the world ” as it always does ”, “ he talked as a US President, recalling the Europeans ” whether they live in a bubble of security they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, ” said Mr. Gerson.
The rare right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech " dull, ampoulé and without inspiration ” on the site National Review Online.
A left of the President, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When is the war in the concept of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The press centre-left remained flattering to the President.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, has described his address “ superproduction " even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech Oslo ” should serve as a road map to guide the international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression ”, was inflamed the newspaper in California.
Mr. Obama " was delivered the need to ”, the New York Times, deeming it “ both dark and inspiring ”.
Road: three marathons for an agreement which is saving the supply of Christmas
After three meetings of marathon negotiation process, the unions of the road sector and TLF, only employers ' organisation to be remained to the end, arrived Friday evening to an agreement to end the strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures on Friday night, Secretary of State, Dominique Bussereau, was “ pleased ” that agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, begun Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the morning Friday, with the hope of signing rapidly in the late morning the text of agreement.
And even if three employers ' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took another six hours of a meeting that began to 11H00 so that everyone agrees and that 18H00 the text is signed.
The conflict ” would be very damaging for business ” and “ it was feared that it should disrupt the Christmas years ”, said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4 per cent for the lowest salaries (in road transport local and regional) , and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international) .
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, ” is 8.72 euros to 9.06.
That is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO) .
This is it will instruct our activists that there is no blockages, no embargo centres of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of TLF, hailed “ a good agreement ”, although it was “ difficult to concede the rises on the top earners in view of international competition ”.
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed " a historic agreement ”.
Richard Jaubert (CGT) was referred to “ an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses of 3% , and the state general of road transport in the first half of 2010, including addressing the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that “ a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers ' contributions ” has been the subject of an amendment government finance bill corrigendum for 2009, voted in Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote " in identical ".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies initially to companies belonging to that organization, and a second time, to the occupation, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be “ as soon as possible ”, Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employer may only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a “ fool ”, because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax ”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion d? shared analysis, but to avoid antagonizing the eating turkey of the next Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risk ” of digging the grave a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ”.

The disruption on the RER A, the largest line transport urban of France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend procurement before Christmas, there will be trains that between 10H00 and 20H00, a train on two on the section Central (between The Defense and Nation) and a train on four outside of the section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “ the RATP should make efforts to reach stores ”.
The RER A traverse from west to east Greater Paris.
The section RATP short Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated in the peak hours, and almost no rowing in hours empty, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no melee on piers, the Franciliens is being held.
Thus in the morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Baccalaureat) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) , Jack Nbakina, engineer for 29 years, due to be lifted " one hour thirty, be sure to arrive on time ”.
The station Saint-Lazare had not known of saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had planned a framework of agents and police.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to join the Metro.
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will discuss the results, tried lean by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what drivers, which demand a premium, Thierry Garon (South) .
The authority is even its proposals for premium in brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the leadership was “ not kaput to solve a problem while among road and the SNCF is done ”.
A further meeting is planned Monday for " a broader review of conditions from the profession ", said the RATP.
What was also say to the unions that the “ scoffed users over the weekend. ”

The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish, far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court delivered Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the task of the Government, which has just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a “ home of activities prejudicial to the state and its unity indivisible ”, said to the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required to dissolve, Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of party officials, including its President Ahmet Türk and the Member Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and confiscation of the treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (on 550) .
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than serve as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision followed a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP to obey the “ guidelines ” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the window political legal rebels of the PKK.
The party ensures that it has “ no organic ties " with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government has just reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to dry up the support of Kurds in the PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in the south-east Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
From the announcement of justice, 1,000 demonstrators gathered at the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of south-east is a majority of Kurds.
The police fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of Justice would " deepen despair. "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish ndlr) prohibiting a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
That will solve nothing, said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This is a torpedoing total of democratic openness launched by the Government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Can be expected, of course, a reaction of the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly of recent months.
The new " Silicon-valley ”
For a long time it had the reputation of city secret, prohibited to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research arms secret, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km of the centre of Moscow, has the reputation of being the “ Silicon Valley ”.
Important production sites and research into micro and Nanoelectronics are located.
From September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science Mehr Licht – with academic institutions and companies of the centre innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ) .
There were meetings reciprocal and last Wednesday of representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a “ Protocol of close collaboration ”.
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwartz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.
Exchange scientific
It is a scientific exchange sustainable.
But as economic relations.
It will enable companies FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
A contrast companies Russian scientific wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat institutes and companies research Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of electrical engineering in Moscow, the big firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.

Zelenograd (literal translation ' green ') derives its name hills woodland at the core of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
Cannot place high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
For its supporters this is nothing less than “ new heart of Europe ”.
If. S21, it is more that burying a railway station, more than a construction project sterling will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a chaos Using yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations front line, with pathways that correspondence in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technical transport of the 19th century that were effect of low-noise brake of rail traffic modern since it once a long time to put the locomotives back to forward.
Arrival, stop short, departure – that is what to do.
That is why stations front line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a railway station of trains, which is half-way around on the Magistrale Transeuropéenne rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava where the slogan “ heart of Europe ”.
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are more long compatible with reality.
Even planners most ambitious acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations front line no longer pose real problems for the entry and exit since there are trains modern, reversible with pieces and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 next to the new line inter-city to Ulm.
The regional political and communal prevailed.
The railways is to the party because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of risk of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
From the point of view urban this project is relatively well justified.
The urban space which – according to the graphs planners computer-generated – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and enlargement of the section are designed for trafficking which provided - and this is typical of the 1980s — an enormous growth.
A time there was not yet competition cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the cargo for transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not to freight trains.
The S21, and much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft Schwaben.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade the money involved for other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport refers to all six major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine valley of 180 km.
Since 1987 the line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 made a low-noise braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic is in the heart of Europe.
The Government will consider the judgement on the airport
In Parliament regional Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of air flights at night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had appointed experts to review from the legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Court and is a document more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of Frankfurt airport would be.
The authorization to attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 and 5.00, as envisaged in the government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nuisance air at night.
The coalition must be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgement.
The opposition criticism that period and is trying to pressure the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Administrative Court Federal Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to revert to their promise before the elections and to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as an utter failure to a word.
That is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by alluding to slogan éléctoral FDP “ We wish our promises ”.
The Minister Dieter Posch refute the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government attempts to authorize the night flights using “ d'avocasserie and roublardises ”.
It takes time to carry out a legal review.
The coalition does not take decisions on the basis of a “ first impression rapid ”.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
The interpretation of the opposition on the part on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
US banks repay the aid
Large US banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away their links to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros) for aid under the rescue plan Tarp.
The clear television American CNBC reported in a news report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions attempt to get rid of restrictions imposed, who accompanied the acceptance of, for example the restriction of bonuses awarded to leader as well as the regulation of increased costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors that he earned $19 billion of new money.
The rest of the sum comes from the coffers of the bank which have been met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of Bank of America held to thank the American taxpayers: injection of capital has helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had alleged its capacity by purchasing the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to acquire money in the financial markets to free themselves of guardianship of the State.
The United States bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, was clear CNBC citing the banking community.
Spokesperson Citigroup did not wish to comment.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election accelerated
Finally it is spent more quickly.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of redacteur chief Nikolaus Brender by the Administrative Board of clear German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wished to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting Berlin on ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain has not wanted to confirm - officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
, however, it seems that there was also not more damaging to the due of the ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Council.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, need the vote of 9 to 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed their support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to extend Brender in office.
It is Roland Koch, the words Hesse which had organized a league against the editor.
It had denied that the contract of the esteemed redacteur chief is extended by invoking the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had declined in Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, denouncing the increased political power exerted on the ZDF.
At the end even 35 experts in public law that had intruded in the debate and who believed that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But that is lost.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the sciences-politiques, pedagogy etles Romance languages (Spanish) .
He then worked at Südwestfunk (body radio Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German newspaper nationwide) .
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first to the magazine for news heute-journal ” today) .
May his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 it was the Deputy rédacteur-en-chef; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/92, then until 1998 it was head and presenter of the “ Morgenmagazins ” (news fortnightly presented the morning) ; up to 2001 he was responsible foreign policy ZDF and then head of drafting Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would lodge a complaint constitutional
The enemy of Koch in the Council of Administration, the words of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Treaty Intergovernmental of ZDF so that the proposals of staff due to be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of political figures members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had cleverly manoeuvred to the Council of Administration in criticizing the committee vehemently in its decision to remove Brender.
With this independence journalism, Schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, as the Council could elect without the soupconne to place as a partisan politics.
In the arithmetic of parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Grand cleaning in the university
Successes partial for students: after a year of strike educational Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory, at a meeting between ministers and delegates of the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They particularly set of accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single examination is to close the module study chosen.
Moreover, the burden of work will have to be reconsidée to ensure “ proportions realistic and acceptable ”.
The political authorities and institutions of higher education wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder also committed themselves to organize requirements structural common more flexible for the Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there must be no regulation different from a Land to the other.
Less than reviews
Since the early protests student last June, the Minister of Education Ministers and other universities have constantly expression fashionable: “ étudiabilité ”.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning.
The Accreditation Council decided to reduce significantly the number of reviews: “ Each module must normally be concluded by a single examination ”, in a document about 30 pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Council said that reducing significantly the burden reviews should be able to stop the blunders, that damage to the étudiabilité.
The “ étudiabilité ” should be, in future, the decisive criterion of the organization.
Modules just as the substance should be considered carefully to see if we cannot avoid this feeling of choking in the sometimes in courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deception.
Students should “ have the opportunity and the flexibility necessary to enable and encourage personal initiative ”.
The new regulations will affect access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles should be “ réaccrédités ” every five years, which means that it is only in 2015 that all cycles have been considered.
Ten agencies accreditation organizations on the entire country that depend on Accreditation Board established by the Länder.
In October, Education Ministers had put some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too and testing procedures not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as offices of examinations and the service of international relations
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to make to Parliament an amendment to the law on institutions of higher education.
Following this there will be no more make one consideration to close its studies.
The organization studies should be more flexible, more must be guaranteed the recognition of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, étudiabilité ” of all university cycles will be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The Federal President of the union of students Socialists has indicated that he would like the organization of education policy is more in the future " behind the closed doors ” of Ministers and other universities.
In later after the strike, students as people should be able to speak a little.
Future diplomés of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Presidents (1991) Margret Wintermantel: what students is very useful, " it said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education Ministers with which the 1991 is working on a project of reform common.
For the union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions in Bonn do not go far enough. It seeks the right and opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enrol in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller steering committee member from the GEW also requested that the Länder ensure students Bachelor today, that tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
The Education Ministers have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words “ Arrival in Germany and is beautiful, almost more control. .. ” that begins poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in scraps of phrases, experiences a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but has lost at the same time its territory language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first Professor d’allemand and d’anglais in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for Youth prior to come to Frankfurt.
Söllner received different literary prizes; in 1993, it was the highly coveted poetry of the University of Goethe in Frankfurt and since 2002 it is director of the forum of literature of Hesse in the home of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Did much of him in circles not literary last Tuesday, during a congress in Munich, “ The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror distorting of your cases Securitate ”.
Clearly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as qu’informateur for the political police Securitate.
Söllner has received in 1989 the price of language German jointly with some of the participants.
The tests d’enrôlement started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner ' someone who has not sufficiently shown auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. ”
The poet Werner Söllner is the provider Walter (Walter) .
Almost simultaneously with l’honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her experiences literary copies with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the scene literary is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, for a case which clearly shows the abyss and the low level of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In its own record Securitate, IM Walter has played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Merkel after the faith of Söllner and refers to the positive impact of IM Walter, who had intervened in its favour.
“ It was able to draw all the difficult situations at the time ”, according to Markel.
Merkel has felt the need moralde to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and to the public was unexpected, however admission of a former dissident collaboration with the secret services Romanian is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a reservation for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit ”, after reading the 914 pages of its own record.
Presumably the victims have made speculation and sometimes guessed what names real hid last names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
On the contrary of Germany where between time consultation of the Stasi is a credible process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A clarification systematic was constantly frustrated and slowed in the past.
Only by 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was established to work the assimilation of archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the transfer of files had been rather prolonged since.
In 2005 a law that defines the records.
What influence former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar which, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, said in a trés dismissive to the winner.
It had a psychosis, and ultimately it had questioned only once.
L’infamie power expected to speak here, without any gene, under the pretext of freedom of expression.
While many questions must inevitably are associated with the case Söllner as is so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Who has been deprived? The reaction weighted audiences on admission of Söllner, gives us hope that this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of l’oeuvre of Herta Müller, who was yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Tumultes in the Champions League
Had the impression that a representative was there, spruce from any right of a Christmas party, nice, on which the manufacturer sportswear had spread its goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross monta at midnight quarter in a Mercedes class C, that he had just called, a plastic bag orange of the supplier.
The rights, including the skull chauve attracted attention, allowed himself to lead in the city was still.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel – it had not been drinking alcohol and it was not drunk with happiness.
He spent an evening pleasant but tomorrow it is necessary to return to work.
For it is now that it would start.
Words Switzerland we had just opened three days earlier were clear: “ We have achieved the eighth of final ”, that is to say in the league champions through our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni in Romania " but we must not get carried away by the success. This will be a fight brutal to not to fall ”.
The “ big ” us Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the league champions.
And it will overcome the shortcomings which have resurfaced after the three goals summary of Marica (5) , Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11. )
Choice by fate
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/return match 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December to Nyon.
The joy takes office fulminante the successor to Babbel was moderate.
And joy was not moderate only among those who brought luck, who forwarded to professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, motivated and the pleasure of play.
I see the players and I told them they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the “ plumber of souls ” – Gross, the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais, which no longer effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, did doctors Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel -- ” in the foot when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ".
And Sami Khedira which, after weeks of break for injury, it argued as the best player through its dynamism, tried to describe the “ phenomenon ” in a proverbial “ wind ” and the working method of the new head: “ It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation ”.
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager carefully overvalue the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanian.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad wake to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signala they had achieved the goals of the season but they had others who were still far away.
We have not passed that difficult.
What Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary has not had the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is of the events of the weekend that a television interview the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the beginning of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, not helpful Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He accused the management of weakness of style and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann had tried also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele because its day of free after the game was deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were “ a pure egotism " ground Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They might become a friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group trainer replaced, the sports and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “ largely in the success ” rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann together – and even rights in plastic bag acquiesça.

Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mainly tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures the n’atteignirent very rarely the champion.

It seems that its development company plans to play in that match the stage Wembley in London.
The case Kunduz
Attack frontal opposition: the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case Kunduz.
The parties SPD and The Left (die Left) called on the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After consideration of the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally, " an untruth ” on the strike killing of two fuel tankers in September, said the head of the Parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information to clear ARD ” Tagesschau ” (the newspaper of 20h) .
This means that it lied.
The next to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance in Afghanistan (ISAF) .
That is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the trucks stolen, but well to eliminate two Taliban leadership important.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the attack American air launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, Commander military of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , to take action as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg knew really on the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast believe that Mrs Merkel must make it clear if the strategy of massacre targeted is part of Afghan politics of the Government fédéralet if the chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The chancery in no facon influenced the army action in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were stronger in doutesquant the real reasons the referral of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg on the attack in tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hiding in Minister certain details discomfort.
In the parties of two senior officials suggest, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The “ Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung ” reports that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, it has not answered
Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Parliament which would be on Wednesday following in order dapporter light on the matter.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else is neither wants.
There is not that men are mental, or under the effect of the drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality blur together.
Until they manifest themselves during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our bedrooms clouded, we can play unfettered access to the dreams and fantasies wildest.
However, awake, experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has the reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not that among patients mental or under the influence of drugs.
This is our imagination that is in question: is the same neuronale which allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to disappear.
A state of stimulation aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, at best it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castañeda, states seconds of chamanes, psychosis and hallucinations are due to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmettrices brain - first and foremost the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and l’achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The hallucinations complex and delusional thoughts occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power on the person.
Since l’antiquité, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 “ great resemblance between the madness and the dream ”, to Sigmund Freud the dream was even “ a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory its members ”.
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into in a comic book.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours glaring.
L’attraction land has power over on him, there is a tsunami of the ceiling.
It is a blow.
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, mouths bloodied, showing the teeth.
They continue, give it the legs with heavy boots bold, the cast against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body.
Some thundering, evil, rant, outgoing walls and radio.
In the bear those voices that l’insultent and l’humilient.
Henning T. pulled up two cables of its chain stéréo, in fact a loop and l’attache to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It is on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
It is obvious.
The circle stands out.
Whether you will be a lesson, shout the voice in a chorus to extract the Rupture. “ Go in a clinic and to treat! ”
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six psychosis acute, the last date of 2, the first of 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, also has maniaco-dépressif, it takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I had fears terrible and despondency.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
One percent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the internal and the outside world, they are in a state d’hyper excitement, which are they may suffer d’hallucinations, megalomania, of madness relational or persecution.
It is very easy to hear voices – of votes that controls, which elicited comments or dialogue.
The hallucinations optical are not uncommon.
The person cannot distinguish between the important and l’insignifiant, the brain can no longer filter the signals disruptive, the aware is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, the hype opens the gates to a tide of ideas and fantasies following childbirth more root of conscience.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the National University Hospital in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum) .
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is reflected in passive roles, it is as in a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, ” the structure sensory and space of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ”.
The thoughts and hallucinations delusional are based on reality, the alienation of the experienced a real framework.
Why our brains does this kind of speaking., is still a mystery to scientists.
Exceptional situations can lead people to lose temporarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that the persons concerned are petty brain damage.
Assumed that the maturation neuronale brain is disrupted at an early stage of development for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, said Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained, is the way in which the anomaly of the system neuronal occurs and the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there are susceptibility.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains boiler.
This crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to undo while others buy drugs dearly for it.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years on hallucinations and the phenomena of images illusory: last year he published his results in a book entitled “ The unreal world in our head. "
The hallucinations form part of the phenomena typical psychoses but also of a huge number of many other diseases.
The they psychological problems such as the borderline or depression but also the headache, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s or the head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of fragments of memories that normally has been withdrawn.
They take form when areas of the brain dealing with perceptions sensory, are hyperactives or enough refrénées; when our brains boiler but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state just as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other statements mentally.
In recent studies, a third of participants recognized have made at least once in his life a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it is going to high school.
A young girl to have normal.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, thin, long hair châtain, the floor.
When she replied his comrades watch it surprised – no one else sees nor will the boy.
They believe that this young girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is being stirred, hear and see the boy as it sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a sensation pleasant, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I mad? , wondered t it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real, and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, it can complete the course because the professor is just presenting a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly attempting to explain the equations to the table.
The night appearances are frightening.
When, in the dark of his room, it expected the sleep comes too rarely and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is being stirred or dream already, if the images it sees, the faces grimaçants or the girl with cuts sanguinolentes on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, Cree t such creatures.
It omits this or the parents or friends, they took to a mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has now 20 years.
It has had its ferry last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago hallucinations ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten it knows very well that it is not mad.
The folly is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the likelihood is that it has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not enough occupied, the theatre.
Sarah K., only child, was afraid of other children when it was small and often played alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13, that rights which she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not his real father.
The same areas brain active for the visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for the impressions and noise, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality. ” every experience ”, according to Kasten ” takes place in the brain, the reality is made from here.
The hallucinations are also images in the brain, which is why they seem so real. ”
For Kasten, dreams at night are also a form d’hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those psychosis acute.
Unlike schizophrenic, the mentally healthy is to recognize that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises its patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and l’hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has, unfortunately, quickly tendency to take experiences imaginary pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and medical director of the clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy of hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience so-called oniroïde, a particular form of the amendment of the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex that are seen as genuine by those who live and can differentiate the dream when it is in a state of stimulation.
The state of conscience oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of pathologies extreme as to patients polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total incapacity and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life by its own imagined world which is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental between the dream and l’hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world has held but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, a capacity of organisation that is given to men, not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, historian of art also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book “ Change of heart ” as safeguard action of the soul.
It has 49 years, when its aware for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body was sentenced to stand still in intensive care.
Claussen plunges in a world that has created, visit foreign travel in time. It is an old man bed in a sanatorium railway, a robot to assist us ensuring on his health.
It is living through age among the noble that manufacture drugs from blood.
It is removed by a Greek riding motorcycles that l’emmène in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the névé of the Alps and a mafia.
It s’absorbe completely in this imagined world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic voyages are essentially any dream.
The dream is a state quite different, he wrote in describing what he lived.
On the contrary dreams, the memories from travel mentally are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
Can say that they are much more distinct and more intensive that life experiences.
Much of this lived ignited the horizon of our other experiences daily, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the delusions oniroïdes, psychosis, hallucinations and experiences psychédéliques show us how our representations of external reality are fragile even in.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarized the psychologist Kasten ” can lead to a distortion of what we call the reality. ”
Experience which can be quite enlightening.
The first snow falling into
Burda
A 27 years, children will take the result of the house of editions.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO editions Burda is an intermediate solution: more long-term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children return to press group, he said to the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company should remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit in 27 years and are committed to mainstream society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been resolved in advance.
Whether they will be active in the business will thereafter.
It remains to be seen also if they are capable.
You cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing if they have the capacity.
This will demolish children as well as the business.
Burda had said last Thursday that it will withdraw the post Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
It was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently it held the sector Treasury is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and following the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was the head of marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time this is not a family member who is leading the editions Burda.
The children of Burda respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which would have today 42 years, died a few years ago.
The nommination of Kallen is also used to make the connection of 10 or 15 years ”
Burda said that the holding company should remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always been held in families that have left lead by a bulimia, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate into thinking that they could climb higher.
It was never my strategy.
I have never been rêvede power Universal, said Burda.
I see absolutely not in the role of coach of the country as could be, Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues as the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility of even see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It used its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly fee very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, l’abonnement data of l’iPhone.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life for six times more than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited its grand-frère American, but with a surprise.
The price of its monthly fee, about 12 euros, includes roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what the data when you cross a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to check his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options travel, but for me, I would have made a PhD in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
The reminders on repeated the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had a barely discernible.
On the outside of his native country, hesitating to use the data, and it was not wrong.
Journalist small aircraft such as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is Fon when it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various proposals to use their network data.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
Without subscription and without soup.
It is a device connected and it pays in his purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope one day for the FonPeek: an option purchasing with access to life as Peek proposes already in the United States.
I do not want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so simply because I believe that is more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the system.
The colour preferred Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, colour preferred by the first lady of the United States.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a mantle of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany it in the second time, no doubt, the most important of his life: the surrender in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar on both occasions: in addition to the colour ressemblante, a yellow firing towards green with reflections brilliant, twice, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was unsure of great embroidery or a necklace.
If although a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and has chosen to deliver the same held.
But the fabric in which have done both sets them very different.
If for function it was a delicate manoeuvring thick, however, it dealt in Oslo a velvet printed.
The materials also are different: shoes green to heel average for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but Golden, this time.
The hairdressing also has changed: the hair are now records then that it was dropped last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems professionals because of their maternity
The discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
That reveals the study " Fertility and career women in Spain ”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with l’Instituto of Women.
The investigation, carried out on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not and the type of job.
Those who have not activity outside the home, working part-time or have a work stable put earlier, had their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, have rejected the entry in the relationship and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years old with a fixed have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having installed as a couple. This increases to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. ” These data show that women with a stable job required more time in their lives for it, which has led to the postponement union and the arrival of children.
Moreover, the type of job exercised influence widely maternity, but at least the start date ”, explains the Fellowship of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The is another factor that is widening the gap of the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group that between 35 and 49 years, those who have a basic and higher have been mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
“ Another disctinction is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with average or above reverse this programme and to give priority to achieve a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child ”, said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is much
L 'Oreal Paris is adding a new name to its list jalousée d’ambassadrices: Diane Kruger.
From next year, l’actrice German embody the image of several products of the mark, entonnant the motto Universal ' Because I going well ”.
The protagonist of Happy Christmas, one of the actresses most elegant on the international stage, is joining other celebrities included among L’Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andy MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire) .
Among men, the mark of cosmetics account of the ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons d’anatomie) and Matthew Fox (the companion d’Evangeline in Lost) .
The price of fashion British
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its largest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, met for the surrender annual price, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one has missed the appointment.
L’ex dummy Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best dummy of the year.
The poker of as Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 “ x-rays ” writers who have crossed his life literary (and sometimes, his other life) .
It does not according to the sexes predictable and apprehended (short biographical, lives and works) , but by trying something similar to the core d’ignition man he created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent is neither the scares nor the illuminations.
Délicieux pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and relectures.
I leave you a few snapshots.
At Albert Camus: " In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a compulsion spiritual, almost physical, that I experience without the appoint: the pleasure against the sad fate, the moral without guilt and innocence no god. ”
On Samuel Beckett: “ Nihiliste, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with humour poetic éblouissant, meaningless, as the blade of the knife that threatened to kill him. ”
On Graham Greene: “ Our rights was inspired by this woman a passion which lasted 13 years ago, in the flesh of which he conjugua emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a privilege spiritual which was to reach the sky by the road to perdition. ”
At James Joyce: “ L’Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand metres of literature, it must climb by the north, on which the best mountaineers lâchent again and again. ”
On William Faulkner: “ It was a strange type.
In itself, he said sometimes he was son of a landowner County and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “ This writer received the cry denies pushed from a bridge by this man of Munch to be reflected the substance of the night of the twentieth century, in its form literary, and it did in the brain itself and invoking the postériorité with a speech violate the asticots. ”
On Dorothy Parker: ' One day it began to its knees and prayed: “ God beloved, I beg them to do that I continue to write as a woman. "

On Virginia Wolf: “ In its baggage she was carrying its depression.
Her husband agreed very normally it tell him qu’Édouard VII l’épiait between the azalées or that the birds were singing in Greek.
It has never seen a man as patient and in love with a névrosée whose talent literary exceeded the madness. ”
On Confederation of Older: “ What did Martín-Santos if this is to try to conceal Joyce among Older?
Qu’essaya Benet if it is to supporters of Older by Faulkner?
What did This if not aspire the glory of this man for it serve as a pedestal? ”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, which has about 70 years, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved to the APS and are weighing more than six kilos, and without saying word, they assenèrent two legs that grew the dog seriously wounded.
Our indignation is great because we cannot see what is d’amusant to attack a free small animal defenceless, who also was in leaves.
Added to this indignation of a woman strolling calmly and which, when it injuria these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, ultimately, any person lower than him.
L’épisode took place about 5 p.m. on a Tuesday as another in a neighbourhood usually quiet.
The dog has gémi all day.
We have of course filed a complaint to the police station the neighbourhood even if we doubt that works much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to condemn this.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to mistreat a free animal defence which gives us affection, friendship and us company.
We do not know where is the proper education and the respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the use of helmets
The manufacturer of tyres Michelin, in collaboration with the Foundation Spanish for Road Safety (Fesvial) , has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly motorcycles, as has been said today the two structures.
The initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmets, as this is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in an accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that the campaign had in line with its commitment to road safety, which “ goes beyond the design and manufacture of products increasingly safe " and that it contributed to this objective by other actions educational and informative.
The new campaign of encouragement of the use of helmets in two wheels, “ To be or not to be ”, will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the wider dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety ” is a constant concern ” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products to be safe.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures of the employers ' association of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
It should, however, to qualify the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with 60 per cent reduction on the previous year.
Consequently, despite the region last month, registrations accumulated in those 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles which falls under the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickups, pick-up trucks, vans and light trucks chassis light) 95 853 were sold.
The big clouds affecting the calls have not provided dispelled. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100 per cent of cases through an external funding.
Thus, restrictions under the control of bank loans, other factors such as a rise in unemployment or the persistence of the terrible economic situation.
In this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who wish to acquire a vehicle commercial light under 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of Co2 only 160 grams per kilometre, can also apply, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, among Ganvam, it reminded once again the need for the administration to attach attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The Association of dealers provides a year 2010 similar to the outgoing one, for which it calculates a drop in sales of passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19 per cent.
Aid to the emergency brakes is now compulsory
As with anti-lock brakes ABS and as will take place with the stability control ESP, systems for aid to the emergency brakes will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by the way action, it can also help prevent many shocks rear.
L’assistant the emergency brakes is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it is not always the pressure until the end.
According to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident did not support on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Intervention aid, in revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance whose car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which behaviour could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent systems emergency brakes: calculated that a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device has effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpone until January the plan for Opel
While the workers from Opel's Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer has warned it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan, Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, each item of the plan was approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be first submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010.
However, GM will ensure a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising, that the Swedish Government has intensified the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as quickly as possible.
GM confessed to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of manufacturer Dutch of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Group of the Russian Converg, is increasing in importance.
In cases where there would agree with none of them, GM may sell part of Saab in the company Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
When driving to the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and precious jewel, engineers of Porsche left the Boxster S and managed to l’amincir of nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilos.
This has led to happen, first, the roof which was replaced by a roof sheeted manual, capable of 21 kilograms, to use in aluminium as those of the GT3, 15 kilos of less, to clear the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank of petrol from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, of bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with tyres light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have given up the audio system CDR-30, winning six other kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by door handles in tissues, saving per kilo.
Although the model are also with the box PDK dual clutch, the test was done on a model to manual transmission of six speeds, mainly on network secondary of California, mountain regions, with sharp particularly tortuous.
His behaviour cannot be described as d’irréprochable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car to drive on the floor with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees as secure in bends, including at high speed.
That is a small athlete, capable d’échauffer its musclesà speed for the time needed, until we ask them to sprint, slow, recover and grow again its moteur…
It is out what we wanted. Through its direction, communicative that precise, the car will this qu’indiqueront our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with a precision.
His of engine will
The son of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option “ sport ” or through a system that changes the rugissement engine used already on the Panamera.
The capacity up is brutal, the ruling or hopping.
The suspensions are firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The pavement that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was rather spoiled, but the car was well managed the chicken.
The assistants electronic did just act of presence throughout the journey, while on some disagreement we have found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and is more than a simple amendment to the Boxster S.
The car will be for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.

Other challenges

Brazil sets a date for the start of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president should abandon the legation diplomatic no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, for business to the embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that " Mel " knows that they must leave the embassy, where it is refugee since 21 September, before that date.
“ It is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination ”.

Thank you very much
After days roses since the spring, during which asset inflation was the note dominant on the markets, uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents take decisions on a future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize the debt by buying direct asset and indirectly providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions are buying assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have almost been finalized and, without calling into question their political 36-year-old maverick liquidity, are beginning to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery measures heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and business obligations are rising again, although they remain far removed from levels paranormaux they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected.
There is new a flight towards the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been shelters selected by investors, followed by an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard& Poor'sa threatened with a new downward revision of the characterization of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying again to cause a case for lesresponsables global economic policy that had stalled the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is announcing a new day d’Action pardons.
However, the situation of Dubai is like a fight tribal between the sheikhs to restore its power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that finds the tub in roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly rational that ECOFIN saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro zone of not respecting its commitments.
What is logical, is that the Ecofin Council has prompted the Greek Government to transparency and its citizens share the need to extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, until our differences of public debt increase to the extent of the obligations from European companies, nousn’avons not to worry.
If the differences European shriveled and as ours continued to increase, it would be one risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
Affair Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators standby require most services studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the burden with a Japanese model pourl’économie Spanish, it does not much hope for.
Again, this has all the air of an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for now “ prudence security ”.

The President d’Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his statement, which was followed by that of the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had spoken to the subcommittee, huit-clos.
For the president d’Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million more and 2030, in the case where nuclear power stations now in operation would remain open.
If that is not the case, investment necessary would come not to 60 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but the distribution networks and to interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and will need to increase power.
His gamble focuses on gas-fired power stations that coal, with recovery systems of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other “ energies of support ”.
Galán, which believes that in a sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with that calls for the business, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “ a clear long-term ” in this direction, despite the measures “ ad hoc ” has qualified the President d’Iberdrola.
However, Galán believes that the investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching maturity and a framework gainful stable is necessary to address them.

On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in relation to the money after the Champions League, although it has been more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two) .
Distribution
This apparent paradox is due to the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1.09 million through the Champions League.
This UEFA will 413.1 million payments fixed: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the games classification (including l’Atlético Madrid) has received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match disputed.
There is also a bonus winner (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team) . Those who arrive in eighth of final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter final reçoivent3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, in the face of 5.2 received by the other members.
For example, payments fixed, a club win at least 7.1 million and a maximum 31.2 million.
Furthermore, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super European Cup in August.
But in addition, there is the payments variables, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed on proportional of each market television.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four places attitrées.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40 per cent of the money allocated, 30 per cent for the second, 20% for the third and 10 per cent in the fourth.
The other part will be paid by the number of matches played during edition of the current year.
New Rumasa provides EUR 61 million to 29.9 per cent of Sos.
The group Nueva Rumasa outlined yesterday the details of the action by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.

In an attempt to remain outside any offers purchasing and been judicial of its former managers, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal auditing.
A decision that in fact the first woman to hold a post leader in the company.
It is a newly created position which will depend directly on the President of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remained submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million Sos to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that over the next few months Sos reveals new misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out.
On the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and d’Unicaja) said yesterday in l’Audience National they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, garages cars are not the only winners.
Every day thousands of cars which have suffered a sinister are reduced to a garage, where an expert to evaluate the damage and the cost of compensation.
Every disaster is different, and the cost of parts and time of labour can be a long and complex process.
Calculate to hand the cost of a compensation between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
In contrast, with assistance electronically stored tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
The providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American Solera, is the company leader; 80 per cent estimates are made with its products.
The other companies in competition in the field of tools for assessment and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.

Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that, during the last five years more than versions, alternatives and motors have been launched that over the previous five decades.
When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very difficult, because it is cataloguing each thousand pieces of the vehicle and include its price.
In addition, there is a graphic design “ intelligent ” of each model on which we can click on the various parts of a car of tourism.
If it is a model sold en masse, the work can be ready in a week if the process moving very quickly.
If there is a car little sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.

Audatex invests each year 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The creation of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer products.
The most common to the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are tools for the management of spare scrapped or to calculate the sale value or residual of a car.
The only company which has a guide which provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex suggests not in our country, but it does in the United States.

The company offers ten different tools, the flagship being AudaPlus, the solution standard evaluation of claims for experts.
It contained cars, motorcycles, industrial vehicles and heavy vehicles.
Apart from the cost of coins, it takes into account the time of reparation estimated by the manufacturer or the scale of paint.
The tool is buying itself by its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, to the maximum 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands d’expertises, is negotiating the price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow identification total of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows d’enchérir on vehicles declared wrecks.
His office of statistics is very useful in identifying trends, analysis géo-démographiques or know the current problems by marks or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a brand determined went to the garage for a breakdown or how many had suffered claims serious for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company which is dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to parts, price and time Records of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture.

Internet auctions of cars rugged
In October last, the group Solera bought Autoonline, an Internet-based platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles affected.
The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could grow next year to 15 per cent.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value added services to its customers, with access to a huge international market.
The service in its assessment and sales is exclusively for professionals in the sector, as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, the scrapyard and sellers professionals must be registered before conducting operations.

Devis of garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex guarantees that l’usager received cost in only four stages: to identify the vehicle, seek the spare part, create a estimates and the generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince professionals older which, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-roaders etc. 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Naturally, they use it, a computer and an Internet link are necessary.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic design real model in question is can it selects the piece needed.
L’utilisateur can include variables such as the price of the workforce, or cuts, then it can print the estimates for the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool in its assessment as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the budget for the garage, does not include the time of labour estimated.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which may be the subject of credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, select a door and turn to see the inside.
