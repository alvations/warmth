What we will do? čssd in Prague knows voldemorta nor cukrárnu
The new capital councillors from čssd will have to seem to overcome some linguistic barrier to Prague in the Council and in its re-elected zastupitelstvu understand colleagues from the ODS.
Newspaper aktuálně.cz members of the new Council of čssd 'us', as they know notorious established slang which, on the City Council first emerged during the last few years, when the Prague essentially the current coalition partners.
Kódovaný phraseology that Prague political cream introduced during the previous eras primátora Paul béma, describes some of the best known figures, the situation and trials in the city.
Surprisingly, it has become clear that the new councillors known notions of too.
At least this claim.
'who is voldemort?'
'I really do not know.'
'I am rather nervousness in the Prague policy', to respond to the test 'kmotrovského' slovníčku councillors on culture lukáš kaucký.
And while it is a political a veteran, Karl Březina would respond similarly, councillors.
To be on the concept of 'golf jamka'.
'This is the only expression of those me you have put forward, which sometimes use'.
'otherwise slang generally, I do not recognise the'.
From slovníčku, whose words aktuálně.cz newspaper published in June this year prior to the election Congress ODS, took office six examples, mainly those which are notorious associated with the Prague magistrátem.
The Socialists should explain the concepts of 'voldemort', 'the greatest golf jamka in Prague', 'go into cukrárny', 'bull šíje', 'betrayal of the capital' and 'oplechovat'.
Three of councillors with kvízem agreed the fourth - antonín weinert, which is in the future šéfovat pražskému education - first of all, an interview promised later but has not taken the telephone.
The fifth councillors Peter dolínek straight test refused.
'these things at all neřeším and this as entertaining's Civic Democrats, I am not going to evaluate the'.
'I now řeším, as we understand it in the framework of our programmes'.
As has already been said, councillors lukáš kaucký in heading the supposedly nerozeznal that we are talking about vlivném entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora béma Romano janouškovi.
'voldemort' kauckému him says nothing, and only the deadline, which in the test guessed correctly, is' the greatest golf jamka in Prague '.
'This is the tunnel blanka kaucký says,', and adds: 'But that is known, rather, of the newspaper'.
'I will have to pay some language rate' vtipkuje.
Golfovou jamku then as tunnel blanka dešifruje management not only matador Karl Březina would councillors, but also for the environment lukáš a timid.
Both the Social Democrats then know who is really voldemort and lukáši plachému povědomé is also where this figure to find - foresees the importance of the expression 'go into cukrárny'.
'I think this means to go into some of the Prague enterprise,' it is a timid close to deal with that, it is a seat janouškových firms.
Equally with březinou recalls that knowledge načerpal rather from the newspapers, than to such a dictionary used.
In the social democracy according to those at test no similar zaběhnutý slovníček slangových terms does not exist.
'I advised, with my colleagues, but it appears that really nothing of the sort we have'.
'we say rather names, sometimes use shortcuts and distortions names,' says the President of the Prague čssd Peter hulínský, which partisans přezdívají hulda.
'at school bříza told me, but I do not know if I say so and colleagues,' grants to own přezdívce Karl Březina would.
Newspaper aktuálně.cz name tried and works.
It is for the party people weinert councillors děda or less friendly man who aroused pity, zastupitel Miroslav few, which in themselves before the elections draw fraud in the sponzoringu party, has for some colleagues dubbed the 'igráček'.
Přezdívky are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in the internal mluvě concede.
Hulínský supposedly huldu has turned a deaf ear to, but the newspaper aktuálně.cz noted and another dubbed this Prague President.
'doctor obuškového rights "supposedly recalls that Peter hulínský gained its title judr. on the Bratislava Police Academy.

But man over the only mává hands.
'One says this, the second the,' mračí.
Ostravsko is becoming a major laboratories deregulation.
After the new year is waiting for the vast majority of housing, which have in the Czech Republic has non-market their rent for.
Aktuálně.cz has therefore decided to visit 'laboratory' personally.
Havířovská čekárna rpg is one of a total of four to ostravsku and on Tuesday in nine morning is already full.
Next door to door is guards from the security agencies and with her vyvolávací device.
'their rent for 2011', it is a special button on his dotykovém screen.
One ťuknutí and from machines by a papírek with number.
Nestihnete nor read '157' and your number already pípá on large screen čekárny below the ceiling.
For half a vteřiny you at least.
On their rent for after a bit comes to ask the elderly couple will, bursts in the waiting room, but new rents obviously not at all.
Most people came to solve common problems, such as ever - applications for corrections premiums events and the like.

Rpg flats them in letters rent proposes an increase of 15 to 38%.
Special přepážka to new nájmům klientském centre was opened on 18 November.
'It is over a week, so it is only in its' running in 'period,' women are responsible for the Bank after hesitation, the moment when the client present as a journalist.
Deregulation and bakalovy former mining flats are local incendiary subject.
Before the elections, it loudly enough to take a Vice-President of Parliament and ostravský native lubomír zaorálek from čssd, and now it is local newspapers full.
'Twenty years after them chcu new floor.'
'or POs. Ana CD for me to záchodě nevyměnili' ulevuje in úvodou this man.
So far, according to most of the workers are pensioners, to see whether they receive relief from the rent if sign time how rpg them in the special supply promises.
Half of relief on their rent for President, get others also tenants who new sign the Treaty by 15 December.
Havířovská 'deregulatory' přepážka but questions zahlcena certainly is not.
'from yesterday's 360 clients here because of the rent for 2011 was only around forty or fifty people' worker estimate for the Bank.
Rpg on the web and their nástěnkách proposes individual negotiating treaties, where it will be needed.
If, however, rent on both sides agree, it will have to determine an independent court.
'It is not about the threats, but on the information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure' highlights rpg on their website.
'There is no judge will not be one of the workers' think rpg flats, and the man on the street before klientským centre it gives partly for the truth.
'I am 13 000 pension rights and let me five thousand on food, I do not have to be soudil' claims.
After all, women but immediately create huge uncertainties.
'We will see.'
'Mr zaorálek them in the media vzkazuje, whether nepodepisují, so people perhaps take a wait-and-see approach,' thinking.
The regulation of the rents ends up in most of the Czech Republic with the new year 2011 and according to the rpg flats is their increased economic necessity.
'the existing rent is still falls short of neither the necessary for a simple maintenance of the housing stock,' recalls Paul klimeš, the director of the rezidenčního portfolio society rpg apartments that naštvaným tenant has increased vytýkaná neglect the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in homeowners rents.
While for five years between the years 2005 and 2010 could rpg from rents to invest in housing censuses four billion, for four years since the year 2011 until 2014, it is to be 5.2 billion.

'and it always will be most about 7,50 just over $10 per cubic square and month' will appear on the screen.
Only in the 400 homes from their rent for the portfolio rpg rises by 38%.
'in these cases, is on the increase of the extremely low sums 19,66 just over $10 per cubic square,' highlights rpg.
For 2600 flats their rent for next year will remain the same.
Rpg flats promises that deregulation nevyžene nájmy skokově, but it will be distributed to the four to eight years.

To include agents školka, understand the architects
The administrative building avriopoint in brně is new based society arch.design.
No one would have expected that conceals also miniškolku everything that includes - with barevnými walls, a creative furniture kupou toys and even miniaturním playground to outlaw terase.
Since October last year it may visit children employees arch.designu.
Projekčně-architektonická society arch.design, of whose ateliérů delivered a number of significant brněnských buildings, anticipated with space for their corporate miniškolku since the first designs avriopoint buildings.
It employs almost 90 people, mainly in the age of babyboomu and had her on the fact that women projektantky and architect can quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of zkrácených jobs is školka benefitem which arch.design offers its employees in the framework of the social agenda.
Stavařky architect and so have the opportunity to reconcile the difficult job with a child care.
We have invented miniškolku arch.designu employees themselves and with the support of the leadership they have managed to obtain a subsidy of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate miniškolka is financed from the European social fund through the operational programme for human resources and employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grantovému funding (subsidy of EUR 2, 8 miles. Just over $10) could buy equipment and equipment and for a period of two years to ensure the qualified staff and traffic.
After the financial subsidies (2 years) is society arch.design obligation for a period of 3 years to run miniškolku at their own cost.
Preparation of the project has lasted for one year and with requests for subsidy significantly helped society economy rating.
Care ensures qualified personnel, for children be looked after all day long by fosters a nurse mš and a teacher in kindergartens can therefore go children without age limits, yet it is most older 3 years.
Because it is a 'miniškolku', there may be, at the same time, only 5 children, during the day, but will replace them even more.
Traffic kindergartens is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right školku use regardless of the hierarchy of status in the company.
Although it is about individual education and care, programmatic content in miniškolce is comparable with the framework programme pre-school education.
Children are here not only play, but they are guaranteed and high-quality teaching - from the fundamental cognition after training into school benches, is taught and the English language.
Class is equipped with not only the toys inspiring games, but also a computer, which children can enjoy.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates friendly and positive environment.
Parents can ever to check their child and fall stress situation zpožděným vyzvedáváním children from kindergartens remote from the workplace parents.
Parents and use the working time more productively.
It is not surprising that there is naturally creates a relationship of loyal servant - the employer.
Arch.design is placed on the Czech companies that offer significant benefit in the recruitment of new staff, are friendly to the family and through this programme to strengthen the staffing marketing.
The House from bones fascinated by even after 100 years. Look into the spraying of from gaudího
The roof looks like other pravěkého ještěra, schodiště resembles the backbone of dinosaur and balkony are open to fish.
Such is the House Casa batlló in Barcelona from the Catalonian architect Antoni gaudího.
From the local, the House thanks to its organic tvarům dubbed the House from bones.
Organic tvary, wild colours, unusual using stone, debris kachlů and some šupiny commemorating the mosaic, and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical of the secesi Antoni gaudího.
Průčelí House making snové line něžné colours and textury commemorating the nature and animals.
In the detailed observations geometričnost, is to see the rhythm and precisely measured procedure.
On the night of the whole House some sounds even more dramatic is nasvícená, so that was the impression lustre colours even reinforced by.
Vinutí and kroucení tvarů is equally in the interiérech.
Timber in waves follows the okenní Ram, zábradlí, ozdobné elements of the door, kukátka and lišty.
The House batlló, which stands in a district eixample on an animated shopping streets passeig de grácia Nos 43, přestavbou House of 1877 from an architect Emilio sala Cortes.
Reconstruction, there have been two years and the House was completed in a year of 1906.
Investor, rich industrialist, Josep batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of old buildings and creating a completely new, but soon adopted gaudího idea on the unusual and cheaper reordering.
Činžovní House Casa batlló but Antoni Gaudí was not proposing himself.
Working with him architect, Josep Maria jujol.
It is precisely on his projektantském prkně arose decorations for representational apartment property owners and the use of a mosaic to this facade.
To this facade of work and a number of other creators and artists.
The joint work on the proposals of the House Casa batlló was triggered by the successful cooperation jujola with gaudím.
Jujol participated in the construction of gaudího House Casa kind and fleet güell in which are another gaudího works.
From the local, the House soon after the completion of the rise of thanks to my organic tvarům dubbed the 'House of bones'.
Others it because of the specific mechanism of the opening up of windows began to call it the 'zívajícím House'.
It also says that at the height of the shipbuilding is vypodobněn sword of St George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include the further sochařské elements of shipbuilding.
Gaudí into the House proposed at that time a unique system of central heating with odvětrávacími průduchy and typical komíny.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový tend to.
When formulating Gaudí absolutely nerespektoval then building regulations and nenechával tie them.
While at the beginning of the construction of received from the city of construction permit it, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing the City Council was the result of zhrozena and asked for redress.
Radním appears, for example, that the construction of intervene pillar into public chodníku.
To rectify this never happened, on the contrary: only 15 days after the challenge of urban areas, Josep batlló applied (and successfully gained) authorisation to rent out two top buildings.
He owner of a man to step into the lower tiers.
In the gallery at the second floor was social Salon and in the third floor ložnice and private parts bytu.
The bottom was pronajato klenotnictví.
The whole House it crosses šestipatrový schodiště, which can climb right up to the very střešní terasu.
The fundamental elements of perestroika was the abolition of all genuine angle and direct lines and their replacement with zakřivenými walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of interconnection between space.
The social part can be opening the door salonních completely to link and greater society together can comfortably to communicate, without at the same time, the privacy of the necessary for nezachovala intimnější talks.
The House with gaudího přestavbou gained in addition to the new fronts also non-traditional roof and two floors.
It is also an impressive gaudího game is light, blue and bíle glazované dlaždice, which is obložen internal auditors and světlíky.
The game of two colours adds the best light in all echelons of the House.
It is enough simply to bet on the principle that the White reflects the light of more than tmavá which, on the contrary, the sun's rays absorbs.
The House Casa batlló, which was included in the fund in 2005 UNESCO World Heritage, everyone can visit.
On the floor of the House is nejprostornější and nejhonosnější be made available to the public.
Owners for this step to only in the year 2002, on the occasion of the celebrations of the century the 50th anniversary of the birth of the famous writer.
For examinations on getting because discovered that it is a very favourable enterprise and, moreover, extended the checks on the common and podkrovní spaces, including střešní terasy.
Vstupné into memory is certainly not negligible amounts to EUR 16,50 and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist průkazek have 20% discount.
Sum greatly exceed the cost of vstupného into other gaudího buildings in the city.
If you want a taste of the true spirit of the House with dračími věžičkami, you have quickly skamarádit with some of the population činžáku and to visit him directly at home.
How to select matraci and rošt: women have different requirements than men
Not honosný Kanshi Ram beds, but the quality of surface area, and therefore lehací matrace rošt, provide the basis for a really good beds.
It must, however, harmoniously complement to suit the particular users.
When selecting decides plenty of things from the weight, height, age, health and gender owners.
It is important also the type of, and in which the matrace rošt are purchasing.
A typical example?
To be on the weekend chalupy where we regularly netopí, are not suitable latexové matrace, because more slowly 'zahřívají'.
Moreover, have significantly more weight than the standard polyuretanová matrace.
At the same time it is necessary is regularly turn.
If, in fact, have a lot of odvzdušňovacích kanálků at its core, and is still lies in the firm board, intercepted vlhkost: could arise under them and the blight.
When selecting decides also custom.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where the often use a lot of high matrace with změkčující layer, it will feel well on low and with hard surface.
'Perhaps all hokejisté who returning from nhl, accusing me that here nevyspí.'
'on their shoulders, otlučená heels and boky matrace needed to změkčující layer lazy foam.'
'This is recommend even for people with diabetes, who have the disorder of the human nervous system so badly přejímají, information' from the joint degeneration, and skin, 'explains Sylva hadamcziková, which on čalouněný furniture specialises.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers therefore matrace years ago with línou pěnou sháněla.
'It is now in the humour, appropriate matrace has to be tempur, Italian magniflex, but also the Czech tropico.'
You do not need to be borec from nhl to appreciate línou pěnu.
This "miracle" simply works.
Optimises its tuhost and shape according to absorbovaného heat or adapt your teplému body.
Nothing you pushing in the night not převracet as after the difficult struggle.
Quite simply, it is better to vyspíte.
Lazy foam works as protection against proleženinami.
In the choice of the size of the matrace to their altitudes přidejte even the length of chodidla, which is about 21 and 34 height.
A man and a woman with height around 180 height so need bed 210 to 220 height.
The minimum šířka for one should be for dvoulůžka 90 height, together, therefore, 180 height.
In separate nets, for example, in the case of singlistů, recommends at least 120 up to 140 height.
For comfort and possible visit.
Otherwise, it is' rule for width for the bed simple: in camps on the back, you should have a hand comfortably slightly pokrčené in lokti 'instructs ing. Helena prokopová, cechmistryně cechu čalouníků and dekoratérů, which is the subject of a healthy their sleep and ergonomie furniture pays for a number of years and it lectures on vocational schools.
For dvoulůžka needs every own rošt and matraci, here, however, careful when they purchase, to reconcile matrací height.
Otherwise, there would be nothing other than rošty screw it in. In various highs, that you will, however, for each rámu beds may not be able.
Pěnové matrace should have the value of at least 14 height, types of with pružinovou kostrou at least 15, at least three centimetry count on tvarovací and kypřicí layer.
'in dotyku hands or landing on every matraci certainly pružiny feel' warns Helena prokopová.
Every matrace requires a certain type of roštu.
Celočalouněná bed nets, when matrace and basis are as srostlá siamská twins have in ložnicích what to do.
Matrace badly větrají cannot be vyprat their potah, which already is normal.
And as for the night routinely vypotíme 0.2 until 0,75 l potu, it is clear that after five to seven years matrace starts to remind one large (and ucpané) sítko.
Experts and therefore refuse to advertising slogans about lifetime mileage matrací up to 25 years, or even permanent safeguards.
However, everything has its but.
And that is why the Council from practice since retailers: matrací with šířkou 120 or 140 height of hygiene and work snímatelný povlak nevzdávejte, but, rather than přidejte matracový chránič that you can easily free up and vyprat.
Even if now normally produce potahy matrací with zdrhovadly around the constituency, so after rozepnutí get two parts (for money and the size of the washing machines a lot of important!), yet could manipulation with larger types of (and in one man) in the battle to remind lightweights in the ring with severe.
You are in bed rather roštu firm for?
Never!
A maximum of bed specified for the visit on one night.
Nevertheless, CD for opatřete (if it is no longer) větracími small holes and use matraci with pružinovou kostrou and height at least 15 height with pružinami in bags (from něm.taschenfederkern) and kypřicí layer.
Polyuretanová matrace on such a basis does not belong.
On nepolohovací lamelové rošty with 14 to 18 lamelami will be appropriate latexové or sendvičové matrace (to be a combination of latexu and kokosu), but it is always worth rošty you with a greater number of lamel, 28 even more, where are the lamely in the area of the shoulders of duplicated and it is possible to regulate their tuhost.
On polohovací lamelové rošty not matrace with pružinovou kostrou because polohování unresponsive.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel can afford, even the so-called ramenní kolébku.
It is a special embed lamel which allows force, or even lamelu there, so that our shoulder spáče much 'zabořilo'.
For men who have bolted 'heels over the whole', certainly an important point.
Even to remember even matrací producers who, in the 'pánských' used změkčující zone precisely in the field of shrug.
Women also remember - those dopřávají softer surface again in places kyčlí.
For nejnáročnější customers are addressed to křidélkové or destičkové rošty with so-called multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure was disintegrating into more points and reduces the tensions.
But beware, once you on the right matraci and rošt bad backstop (great and 'naducaný'), most 'plus' will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: backstop is podepírat head and elite only intervene to ramenům, to be able to release ramenní muscles.
As the appropriate size of recommends 50 X 60 height, which show that, for example, in Scandinavia.
In the camps on the side should backstop balance (along with ramenní the cradle of roštu or změkčenou zone in matraci) height ramene.
Modern matrace have with the original slamníky plněnými travinami, after all, something in common.
Their manufacturers is increasingly use natural materials or at least ingredients.
The trend is simply for matrací bio.
Raw materials from oil, of which are produced polyuretanové foaming are replaced by natural oleji, for example, from skočce and soya beans.
Just soybean use perhaps all known for producers.
'bio for matrací means that the core is produced from material purely natural origin,' explains the Peter vašíček from firms tropico plus.
Natural substances are used in the production of potahů matrací, one of the first was aloe Vera.
But you can also afford mikrokapsle that you uvolňovala fresh odour of forest or levandule.
There is also the division for men and women.
While men 'cooling' rostlinný extrakt from břízy to potah matrace absorboval heat and ochladil body, on the contrary, women potahy 'drowning'.
Extrakt from red blood circulation papriček increases, so it is less gender tepleji.
Today's favorites?
Matrace produced from the cold foaming (has more póry with porušenou brave structure, is so prodyšnější than normal polyuretan and offers better elasticitu.
A combination of different tuhostí cold pěn and 'lazy' foam vícezónové matrace arise, which know exactly where it has to be the head of, the shoulders and heels.
For the quality of the matraci you pay so from seven thousand kronor and.
Those that comply with health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical equipment.
As the first achieved in the Czech Republic to this advantage gumotex.
Economising on matraci and roštu is not easy.
Sometimes we can use to the actions of the producers and retailers who offer matrace two for the price of one.
The label must be magniflex offers matraci duofreeze with všitou paměťovou pěnou by into potahu for 11 Amendment 990 kronor.
The second is, however, already held free.
The era of líných or viskoelastických pěn with open brave structure and high hustotou was' a space 'pace material tempur.
Arose originally as material for NASA, because in startech astronauts on were subjected to an enormous congestion.
Tempur in to keep themselves warm měkne in chladnu, on the contrary, zpevňuje.
The human body teplému so perfectly adapted to a setback, and then its pressure.
It is therefore an ideal against the emergence of proleženin, but also for an increase in the comfort in their sleep.
Viskoelastické foam used not only on matrace, but also on the health of the products to be on the special a cushion under their feet, which odlehčují nohám and žilnímu system.
Tuzemští manufacturers use, for example, pěnu eucatherm C or twinsaver and so on and so forth.
Appliances on monitoring the people want to increasingly parents want so uhlídat their children
Fear for their own child brings more and more people to the idea of guard over the GPS.
The system originally stvořený for the search for cars, it may also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in such cases, which is the disappearance of devítileté aničky janatkové.
So far, the equipment is about as large krabička from sirek soon, but it can be a great just as clockwork.
Many people terrorized case aničky disappeared and the quest for resources, how better to protect their children.
Even at the cost of the distortion of their privacy.
'We are all saying that this is not about any spy, but on the other means to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy,' says Peter wood from society macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
'I admit that in a certain case can lead to the abuse of such equipment, when in bags of someone who knows about this, but we have with such a case not.'
'majority that really customers buy for reasons of security,' add wood.
According to him, would always child should know what purpose 'krabička' serves and how it is used in the case of an emergency.
Child psycholožka Dan bočková draws attention to the fact that if a child will want to nothing similar to wear, quite simply, discarded.
'very small children show a great deal of creativity in how some things schválně lose, when they do not want to be under the control of the'.
The 'great expectations incited earlier for parents phones, which, however, can turn off as well as this monitoring equipment,' says the bočková.
Accordingly, it is questionable whether, in the case of the attack really such facilities help.
'with regard to the forthcoming kidnapping, ensure the perpetrator are virtually always to ourselves child should no electronics, which could reveal its geography.'
'It is now that the phone.'
'when they begin to expand monitoring facilities, will seek is because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising'.
'In the case of criminals are always one step ahead of this before the police, "says psycholožka.
It acknowledges, however, that such facilities can help in the event of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert Czechs from society RC monitoring, which offers the monitoring services for cars, so for people, even in the case of when it comes after the attack on the immediate destruction of surveillance equipment can his presence of aid.
'equipment can be set for regular send location after a certain time.'
'If the damage will be available for at least the last position of the person concerned.'
'more expensive equipment have, which is built and náklonometry, so, even if only one uklouzl and remained nehybně lie immediately send the device warnings with udáním location,' says the Czechs.
According to him, a similar service can do even smart mobile phones with navigací, where just nahrát and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either on appliances similar přívěskům size packs from sirek or smaller mobile phones.
Always so threatens their loss.
According to the pilina from the macro Weil is therefore now being tested vypadající facilities as ordinary digital clockwork.
'this will have the greatest advantage in the fact that the aggressor may not monitoring facilities at all.'
Or is it 'will only after some time and that it can give the police the extra time,' gives.
Whatever monitoring facilities put into náramků or přívěsků, will continue to use the same technology, which is used to guard the vehicles.
It is a combination of mobile-phone location through the GSP system (which use the normal autonavigace) and the function of the mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.
The army has zápalných cord banks that would obmotaly the Czech Republic last but only two years.
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometres of cord banks, which they fire explosives.
Already last year at the same time, the Defense Ministry supplied in stores 224 kilometres of cord banks.
The army has stocks at 225 years.
The problem is that a cord banks is two, a maximum of four years.
The army's zápalné cord from stock stv group, Inc. for 40 million kronor.
The general staff in the justification for the purchase of such a huge amount of zápalných cord banks mf today's that soldiers in the training to consume 60 kilometres zápalnic per year.
From the military calculations pyrotechniků which mf appeal today, however, that it would be very intensive pyrotechnickým training every year had to go through all the generals, officers command of the army, secretaries or cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and the army chief of staff vlastimila picka including.
Only then would justify the annual consumption army 60 kilometres zápalnic.
This corresponds to the length of the 25 000 eruptions.
And even if it really was the reserves of the army would vystačily for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it was true that the basic training of each new professional just the utmost two metres zápalné cord, as the experts say, so the army fresh buying ensure - and the increased consumption of ženijních or special units - stocks on the 225 years.
The rapid deployment of troops brigades, while Minister Vondra recently personally accusing that have almost no bullets to do it in the ručních weapons, so that they are also shootings because of the shortage of money.
The lack of their underwear.
'me that this is also the head of the does not take that from buying US repeatedly such large amounts of zápalnic.'
'but it is their decision and certainly know what they will be'.
'for the US, the army is a good customer as traders, whom we are trying to comply with,' says the business manager stv group John děcký.
Department of Defense spokesman John pejšek rationalize hundreds of kilometres nakupované cord that army will have stocks of this' munitions' for at least ten years.
John děcký from stv group, however, is only a four-year lifetime mileage zápalnice and police or military pyrotechnici even just about two years.
'In a perfect storage of this can also be those four, "says one of them, which as soldier due to the criticism of the military does not publish the name.
After a lifetime mileage must each munitions carefully tested, whether it is still reliable and threatens soldiers on life.
These tests, however, are not free of charge, and they cost more money.
Another argument Ministry is quantitative rebate on 445 kilometres zápalných cord banks.
'cost us about the sixty per cent less than last year's supply of two hundred 44 kilometres,' it conveys the speaker pejšek position nákupčích Defense Department.
For the sake of comparison: the annual consumption launch cord banks police pyrotechniků who destroy munitions from the second world war or the following the Soviet army, doesn't exceed its for several years of 1 500 metres.
And the police order always just such a number of that this ammunition spotřebovala even before the expiry of working life.
In fact it for the sake of security pyrotechniků, and can, moreover, more flexibly to obtain more modern and, therefore, more reliable types of cord banks.
The Defense Ministry has already considerable difficulties with the removal of the tens of thousands of tonnes of bombs from the Warsaw Pact, when Czechoslovakia's army completely annihilated prepared to campaign on the Rhine.
Here the Czech according to pyrotechniků which mf today has approached, waiting for a few years, the same problem: the will to dispose of hundreds of kilometres of the old zápalnic, which today 'inexpensive' purchases.
Still čerpám from the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The victorious place in competition trader year helped lukáši pytlounovi in the sale of franšízy his hotel.
The winner of the last year competition trader year became osmadvacetiletý entrepreneur lukáš pytloun from liberce.
His story of success is as of the film.
Lukáš pytloun I travelled.
And abroad realized that in liberci lacking high-quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From the savings from foreign brigades and through the banking credit polorozbořený bought the house with five flats.
That was then a student of the third class high school, it was a great courage.
'the ratio between the quality and price of accommodation for us not given me to do something in this nezkusil, "says lukáš pytloun.
The first zrekonstruovaný apartment began to rent foreign workers.
All profit invested, back to the House, which gradually předělal on penzion with 54 bed nets.
Since then, the him for seven years of business gradually managed in liberci open four penziony, two stylové restaurants and two hotels with the overall capacity over 300 nets all categories of accommodation.
Nejkomfortnější of them was until recently a four-star hotel pytloun design.
This year it but find themselves with another, equally high quality.
'We have just signed a contract with reducing in the island for tisé, where we have sold our franšízingový concept of hotels and other client franšízu pytloun subscribes, "says last trader number one.
'and on the sale of a licence to operate a hotel has contributed to a large extent, it is a victory in the competition trader year' gives pytloun highly.
The victory of the him brought greater knowledge and popularity in liberci and environs.
'I am poznávali people on the streets, often me even additional gratulovali and I must say that it was a pleasant,' recalls.
Participation in the competition strongly recommends to all those who have something is trying to do.

It says that still derive from the contacts and známostí to which perhaps not or otherwise.
'with some that I met thanks to the competition, I began regularly trade'.
Cheers for associated with success according to him by the somewhat and for every worker.
And that is around sedmdesátky.
'I see in them greater loyalty and pride in the fact that the accounts for something which has received general recognition.'
'It is not far from just my personal success, it is the result of good work of all of us together'.
'My name is vystrčeno to the fore, "says today modestly lukáš pytloun.
I wish my successor calmer year than we had in farmetu
The euphoria of victory quickly gave way to the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the cílevědomosti winners, however, has farmet worse times for us.
For the price for first place in the last year competition Vodafone company in the House last year, reached slovanském owner firms farmet, Karl žďárský.
The jury then to appreciate the efforts through which built from a small nástrojářské workshops in the Czech skalici business with stamilionovými obraty.
'I can say that the award encourage not only me but all my collaborators and increased self-confidence of us for the struggle with competition, "says today last winner.
At the beginning of the history of the firms farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state has offered a father Karl žďárského to rent one small dílničku as compensation for property which was seized by the Communists, did not hesitate to for a long time, refused to career in the company, where then worked, and with a few friends around his táty establish firm on plastic bathtub.
Soon later started to specialise in presses vegetable oils.
After 18 years of them has become the biggest producers of automatic lisů in Central Europe.
Greater awareness and between neodbornou public the company received after the success in competition through the media.
'not only our customers have seen brand farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that cooperation with the company, which has achieved in their country greater success, "says Karl žďárský.
Last year, however, has not been in farmetu only in a sign of the euphoria of vítězsví.
The award was based on the economic results of firms in 2008 and only partly from the year 2009.
And this is 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of goods they.
During the height of the crisis, which is still so many nedotýkala citizens, but companies already zastavovaly their investment projects, and started to reduce purchases of new machines, and technology.
'This situation is, of course, no nor us.'
'sales fell by 40%, we have had to reduce production and there is also on layoffs,' explains the Karl žďárský.
Viable company must be able to do sometimes even such unpopular measures.
The situation but managed to maintain and firm in profit, even if the smaller than before the crisis.
What, however, in farmetu neslevili is investment in research and development.
'from the subsidies we have built the research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation on international veletrzích won the prize in domestic exhibitions, "says žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales of increasing again and with them and the number of new staff.
The 'new winners I wish a pleasant feeling of victory, but in calmer atmosphere' vzkazuje Karl žďárský.
Poll, which removes the nonsensical regulations
Poll on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of business competitions.
Some pointless legislation has already been abolished.
Neslavným winner next year exit absurdity year has become the obligation to wear the office of documents, which are also officials accessible online.
This was decided by more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security require paper land from the commercial register, even if it can obtain official two kliknutími mice.
Thanks to the anketě this to change.
'The Czech social security administration already land from the commercial register in the controls for paying premiums will require' spokesman said čssz John buraňová.
Posvítit on all the rules and regulations, which must businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to fulfil, and these absurd is the raison d'être of competition to abolish the absurdity of the year.
It is this fourth part of the championship competitions between the economic and the public are becoming more popular.
If the last year about three thousands of voters took part in the vote, this year, there have been almost four thousand.
And it is no wonder, all kinds of legal obligations, which serves only to delay the business, is still with us.
'in the number of just churning out more pages for granting tax on the leading places in the world,' notes that Karl havlíček from associations of small and medium-sized businesses and businesses the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business has in recent years become avowed aim of all the governments.
Compared with the rest of the world, but particularly in the Czech Republic, the situation is not improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic, from the point of view of the conditions for entrepreneurship ranks 74. position, this is about eight jobs worse off than last year.
Competition absurdity year was first proclaimed in 2006, and there is every year, according to the same scenario.
Přihlašovat administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone since April each year by the end of September, when it is accounts competition.
To registration serves web address www.firmaroku.cz then host competition selects seven candidates on the 'anticenu' and will vote for it in the course of October the public via the Internet on websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
An absurdity, which receives the most votes.
In this year's exit přihlášena was more than a hundred or, more precisely, 105 legislation and regulation lacking sense.
Tipy sent to entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Between 'finalisty' competition between leave so that, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of motorways and speed up paying road tolls, or to entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two agents and two toaletami malovali every two years.
The list of this year's sedmičky proposals is published on the website of competition.
The declaration of competition, which is always at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenningu, which regularly attends the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, the culmination of competition asistovala Eva svobodová, Director of the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and businesses the Czech Republic or Peter kužel chambers of commerce, the President of the Czech Republic.
'economic prosperity cannot operate there, where the state impedes entrepreneurs's wheel, therefore, it is my aim to abolish every year at least three dozens of paragraphs, which today only unnecessarily complicated business, "he told Minister of Industry and Trade Martin kocourek.
The attempt to abolish senseless regulation nevyznívá flat.
In 2007 the people most vadila duty entrepreneurs to three days ahead živnostenskému office in the place where it is located permanent place, the intention to go with the booth for an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been removed novelou živnostenského law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in 2007, which has been reporting labour office for their foreign workers within the scope of the way until 30 days have been eliminated the law on the so-called green card.
And the third time lucky.
Absurdity 2009 happened regulation fyzioterapeutům have in ordinaci large mirror, ledničku and two land weight.
It was in this year through the Ministry of Health zmírněno - the obligation to have ledničku saw.
A new category of appreciation for the socially responsible companies
Assessment of the environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
What is new in this year already the fifth year competition economic newspaper is category called responsible firm by 2010.
The mission of this competition is support for a reasonable and fair entrepreneurship.
'We want to support such firms, which take into account the effects of their business on the environment and support the socially responsible activities, "says Patrik bartholdy, regional manager Vodafone mobile operator, firms, which is vyhlašovatelem and the guarantor of competition as well as in the case of competition on rebela year.
In this first year of this special podkategorie main competition Vodafone firm 2010 sign up companies, for which there is no success in the business of the long-term goal.
The story of each of them is a very inspiring and issued to a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities, one from the other vastly different, for the common denominator of their efforts can be seen support and consideration.
In one case concerns, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Between 14 celorepublikovými finalisty finds itself, for example, Prague software company et netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams between employees, who are then in a series of turnajů in various sports.
Another example responsible companies from pardubického provinces is isolit-bravo society, which is already seventeen years the main contributor nadačního fund sponzorujícího disabled children.
On its disabled employees, in turn, the old papírna from poděbrad, which it has more than 70%, and thus the title of responsible companies středočeského provinces and in competition Vodafone firm year is placed in the region as the third.
On olomoucku won accounting firm miryz soft, which introduce flexible working hours, even, moreover, reduced to the average 35 hours per week, but without commensurate with the false salary.
The title of the jury to grant it also for the fact that, as a priority, bought from the Czech producers, supports civil activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
'We are trying to recycle as much as possible to our businesses and our administration should what the lowest possible impact on the environment,' explains jednatelka miluše ryznarová.
Responsible it firm enlogit from ústeckého provinces, in turn, is the health of their workers and laptop on each of them an ergonomické chairs and klávesnice supports their work from home and on its corporate actions uses cateringové services provided by the local protected's workshop.
'In addition, we support the people in distress, which helps specifically local Roma community, "says that firms Ondřej dry.
Last but not least, is also worth noting activity firms money and cleaning of karlovarského provinces, that their workers in the form of nadstandardních bonuses contributes to their supplementary pension rights.
'for us, we are giving the contributions on diet, transport, improving qualifications and recreational, "says Joseph strapáč from bruntálské construction firms czasch, winners in moravskoslezském province.
Into the category of responsible firm year were automatically přihlášeni all krajští finalisté competition Vodafone firm year, who answered questions the questionnaire attached to apply and send it by no later than 15 August pořadateli.
Never incorrectly or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then pořadatelem removed from the evaluation.
'If the representatives of competing firms provided answers to the questions, could not have competition responsible firm year to attend, but they are not diskvalifikováni from' major 'competition Vodafone firm year.'
'separate affirmations only into this competition is not possible, as it is a podkategorii main competition firm year' explains the Karl Goldman from pořadatelské agencies bison & Rosa.
On pozemkovém fund in plzni police zatýkala in public competition
In building pozemkového fund in plzni in recent days zatýkala anti-corruption police.
Želízka detektivové muzzle local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and obchodníkovi with real luboši G.
The reportedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to the handling of restitution claims to plot of land nabízený in competition concrete entrants.
He had for this luboši G. pay half a million kronor.
'So far, I can only confirm that the police is dominated by one person for the pletichy in public tender and in public competition,' said law plzeňského Secretary of State representations antonie Green that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot provide.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs police after 24 hours released on freedom.
For how can public competition influence can be given the low official information only speculate.
The speaker pozemkového fund lubomíra black on the question of the rights of the said that at the workplace in odloučeném plzni really accompanied by police officers, and that during the public competition.
'It was a client who, not of our employees' specify.
Public competition is according to the black right name 'call for lodging claims on the supply of the transfer of land in the law on the soil' and is taking place in a case where the nabízený plot of land to show an interest in more legitimate asylum seekers.
'these people in the framework of the challenges they offer a higher value of their restitution claims that are to be addressed by transferring than it was vyhlašovaná the value of the land'.
'under offered claims sets out the order nabyvatelů and land fund then převede plot of land person, which offer the highest claims,' to explain the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. should probably information, who has signed up to the challenges, and because he is also justified person skoupil because many of the restitution of entitlements, offered the candidates on the plot of land that competition will not be there.
For this apparently inkasoval severance payments.
This would explain that it had in the detention of such a large sum of money.
Luboš G. should the privileged contacts at PF in plzni has already in the past.
There was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav sankota, which was criminalise being prosecuted for issuing in spare restitution of land which has already been a decision on the location of the construction.
It is then gained luboš G. from the Fund, for example, land for the construction of public communications, namely in the place where we should build příjezdová magistrála into industrial zones borská fields.
Later it is very favourably směnil with magistrátem for the House in the historic city centre, which should the value of the much higher.
Then the city had to accede to it, because otherwise, by blocking the construction of the land.
Households to housing připlatí hundreds of monthly
Households will have to since January připlatit not only for all types of energy, but also for the water charges and stočné, the supply of heat and somewhere to grow even nájmy.
Families so since January will have to pull out of the pockets of up to hundreds of kronor per month, more than we do now.
Electricity will push up the cost of up to 4.6%, gas will be about 2% more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities, you will have to připlatit for water supply and also supply or podraží central heating.
More expensive electricity should households in homes come stokoruny more than a year now.
The price of electricity at the same time, all the main suppliers reduce, the blame is therefore a significant increase in the support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially fotovoltaiky.
Gas will become more expensive while slightly, but at a time when most people are drowning and are so high consumption.
A year must therefore also count on hundreds of kronor.
While the electricity and gas will become more expensive for the whole of the Republic, the change in the prices of central heating, different place from jobs.
The increase in the price of planned mainly greater Community.
For example, households in pardubicích or hradci kings pay since January for the central heating about 50 kronor per month, moreover, of more than 1,000 kronor per year pay families in liberci.
The people of Prague, there is a risk that the them by more than 9% will push up the cost of water charges and stočné, and that in the event that the city of increase rent of infrastructure.
If the rent change, připlatí, pražené 6.8%.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between the lower.
In the north, where the Czechs now prices are among the highest has water charges and stočné podražit by 7.4%.
Significantly, for example, may rise in the prices of rent in the 450 thousands of nájemních flats where since January ends regulation.
For example, the company CPI apartments, which has resulted in over Labem own about 2500 flats intends to since January rent increase up to 100%.
Those who do not agree with the new annual rent, does it intend to give to the company to the Court.
Regulated nájmy, which is approximately 300 people in thousands of homes, next year could rise by up to 10% of the total.
The Czech children opíjejí fernetem and rumem. Beer is going out of fashion, takes slowly
Fernet, rum vodka, exceptionally, the better the label whisky ukradená parents.
These are the drinks, for whose vypití ends up most often in the care of doctors opilci, which has not yet been or fifteen years.
The exception, which are not children from monkeys treated in hospital repeatedly.
This stems from the experience of doctors, who are faced with similar cases on the revenues of the separation of the hospitals.
'a beer or wine are completely nemódní, because it takes a long time to opijete them.'
'trend is certainly a tough alcohol,' the right of children's hospital department told primář hořovice in medium-sized Bohemia luděk Pelikán.
'when they will be able to play a bottle tatínkovi from cupboards, so it is to be a whisky, otherwise, but the dominant Fernet and vodka'.
'vodka has the advantage that it pump billions into the juice and is not so many of them feel' primář explained.
And for the right also gives him the spokesman for the fakultní hospitals motol Eva jurinová.
All this is often 'Fernet or rum'.
'that is modern alcohol especially at primary schools'.
'in some cases, it was a slivovici that brought from home,' said jurinová.
According to the primáře pelikána are 13 or čtrnáctiletí drinkers in the hospital income quite commonplace.
Before hořovicemi where there are starting this year, ten years worked on pediatrii in motole where sanitky svážejí podroušené školáky from a broad surroundings.
'One girl in us lay around four times'.
'career launched in twelve years, when it brought to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood, moreover, in combination with the extází' described the doctor particularly serious case.
"was výstavišti in holešovicích on any dance Party '.
'interesting is that her mother not at all strange that, on his daughter 48 hours did not know' podivil with primář.
It is lack of parents or even their considerable tolerance towards popíjení own offspring is considered to be the main cause of the growing child pijanství.
About dependence in the true sense of the word, however, according to the experts in children to speak.
Under the concept of 'alkoholik means několikaletá chronic dependence on alcohol are all phenomena that they belong to, and this for children is not'.
'for those that alcohol use repeatedly, is rather symptomatic failed rodinně-sociální background,' explained primář Pelikán.
According to the spokesman for the jurinové this year on paediatric clinic in motole hospitalizovali in the middle of November around forty opilých children.
In the statistics, they will receive only those with a severe intoxikací, which had to remain in hospital.
Child opilci that after ambulantním treatment odvezou parents or home is shipped police, does not count.
In addition to the cases where the children just seated after school and vypijí kořalky pelikána according to you, there are three seasonal fluctuations, on which we can rely: witch-hunt, silvestr and the end of the school year.
'either zapíjejí sorrow for the wrong diplomas, or, on the contrary, hailed the start of the holiday.'
'But witch-hunt, I experienced on income and seven children's opilců suddenly Pelikán,' said.
Opilec, who spend a night detoxikací under the supervision of doctors, is, paradoxically, in advantage compared to the fact that the second day at home vytrpí unpleasant hangover.
The heads of the morning of pain caused by dehydrated and lack of glukózy, satisfies zavodňovací infuze with glukózou and by nutrients that organism lacking.
'They are, in fact, the better, because they are after two evenings ago marvellous experience and good awakening and nothing is nebolí.'
'only are confusion from where these are' Pelikán admitted that sometimes zkazí patients pleasant mood at least a list of costs, which their treatment cost.
The transportation sanitkou hospitalization and on an acute bed, costs and tens of thousands of kronor.
'I have sometimes it applied as an educational tool, when I am directly to those children then vizitě has on how much their drunkenness, and that could also spend throughout the summer on brigade to earn on the one party, add' Pelikán.
Health insurance, according to him, however, to regresním management, in which, after the parents vymáhaly the cost of treatment, in cases of child opilců nepřistupují.
Two aircraft l-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two aircraft l-159 out of a total of five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defence vyměnilo transport a c-295m Casa, on Tuesday odletěly into the Spanish sevilly, where aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
This is the first time that the machines of this type have appeared in the ownership of someone else than the Czech army.
Abroad has only been to mere or předváděcích years.
It is about dvoumístné l-159t1 version which has been undertaken by the Czech army and which were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are jednomístné l-159.
Yet those costs zakonzervované in aeru vodochody and broker trade - firm omnipol - is already taken last week.
When aircraft physically some from vodochod, not according to John pejška from the press's Department of Defense yet known.
'jednomístné l-159 aircraft have been earmarked for the conversion of the long-term imposed aircraft, and this without further savings and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry of'.
'dvoumístné l-159t1 were converted into the current situation and form, "said the right pejšek.
To add that the army without dvoumístných aircraft will be left, because the ministry in May 2009 has signed with aerem vodochody Treaty in the value of 200 million kronor on rebuilding the four useless machines l-159 on two dvoumístné machines.
One has assumed a new army in July, the second takes until the end of this year.
According to the EADS pejška pledged that aircraft equipment prevails in some of the NATO countries.
'in the Treaty is clearly stated that odběratelem aircraft l-159 is company EADS and will serve to training pilots from the NATO countries.'
'is therefore odběratele things the way this matter will be implemented,' said pejšek.
Economic newspapers recently said that, for example, the Spanish army on the l-159 has no interest.
The exchange of five l-159 for one a Casa and the purchase of the other three aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor approved last year, the government Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry nevypsalo on the purchase of selective management and addressing directly EADS.
The leadership of defense argument went by směnou support the future exports l-159 abroad.
The Czech army from aera bought 72 machinery and used only 24, the rest would sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will have probably even judicial aftermath.
The European Commission is the Czech Ministry of Defence moved against in the European Court, therefore, that we should choose the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tendru and not oslovením one producers.
The army has already taken over the last three aircraft Casa should on the Prague airport kbely land in 14 days.
A longer ukazováček than prsteníček signify a lower risk of cancer
The men who have ukazováček longer than prsteníček are less exposed to the risk of ill prostate cancer.
This is surprising conclusion by the study on Wednesday, the British magazine cancer.
It can to relate to the surface of the male hormone testosteronu.
'our results show that the length of their relative can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risks, especially for men in 60 years,' said study co-author of Ros eelesová, Professor Institute for cancer research in the university in warwicku.
A finger would thus could help to determine who men should take test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with the genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, add eelesová.
In the period 1994-2009 followed with my colleagues in the UK more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer and in parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants study should ukazováček on the right hand shorter than prsteníček.
For them to apply the same the likelihood of prostate cancer as for 19% of those whose fingers have been as long.
In the case of those who have ukazováček longer than prsteníček, however, this risk has fallen by 33% for men into šedesátky drop even 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingerprints - utvářených in prenatálním period - probably reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which is exposed to the child in the womb.
Less testosteronu corresponds to the prolonged ukazováčku.
Earlier studies have shown that it is precisely the testosteron supports the growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech genetik and the former President of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav pačes for čtk said, that this study briefly knows, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingerprints and cancer was completely 'proven'.

Drivers should sjíždět just for brnem on 190. kilometre of or go through Brno and najíždět then on 182. kilometre of on kývalce.
There are několikakilometrové columns.
Also on the motorway d11 is an accident, and now with the arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies několikacentimetrová layer snow, teploměry show minus seven degrees centigrade.
Columns of cars, for example, to create proseku, closed is also štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is metro.
Trams drive with delays, for example, the line between karlovým náměstím and náměstím peace.
In the eight morning has once again sit at the Prague crisis staff.
With the problems they face also railways and airports.
The Czech railways already have to snow to abolish the seven rychlíkových cancellations.
The problems, for example, has a line from Prague to kralup or from Prague to berouna.
Passengers should control the current situation.
Ruzyně airports were closed since středečních 11 o'clock at night in five in the morning.
The majority of the roads and on to the South moravě is already sjízdná, but only the increased caution.

Bullets to do it can be naprogramovat so that vybuchnou upon impact not only on the objectives, but in any point in its ballistic trajectories.
It is, therefore, can be used against the enemy, which is behind some obstacle for walls or in zákopu.
From the top, usually protected is not, and when to withstand the murderous rain steel střepin, can it to exclude from this fight.
According to Richard audetta, who was involved in the development of xm-25 is a new puška first weapon for corps, which uses' smart 'technology.
'soldier with it in principle, are treated so that a target, it will send out a laser beam, which will determine the distance and receives upřesněný deliberate point, according to him, regulates náměr and it will squeeze tap'.
'Let us say that you naměřili 543 metres.'
'When stisknete havoc, weapon is nabije guided missile at a distance and exploding a 543 metres of plus or minus one, two or three metres,' said audette.

Fujitsu-koncern from Tokyo is what is known as the third largest it-provider in the world.
It offers for example, companies computers and servery available and old is also needed service.
A branch in the area of the Rhine and mohanu is one of the biggest in Germany, the most Fujitsu workers, but it is in Munich.

Amazon vypíná's - threats against assangemu
WikiLeaks is in dire straits.
Internet service Amazon switch off on their serverech platform for detection.
It is possible that this has happened on the political pressure after the publication of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depeší.
WikiLeaks founder Assange has reportedly resident in Great Britain.
WikiLeaks, the platform for detection, in the United States under increasing pressure.
Online activists lost access to their date domovskému server in America, and now looking for Internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, called a prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman other countries and companies to award ceremony WikiLeaks.
And the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, which is conducted on the list by Interpol is to delay according to one press contribution in Great Britain.
WikiLeaks' is no longer on the server Amazon. '
'free speech in the country free', told the activists publication of service short reports Twitter Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet society Amazon documents Wikileaks has withdrawn from its servers.
Online activists used in the publication of secret diplomatic depeší Amazon web service (AWS), so that they can cope with the high number of approaches to documents.
With the help of the services Twitter explained to this step: WikiLeaks' fine - our dollars now we spend that zaměstnáme people in Europe '.
If it has the Amazon such problems with freedom of expression, 'then should stop to sell books'.
Amazon stopped using their Web for WikiLeaks after supposedly associates Senator Joe liebermana carried out a search, published on CNN TV station on the basis of the information offices liebermana.
The President of the Senate of the Committee for the defence of the home of the Amazon threatened boycott inform the British 'Guardian'.
'I would have wished that Amazon acceded to this step before, given the earlier through the publication of classified information on the WikiLeaks', said senator.

WikiLeaks' is illegally, blatantly and ruthlessly and that is our national security exposed to danger and threatens the lives of all over the planet ', said in a statement nestranického senator.
'No responsible company - either the US or foreign - should not WikiLeaks to assist in their efforts to expand stolen from the material'.

Hrafnsson responded probably on the statements from North America.
In America, asked the previous Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, so that the person who was responsible for the publication of the WikiLeaks because of betrayal of accusations and executed.
In Canada said in television one Head of Government adviser Stephen Harper - perhaps ironic, Assange should be 'captors' and Obama could use a 'target'.
In the meantime, unleashed a between the White House and Assange verbal the shoot-out.
The spokesman for the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it 'a ridiculous and shambolic' that Assange has asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for the recently published spy challenges of diplomats.
'I am not quite sure why we are concerned about the opinion of one person with by websites,' said Gibbs.
'our foreign policy and the interests of the countries are much more important than its Web site'.

Zmrzlinová University
On the 'gelato university' in boloně preparing zmrzlinoví cukráři on better annual period.
The basic rate for future zmrzlináře, which is three days, there is a great deal of interest and přijíždí visitors from around the world.
Where, in fact, the latter zmrzlina takes?
From gelatiere and from gelataio.
Gelatiere, česky bit zastarale zmrzlinář, produces lotion according to all the rules of the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio vyndá stěrkou ice cream from chladícího boxu, setře cake being served in and sells.
To see this, you do not need to go into the anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about the zmrzlině, it will not shirk 'gelato-university' the Italian firms carpigiani.
In 2003, to establish a manufacturer zmrzlinových machinery zmrzlinovou university to zmrzlina from his machinery matches everywhere high Italian ideals.
The basic rate for future gelatieri, which is three days ago, is a huge interest and přijíždí visitors from around the world.
It offers, but also několikadenní special rates on chocolate zmrzlině and praktika in their own zmrzlinárně.
Someone aspire to in its midlife-crisis after the new career, others are daring on thin ice their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, teacher from California, art, loves slow-food movement in the future and I would offer high-quality European product in the country industrial ice-cream.
Anke from Berlin is podniková konzultantka and I would be for the years spent stressful work start something of their own.
Two young an Egyptian woman dreaming that in kairu zmrzlinárnu open.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil, they want to improve the quality of zmrzliny in their bars - and the Canadian woman in households Yulia arrived, because its children love the Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explain the participants in the ideal characteristics perfect zmrzliny.
The decisive is not only good taste, but also the Silk hebkost and good consistency.
Forgotten by Luciano during their training on jižanskou and their třešničku on the cake: 'the Italian gelato is simply that the best - and then this is still a good dose of romantiky.'
The first step in the production of seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserted the basic ingredients šlehačku milk, milk, sugar and stabilisers into a great mixéru, which all become much warmer electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately cool on four degrees.
Then count on engine kohoutkem and vyteče pasterizovaný White basic lotion, the basis for all types of milk zmrzlin.
It is immediately associate Professor zasypán issues: it is possible to produce only eat from natural substances without Stabilizer?
How can you yourself experiment?
Luciano warning to get carried away by the spirit of the times, into the unknown.
Who is talking about the zmrzlině 'only from natural ingredients', probably as used stabilisers - the majority of the natural product, such as guarová mouka from guarových zrnek.
It is, of course, possible to produce ice cream even without stabilizers, but must be sold in one day, otherwise it will bring the customer and the same ice zrnka.
Some variation fundamental matter are leave.
It will be with napínavější aromatickými esencemi.
Luciano distinction for taste zmrzliny according to the ingredients, which is the purchase of either in a supermarket in the separation of fruit or in the separation of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
'suppliers you will seek to impose a lot of aromatised ingredients'.
'You should but simply experiment.'
Either with the dessert sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or zmrzlinou from white fundamental matter, which will change the vajíčky on yellow lotion and kakaem on the basis for všelijaká čokoládová temptation.
Now they are permitted to rate zmrzlinovým strojům.
Luciano is will always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, kávové and lískooříškové zmrzliny - either with egg or without them in the basic hmotě, with more or less vanilkovým properties or other natural přísadami.
There will be the same experiment with dessert zmrzliny species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pyré - given the taste of this is not always better.
Lískooříšková zmrzlina may not chutnat more oříšková when it contains more lískových nuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi fruit produced group, which will be used more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mix of takes up rightly says, the taste of the gelato Luciano.
The production of zmrzliny is purely numerical task: if applies peaches pyré with a lot of sugar, it must be to reduce the share of sugar in the basic ingredients.
For zmrzliny against is the need for extra portion of sugar.
Luciano vyndá device, which determines the content of sugar in the fruit (winemakers this measure must from grapes).
Fortunately, turn the tables.
The production of zmrzliny already does not require much physical effort as before.
Not only the device to automatic production of fundamental matter.
There is also a machine, which is, at the same time, a mixture of zmrzlinovou umíchá into krému and cool on the minus the temperature.
Despite all the automatizaci are inevitable small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo zašpiní themselves and also to my fellow Members from the top downwards ovocným pyré, when he gets out of the control of the huge mixér.
'at any rate', does the Luciano, 'it is only a question of time, when this happens'.
In the light of the dual revizoři
The European food EFSA is linked with the industry, which has experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation is now express group of experts testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
'It sounds like a contrived theory, but that we are well documented', said in the centre in Munich, the head of testbiotechu Christoph then.
The leaders of the group of experts EFSA for gentechnicky modified plants, Harry kuiper, and other expert EFSA have for several years with the Union Treaty ilsi lobbyists.
This is financed by concerns such as Monsanto, nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way to control legislation EFSA for genetic plants and stands in clear conflict of interests, criticises then.
The regulations of the EFSA to agree in the entire paragraphs with documents ilsi and bear so script industry, which should be monitored by the office in the Italian parmě.
This is already the second time what testbiotech draws attention to the conflict of interests.
Recently the icy high manažerka from EFSA without amendments or a transitional period to the Swiss agrárnímu group Syngenta - and this has changed sides.
Also the radio for central Germany (mdr) revealed recently staffing interconnection eu-úřadu for control with the industrial lobby, which has aroused interest of both the Ministry for the environment, as Members of the EU.
In the meantime, cannot EFSA to recognise the conflict of interests.
Working with all the serious data, thus also those of industry, if they are highly professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
From the experts who are working for the EFSA, is not required to have contacts with the industry.
But it must demonstrate.
Kuiper recognizes its work for international life sciences Institute (ilsi) in the US.
In itself it is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from industry and science policy - among other things for the assessment of the risks of biotechnology without Treaty lobbyists.
Independent experts as then criticise that are currently leave gentechnicky modified plants without any attempt in the animal feed, and that netestuje response genetic products on the effects of the environment.
'We want to know what to do, for example, gentechnicky amended maize in the field of', then says.
The current practice is only test isolated proteins and not the whole of the genetic rostlinu, which nedoloží reliable results.
'if they are not looking for an risk, as it was then it is possible to find?', he is asking žalobně then.
Agrees and Angelika hilbeck.
The scientific worker examining gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on a technical high school in Zurich.
In this field, attempting to industry, as well as in the US, and now also in Europe still more influence or discredit the critical scientists.
This is why almost there are scientists who would not be associated with the concerns.
The majority nepublikují studies, which are critical for society.
'industry controls the security research', does the hilbeck.
Footprint cornerstones of
Uli gsell also some acquired, a total of around 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening before nádražím in stuttgartu, tubu on the back.
The demonstrations.
Sněžilo.
The story is known: in September přijely bagry and began began tearing down a great deal of northern wing.
The world in stuttgartu has been the same: thousands of demonstrating against s21, miliardovému reduction of the station.
When it has achieved a cessation of the construction of the majority of the wings, lay in ruins.
Rozbité at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Vápenec from crailsheimu, soft gross block, which is used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in ostfildern, 43 years.
Assuring a few of these slices.
'these blocks are relikvie.'
'must not disappear.'
Being dissolved: 'cheap and poor cornerstone, simple and ancestral.'
When one rozřízl, smrděl after cigaretovém smoke.
What about those pieces will do even knows.
Stones have time.
Uli gsell too.
Footprint blocks from stuttgartu leads to the forest in Tübingen on the former deponii munitions the French army, where Manuel rongen built its straight empire.
44-letý man trades with the old stones.
To buy all which arose during the dismantling in stuttgartu.
'It would be a shame if, rozemlely on štěrk or disappeared on deponii', says in her office, timber booth, which was previously a house.
Tell that he nadávali and jeopardize him when in September in all the newspapers that the remnants of a northern wings from society, which carries out to the demolition of.
But he spoke of the whole days with adversaries S-21.
And explain to them that for at all to the demolition of cannot.
And if this happens, then it is surely reasonable, when the stones continue to use it.
Then we take around 200 s-21-protivníků every one about 80 kilograms of heavy bloc, the price for a piece of 6,50 until 14 of the euro.
As the memory, some also, in the hope that it will come back in the building.
Rongen buy 500 tonnes, cargo 25 large lorries.
About half is still in forests, the rest have long sold.
Gardeners krajinní zahradníci, developers home.
They have come from all corners and odtáhli, as it came into kufru and přívěs.
Stones dispute from stuttgartu with long into 'zídky' or as the záhonů with bylinkami.
'This cornerstone is actually nothing special', says rongen.
'If it had not been for the political vsuvky.'
Nasedá into its terénního cars and goes on projížďku after his 20-ti hektarovém UK.
Studied ahead of rights, the study of speaker later biology, then has studied the computers and ultimately salesman with stones.
And milovníkem blocks.
It has committed 40000 tonnes of blocks.
Your their treasures from the whole of Germany.
It says that it is the largest obchodník with the old cornerstones of the Republic.
.
In the snow lies umělecky opracované pískovce.
'once belonged to marien-most in Dresden,' tell.
Pískovec from labe, yellow, warm, is happy.
'My favourite stone'.
We are going to continue on the path of up through the forest.
It shows a bundle: red pískovec, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And further.
'Fine travertin.'
Again, those kvádry on tribunu neckarstadionu in stuttgartu.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories cannstatt-travertin from the police by the Presidium in stuttgartu, red granit from the temple of St. blasien, tuf from hospitals in heilbronnu.
What work, what hardship, what pot.
When rongen thinks of how before officials by rozbíjely stones and carried through simple kladkostrojů and býčích povozů, it will become totally uctivým.
'It would be a scandal if something drtilo.'
The rich becoming very rich, not at all.
Obchodník with stones but today employs 14 people and, in addition, up to in the forest kameníci settled, one sculptor, one kovář, one sklář and one zahradník.
'We are working hard, but it is satisfying', says the who appreciates residues.
In the foreseeable future must in Cologne.
Also there will be to rescue the stones.
The fight talent on high-potenciály
For food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for chlebíčků with lososem, rajčatové soup and sweets.
The Technical University in braunschweigu and car manufacturers Volkswagen invited students engineering and design the workshop.
Together with the developers firms VW here have to talk about the car of the future - and that is the only way to get to know, incidentally, Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to plant in the cleverest brains, as well as a firm VW to succeed and bets on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: as soon as possible to recruit in posluchárnách most talented graduates, even before we get to the labour market and for them to take an interest in the others.
Since universities are not issued no lists of the success of their students, trying to firms appear exceptional talents in projects oriented to practice and to obtain it.
The braunschweig seeks to motor concern to obtain talent second day.
One young lady from personal decoupling gives propisky, rubber medvídky plates and with the logo VW.
A promising young testament to talent, about the programmes for praktika, student occupations and suggests ways of them in the group.
Nico selle braunschweig from there it is concerned about the project, together with the VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: 'students come into contact with the industry and gain experience'.
'VW can, at the same time, to know the students, closer to familiarise themselves with the very interesting candidates and reconsider, who would, as associate of Erdogan.'
Such cooperation, according to the selle, are not unusual.
Innovation is, however, that is so openly fights for students.
'otherwise was more substantial expert project', says selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will perhaps even starker.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from the long crowd applicants.
It must, on the contrary, to try and try to groom particularly highly qualified labour force.
First of all, graduates of engineering disciplines have excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Union of German engineers vdi remained in October will remain unfilled 40.000 engineering positions.
And according to forecasts, the so-called 'lack of engineers vdi even to grow.
For auditorskou and consulting firm KPMG regard Roman dykta hunting talent.
By demanding recruiting-events, such as kpmg-race, the type of modern race for treasure, must find a way in which the participants in koordinát GPS.
The company is planning the next year to send such eight promising students after the US.
The participants can, at the same time, allow branches KPMG and familiarise themselves with the company.
In advance will be decided in the two rounds of tendering, who will be included in the process.
Only the crème de la crème of many customers will travel to the US.
In the competition for high potentials at universities will pay according to dykty still tougher laws.
'We want with our approach distinguish itself from other'.
'a simple free trip on to a sailor was for us a little power'.
It seems that lovec talent dykta has been lucky.
'We have remained in contact with all the participants similar actions in the last year'.
'some will soon end up studies and planned for us to look for work', he says.
In addition to the direct reaching on campus, above all, small and medium-sized firms present klasicky on the labour markets.
'We are trying to contact the graduates on expert exhibitions.'
'as, for example, of intersolar' claims sitha stübe, leading personnel separation of the manufacturer solar technology solarworld.
A company from Bonn employs in Germany around 1 500 employees.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, it is called 35 positions on websites firms.
'at the present time, it is difficult to fill vacant jobs.'
'It costs a great deal of time and money', he says.
Another possibility is contact over the professors in universities.
Solarworld cooperates with the various universities, such as university in freibergu.
'professors informed that it is possible for us to do praktika or write diplomovou work'.
Solar specialist does no expensive advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: the personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
The 'great concerns that often cannot offer', says the personal decoupling stübe.
In search of work has long play the main role of money.
Flexible working hours, enshrining children or good options procedure are another decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied in one study of the Institute to hold this great work 55. place between 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute an annual draws up a list of best German employers.
In addition, asks aides, how they are satisfied with their work and working environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The leaders of the personal decoupling stübe hopes that it will bring about the location of the points with people wanting to work.
'I believe that people are informed, in particular, on the external assessments of a potential employers', he says.
Wolf Reiner kriegler from German employer branding Academy advises the companies that want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
Instructs its customers to be more autentičtí.
And according to Mr krieglera this means, above all, an internal measures.
'the best way to increase the visibility of the employer as attractive leads through its own employees', he says.
Technically it is called the internal employer branding, thus promoting employers on the market within their own employees.
'happy employees are the best envoys.'
When a company well old on its people and they identify with firm, then they will be themselves do advertising their employers between friends and known.
'It is like a game of provázkem', says kriegler.
Obama is halted new drilling for oil
During the next few years there will be before the Côte us-spolkového state Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, the new oil drilling.
The government in Washington, issued a corresponding ban - and thereby abolishing definitively earlier plans.
Before the Atlantic coast, meanwhile, are new drilling banned.

Commission of Inquiry, which authorised the Obama should produce results during the December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar ban drilling, which has been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently by the various oil concerns requests for new vrtné intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster stricter controls and striktními security legislation.
At the present time, fundamentally reforming supervisory authority, which in themselves out many corrupt accusations.
At the same time, Obama has announced that the possibility of abolishing lucrative tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation fundamentally reducing the volume of těžené oil in the Gulf.
'Government plans are the greatest drag on for the growth of gas and oil industry', is the result of current research in the field of consulting firm bdo - even before the ban on drilling in the centre.
American energy alliance, even this complaining about the uncertainty in the field: 'No one knows exactly what the regulation to change'.
Investments in new mining projects until appeals move - at the expense of growth.
The area of Ogoni shořela
Water in rivers is olejově Brown, stinks of this as the pump: billion litres of oil uniklé destroyed nature in the area of the Ogoni in Nigeria.
People eat kradením, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine akpobari is well.
'netrapte', it is cosying up to the journalist green activist: 'today, you will receive before objektiv even enough oil mess.'
37-letý nigeriánec watched attempt vyfotografovat boy brodí after prsa water, flanked by šmouhy: the scene in water lustre with duhovými colours of the almost to Nice.
The fact that under the surface plavou Brown vascular oil, not to see.
Before here collected in vessels enough garnel, tell Mrs badom on the Bank of the river bodo-jetty.
In the meantime, become slowly arising water entirely dead.
Five years ago spilled into huge vlahé area from broken the leadership of the large quantities of oil.
The fishermen of nedalekého towns Bodo must row at least six hours to get into the waters, where the fish are: the Ogoni, which is at the heart of the Niger Delta belongs to one of the worst contaminated areas in the world.
The way after the river mangrovníkovými bažinami with a lot of the alleys přítoků is only apparent the whole range of spouště.
On the boat engine brewed instead of light water hnědou mess and who plunge their hand into the water olejové unsettling fingers.
The roots of mangrovníků towers from countries such as black tyčky lékořice, rarely occurring Palma are letting their leaves the sad viset.
We are looking for in vain stocks of birds, which normally in wet areas exist: once utichne engine on the boat, rozhostí in earlier havens where it stinks as the pump, scare silence.
'What is happening here is the ecological waging war', says the sad celestine akpobari: 'We live in constant fear of health.'
Compared with the war is justified.
The population is a battlefield Ogoni, where it is already a couple of decades of fighting: more than 60 years ago, the damage here first dobyvatelé from Europe, here, in the early 1980's, utvářel first resistance with later executed and writer, Ken Saro-Wiwa, here had to concern Shell to stop in 1993 its production, because it was for the employees of the power of the dangerous.
Today, in the area of Ogoni must not firm return: while the daily benefits from the whole area of the delta a triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining and drilling 7,000 kilometres of the leadership of the more than two million barrels of black gold, lie oil fields in the area of the Ogoni fallow, for the concern is the situation of the power of the unstable.
Every a few hundred metres from the water towers steel structures as bizarre statues: 'Christmas stromečky', so it is up to the power of the něžně call the heads of drilling otvorů.
There are 50 years old, most until his zrezivělá.
Every moment, break such head of vrtného otvoru, tells akpobari and then vytéká a constant stream of oil into the water.
According to estimates by experts in the ecosystem in vyteklo deltě more than two billion litres for 50 years: every year, what vyteklo such quantities of oil into the sea in Alaska in accident supertankeru 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
There are disputes, who is responsible for continuing to ongoing ecological disaster.
While concern Shell refers to sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of the pollution, speaks ochranáři environment on the minds of bursting drilling and netěsných vedeních as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires much less safety regulations in the world than is customary, nařkl concern in 2008 us-americký scientist Richard Steiner: only on the quantity of disorders vedeních is supposedly 'several times higher than elsewhere.'
On the ground, which looks from afar as abandoned, oil zašpiněná open-air workshop will emerge from mangrovníků characters: they are completely naked and up to its neck from oil.
Under one of the many casks, which are partly the united leadership, partly arbitrarily roztroušené after the country, fire fire: the illegal small refineries.
Oil in sudu over the fire is heating up a few hours, explains the Michael, the leaders of the groups.
Vyteče ahead of leadership in detention hrnce gasoline later kape at the end of the leadership of the kerosene finally NAFTA.
In this way, produces Michael and its four colleagues on a daily basis until four sudy after 300 litrech: 'We earn so 34.000 naira' - around $22.
The inhabitants of the Delta using a chronic lack of fuel in the largest oil state black Africa.
Nigeria own only one Sucre.
The ridiculously low cost of 40 cents per litre of fuel, the euro can illegal producers even override them: because they are the raw material free of charge.
It comes from the 'bunkerů' who napojují on leadership everywhere in the area of the Ogoni: according to experts in the whole area of the Niger Delta is losing the country on a daily basis, at least 16 million litres of oil.
But only a small part of the provisionally zanedbatelně skladované raw materials are illegally zušlechtí: the largest share fulfils organised criminal networks, to which they belong to, and politicians and senior officials of the army, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether caused the disaster of the people and their interventions or lax way of production, considers the activist akpobari as purely academic.
'if, rather than regarding oil companies for an alien and if so perfectly not destroyed the essence of the fishermen, then it would not even sabotage, nor theft and illegal refineries.'
In the meantime, but it is the relationship of the Ogoni, above all, to shell so poničený that accounts for only consider departure group: 'Perhaps show other nations such as the Chinese as better'.
Michael unsettles the.
'high time to have disappeared, "says svalnatý producers.
'every moment can come soldiers'.
If it is a special military unit, so they may not prison, but the painful bribe.
Also the soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - as all nigeriánci - want to profit from the raw materials.
'tadle prokletá thing received our Earth in all respects the bottom', says akpobari.
Investigators discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines
A380 is obviously of great security concern.
Investigators found in pat-down machines which nouzově přistál, possible construction error, which could lead to the 'disastrous for the shortfall in the engine of the'.
Airline qantas wants to prosecute them producers engines.
Passengers Airbus qantas society should in emergency landing at the beginning of November probably more luck than has so far been known: Australian office for air safety in their inquiries found great security concern on the engines of some machines A380 - and now warns of the possible construction mistake.
Perhaps error should difficult consequences: on one olejovém link might arise because of the cracks opotřebování, said this on Thursday published statements office atsb.
This fact could lead to 'disastrous for the shortfall in the engine of the'.
It is about the engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 aeroplanes of many of the A380.

The Australian airline now take legal action against the British producers turbines.
A recital actions for the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this society.
The head of the society qantas Alan Joyce said that his company will demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire engine parts and has damaged the development of those areas.
Rolls-Royce called cause damage burning oil.
After this event must exchange around the world to 40 engines.
Australian investigators announced that perform additional safety tests with immense aircraft, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The security of the recommendation is the result of cooperation with the Rolls-Royce, spokesman said atsb Martin dolan.
The lack of security was considered sufficiently important to inform all conclusively.
After the emergency landing machines qantas allowed the airline its fleet A380 a few weeks in the country.

The horor suited to artistic kinu?
Režisér Nicolas winding refn trying to overcome the again old borders with its a battle eposem 'walhalla rising'.
On what the audience thought about the Danish režisér Nicolas winding refn when točil 'walhalla rising'?
Captive vikingský fighter with one eye (mads mikkelsen) is free from their torturers and in large kills almost with supernatural force their adversaries - is that, ideally, for young pánské viewers who are seeking the bloody events, because our hero helps bearing the methods of killing and its enemies RVE even vnitřnosti from bellies alive when it is bad mood.
On the other hand, jednooký, as in fact is called, during the entire film says not a word and other characters pronesou most one or two sentences, or to tear down to the painful cries dying people.
Otherwise, the silent and hýří in hrůzně beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which offers the world kulisu vikingů about a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal rather for adults attracting more and more enthusiasts into interested in cinemas existencializmus and very calm images of a camera.
It is good when it is film more target groups, it is only a pity when are mutually exclusive.
Režisér winding refn after natočil its wild and stylizovanou trilogii on drug pusher dealerech ," is regarded as the Danish version of the Director quentina tarantina stoicky, but preventing their works closer to the mainstream humor either more or less brutality artistic audience.
Most of the arts cinemas everywhere will probably deter stříkajícím brain and vnitřnostmi.
Supporters of the action of films, unudí, at the latest, at the moment, when the issue of freely jednooký vysvětlitelných reasons the group of Christian missionaries backwards ships in Jerusalem and still leaves the ages in bezvětří and fog than perhaps dopluje team to America and where further silent.
What, then, is it any wonder that in Germany 'walhalla rising' was not given to the country and has now been published only on DVD.
It is a pity, mainly because of the beautiful záběrům, but also because, for a special façade, at times when zborcenou blood is still burying exciting cinema, which there could be a little attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or precise, everything is atmosphere horečnatý dream, which has become filmem.
And this is not in favour of a spectator at flight.
Refn nedopřeje him nor the moment the mobilisation and slowly it is strangling our mrazivými images and gloomy hypnotickým soundtrackem, but, above all, nepopsatelnou hatred, which prýští from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonďatý boy, which helps jednookému, will retain something like innocence, all the others are poháněni anger.
From all the most jednooký hero, whose motives never nevysvětlí, which will be the time for enemies and transitional allies válečníkem from hell, perhaps envoy of the devil.
It plays the devastation, but perhaps also only for those develop rotten.
'walhalla rising' is a shadowy film, which it is possible to hate and admire, angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious natural work
The Office for nuclear energy, the IAEA has new warnings on secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But prevents expression - and nor will control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 similar ideas at least four Israeli combat airplanes F-15 even over čtvercovou building in Syria.
It is on the Bank euphratu; the earliest greater city is distant 30 kilometres and appoint the dair as-saur.
In the documents of the International Office for nuclear energy (IAEA) appears its name, when it comes to the reactor, which allegedly by Syria with North Korea in this čtverci schovaném in the valley, which odbočuje from the mainstream.
On the basis of the communication us-americké foreign secret services of the CIA from the end of April 2008 the reactor, also known under the name of the near villages el-kibar, well, on the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s on nothing else a statesman.
The CIA video presented with nezaostřenými satellite images.
With the help of computer animace clarify where which components of the reactor before the destruction of could be, is to act on zmenšenou a copy of the North Korean model Yongbyon nuclear centre.
Moreover, were even tabled photographs which show building closely or even from within.
The reactor was supposedly shortly before the launch of the, but even without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, knows much more than then, even with the conundrum time even decreased.
Earlier us-prezident George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA has been before the attack a lot of certain that Syria is building in el-kibar reactor, but essentially not groundwork that in the country is' active a nuclear weapons programme '.
Some of the rapporteurs of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about 'alleged reactor', even though the presentation of the CIA are considered 'ECHO'.
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
On the issue of how is sure that has a reactor reply in the summer of high diplomat UN, the IAEA has supposedly 'sufficient material to place the issue of'.
Rubble supposedly 'unused military buildings' was syřany while quickly odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Nevertheless, we have managed to find in June 2008, the IAEA team under the leadership of the former chief inspector Olli heinonen in el-kibar traces of uranium, which was produced human beings.
In addition, the IAEA has received over Member State satellite photographs of commercial outlets from the period immediately after the attack, which should be better than those that presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are on the market, because it is bought exclusively friendly unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that should never secret nuclear programme and not avoid the reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, to express with Damascus.
But this has been disproved by the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss the matter - as well as on the satellite záběrech.
In addition, banned revizorům second inspection in el-kibar and access to post-Cold rozbombardované buildings.
But also Israel remains utterly silent.
'We never comment on the' official position was confirmed recently at the time of the ruling Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
Investigation of the case so stretches fruitless from June 2008 and 'is growing into a serious problem owing to the credibility of the office', as acknowledged high Western diplomat in the seat of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, it is a serious breach of the Treaty on the ban on nuclear weapons, which monitors the IAEA.
The IAEA considered key to moving in the matter of the other three facilities, which are to be 'in the parliamentary links' with the alleged reaktorem - and, unlike him even exist.
At the same time, did not cite revizoři so far, neither of which facilities, or what they function or why are suspicious.
According to information from the newspapers Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as marj as-sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah deducted, again according to the near cities.
An independent institute for science and international security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects, and found on satellite snapshots complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspects objects.
Probably located within or in the immediate vicinity of military bases - it is precisely for this reason that refuses to Syria IAEA access to these three points.
In Vienna, said that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that would be sent to the US, the IAEA in advance vypátral military bases.
Jaderní detektivové facilities have been alerted to the US secret service.
The IAEA has the groundwork and also satellite images that between these three places and čtvercem for euphratu transportoval material here and there.
In Vienna said high Western diplomat, that at least one furnished should be 'in connection with the fuel production'.
There are no but 'no evidence of senzibilních activities', i.e. to the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by May, which is enriched uranium.
But where the uranium comes from and where it should later split plutonium to bomb, to these central issues there are only likely estimates.
It is also well known, whether the wreckage of which could conceal the important clues, are shelved on these three places.
Though disappeared from the surface of the earth's hundreds of costs of freight wagons, no one does not seem to have information, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el-kibar distant and, on the other hand, euphratu lying salt mine al-tibni Syria, which has allowed itself to be checked in 1998 as suitable for the storage of radioactive waste, considers the IAEA as unlikely.
The IAEA inspector Robert kelley it made in connection with the reaktorem in one analysis of satellite images for renomovaný magazine Jan 'with intelligence review.
Images from space but show that, after the IAEA demanded approach, carried out by Syria at all suspects places natural work and remove the great kontejnery.
It could be a coincidence, but it does not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, speaks diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months the formation of plan for revizory, which would allow the Syria to preserve the potential military secrets - only the hardship shows how great is the interest revizorů.
In the meantime, Syria has rejected this proposal.
If even a year ago uklidňovali Western diplomats in Vienna, that is after all the destroyed reactor, and therefore thing nehoří, speaks for several months, US Ambassador Glyn Davies about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the harsher the funds, which has vídeňský nuclear office on the reinforcement of controls.
The head of the IAEA yukiya Amano, which would have had to propose inspections, has already talked about 'possibilities to agree in the future', but it is.
This choice offers great risk: on the one hand, to the need for the majority in the Council the IAEA guvernérské and many from represented 35 countries certainly does not have an interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as it highlights one diplomat: 'what will happen if, in the end, nothing cannot find?'
Love in times of war
Since then, what Angelina Jolie started in the summer work on still anonymous overheads prvotině, difficulties have arisen.
Itself wrote scenario, it is about love story from Bosnia women and men from Serbia.
Much more is not yet know - but it also causes anxiety.
Consistently spoken about the fact that one woman, which is a Muslim, zamiluje during the war in Yugoslavia in the Serbian men, which it znásilnil.
The Bosnian female alliances immediately protested, so quickly shifted planned natáčení from Sarajevo in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary dotočil and is in postprodukci in bosensku, but still objects.
Bakira hasecic from the female war victims wrote despite un-organizace to help refugees from the UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the herečkou, now informed the Bosnian newspapers - is also Jolie velvyslankyní un-organizace to help the refugees.
It is not just the diplomatic - has offered to women before the weeks meeting in Hungary, which but refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said hasecic.
In kempech where znásilňovalo, milostné stories have been held there, and the attitude towards the victims of the reveals Jolie enough about the scenario.
Its Organisation therefore recommend un-organizaci to help refugees to release Jolie as velvyslankyni, inform the guardian.
What exactly has written to the scene Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received to read her scenario, permitted for smaller tug-of-war in Sarajevo natáčení - it is not entirely clear, why then Jolie nepřijela yet.
The young author emphasises that in his movie does not consider any political intentions, that with a great deal of effort to draw the conflict in Yugoslavia, that it wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and all of the parties involved to give room.
In view of the content of remains vague.
On the Internet are even one version of the film, which is really quite otherwise: boyfriends, they knew already before the war and again potkají when it is she as Bosnia's Muslim zavlečená into the Serbian kempu, where he serves as a guardian of the.
That really is enough other than 'victim of rape zamiluje into its mučitele'.
The fact that the film Jolie really is already before the war - it is true.
Jolie notes that it is to exert pressure, which 'is not fair and based on the erroneous information'.
Now it can release is already hekeři from Hollywood: by illegally on the Internet will publish its scenario, as many have already done.

Since the poll held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole of the area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and at the beginning of October, dominated by two related issues.
The first of these is that Latin America is quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The promotion of democracy in a number of countries on the fringes of the Pacific in South America has grown significantly (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where, since 2002, economic growth averaged 6% per year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
We also have increased in Mexico, where economics zotavovala after a deep downturn production in the last year.
But only around half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas are the convictions of Democrats, which is withdrawing the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of the respondents across the whole of the areas, satisfaction as in their country democracy works in practice, it is about the same figure as last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was a 25%, it is a huge increase in the graph (3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted the Bundestag in their country and 45% trust the government, and, once again, it is about the same figures as last year, but it is a big difference in comparison with the year 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, undermining democracy in Latin America the economic crisis.
The promotion of arose during the global financial crisis, probably for this reason that many Latin American countries suffered and was only a brief recession with strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger the network of social security has helped to protect poor people.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased in 2009 only slightly and in this year once again fell to 32%).
But the mood changes in a wide range of from country to country (see graph 4).
Strong economic performance of Brazil and popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva, is reflected in the widely přijímaném sense for progress.
This situation is scarce in Mexico and Central America, where there was serious, and the recession has worsened the state of violent crime.
Only the second time since the surveys, began to see more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
Roughly 31% says that either they or their close relatives in the last year have become the victims of crime, but it is the decline in comparison with the figure 38% of last year and it is also the lowest number since 1995.
Masivnější economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% across the whole area of says that private entrepreneurship is necessary for the development of, this percentage has risen from 56% of the year 2007 (see graph 6).
Some 58% agrees that the market economy is the only system that will enable the development of their countries, this percentage has risen from 47% of last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion (and 80% there supports private business), even though their left-wing President Hugo Chávez vyvlastňuje many private companies.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the field, as mentioned by 19% of the respondents (compared to 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year the year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% in the last year)
However, the United States are regarded as the most influential country respondents in Mexico and in large parts of Central America, and Venezuela enjoy success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised elections
No one would have expected that the general elections on Haiti on 28 November perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders, who has tried to help the affected country to afraid.
The elections marked a box and the recurring vote, the voting papers rozmetané after channels, rozbité polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many of the Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, potulovalo around and trying to find out where they can go to the vote.
Some of them this eventually given up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several envisaged předběžců screaming that this is about fraud and called for the abolition of the elections.
Protests, some of them violent nature, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, has said that 'in many respects was quite good elections'.
Observers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that 'believes that these irregularities, whether they were serious, though not necessarily to abolish the process'.
In other words, show continues.
The electoral body, whose voices are obliged René prévalovi nepopulárnímu, the outgoing President and his candidate jude célestinovi has to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two prominent opposition candidates Michel martelly, raper and mirlande manigat, a former first lady, withdrawal from its original challenges in order to vote were declared null and void.
But the problem can occur if Mr célestin, which has little or little support among the voters will be labelled Election Commission for that has reached a decisive contest.
For the sake of řádící cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people who, after the earthquake still living in tents, there were fears that turnout will be low.
Finally, many of the Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the dezorganizace them has been averted.
Approximately 250 thousand passport identity, which are necessary for the vote remained nerozdělené shortly before the elections.
What is at stake is a lot.
Donors see the choice of the legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear, therefore, that this will place the Haitians themselves.
Around to the center
In the weeks when suddenly ovdověla, benefit Cristina Fernández, Argentina's President, from public sympathy, when its popularity has strengthened from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since, when it was in 2007 elected.
Yet the conversion of this success in a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections can depend on whether truchlící Mrs fernándezová give up rigorous their deceased husband predecessor and political partner néstora kirchnera.
And on these factors, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, which continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, should in the habit of budgeting, which downgrading tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has allowed the first couple spend another incomes as it pleases.
The government of Mrs fernándezové lost in the last year of the majority in Congress.
But the opposition was divided and was further destabilised in the death of Mr kirchnera heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the reigning political movement Peronist to join Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (on which there has been a facial and blaming the government of corruption), Congress has failed to approve the budget for 2011.
'I am not going to argue,' said the President.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, with President will have more room spend as it pleases.
The economy is overheating excessively: this is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now fetching 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists talks about the number, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, which took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by a string economic collapse, set the priority on growth and the reduction of poverty, rather than on the control of inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, the private sector and cleanse zatěžoval indec, statistical agency, which has started on the monitoring of the official inflation statistics.
Can now President fernándezová moderate this policy?
Called for negotiations between private enterprise and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want in the next year to limit the growth of wages at 18%.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation undermining growth based on the great devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs President fernándezová gives to know that it wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with the holders of the bonds, who previously rejected debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001 nezaplatila.
Now faces the Madam President fernándezová agreement with the creditor governments, which are united in the Paris Club, which owes roughly 6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not on the supervision of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month boudou Amado, Minister for the economy, announced that the Fund will provide 'technical assistance' that was proposed by the new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which will remind the introduction to cleaning indec.
It is not yet clear whether Madam President fernándezová will want to remain in the policy after the end of the term of office, if the husband is not after its side.
If we want to remain, needs to gain the support of the middle class, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer holidays, which have in March, it will be a wave of sympathy decline.
If we want to win the next election, it will have to decide whether it will not be quietly to waive the many views that her husband in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanští voters are užšímu closer links with the mainland.
What Taiwan thinks about its big brother across the sea?
More than EUR 7.5 m, 70% of eligible voters voted, on 27 November mayor of the city and the Council in five urban constituencies, which may be considered a broader evaluation under President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr President Ma itself is a representative of feeling, which is dominated by land and have a strong commitment in business relations, including the agreement on free trade, in the largest part of the settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr President Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his party the Kuomintang (KMT) ended achievement of three of the five authorities mayors, failed to win a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence in Taiwan won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it is a presidential elections, should President Ma difficulties.
Since it was elected two years ago, the share of the votes of his party, has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time, a party of the DPP, together with the KMT in urban Councils.
The elections took place as most taiwanských elections, which include hlučné electoral trucks and mass Assembly with vlaječkami is poorly oděnými girls.
Part of his was even mandatory an assassination attempt.
Sean LIEN, the son of a LIEN chana, honest President of the KMT was agitate for candidates KMT on the eve of the elections.
A crowd of a young man from Mr LIEN purely through face, zranil him and killed spectator at.
Bizarně has not been determined whether should ozbrojenec intend to hurt by Mr liena or settle dispute with candidate.
In any case, tsai ing-wen, leading the DPP, claiming that the shooting influenced elections, suspicions raining down on the DPP and voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner campaign was China.
It was a remarkable, as have remained in the background to the issue of the land.
Instead, the candidates zápolili about the plans to state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually uses its de facto independence and hate military threats of China.
The KMT has therefore tend to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also refrain from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
It is a response to a reality and to the realisation that China's trade is of crucial importance for the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr President Ma for his hand, confirmed that China's policy is for the majority of Taiwan acceptable.
From the government in Beijing, we might expect that it will continue to commercial best, together with its strategies to Taiwan nalákal back into the fold.
China neztrácela time in sending the negotiators to taipeje to arrange the summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Certainly, I would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the party of the DPP was itself.
Two years ago, was at the wrong level: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The President was in 2000-08 buřič and supporter of clear independence.
But, under the leadership of Mrs tsai developed the new generation, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard on this, to attract the experts and young people.
Mrs tsai was provolávána as a list of the DPP president, such as, for example, Suu tseng-changem, which held the office under Mr chenem.
Their party now is doing everything to has shown that can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without the prior conditions.
Mrs tsai taiwanské tells the public that her party represents a 'a credible alternative' for a hurried approach Mr Ma to China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry this drift.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the candidates for the DPP would have done better, if insisted that Taiwan is a separate countries.
Even ordered Mr Suu, pragmatikovi not to stand for President.
But even without the intervention of Mr chena DPP will fight on the choice between a potential candidates.
The KMT is justified to search their own people.
The evaluation of Mr Ma were bad, and despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates with it did not want to go into the campaign.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on the unemployment and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The spokesman of the KMT says that přeorganizuje its government, as well as local offices.
Strongly promoted by the proposals to support Taiwan for a rapprochement are limited.
At the same time it considers most taiwanských citizens economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio chianga, immigrant publicisty 'point, from which there is no return, has already passed.'

Microbes with arsenic resistance to increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of the strange bacteria, which can use include arsenic as one of their nutrients, extends the scope for finding new forms of life on earth, and perhaps even further.
Researchers find an unusual bacterium from here on the country and says that this is a sign that life has opportunities, which is outside the main elements that have been seen and fundamental.
'This organism is double the ability of'.
'May growth, either because of phosphorus or arsenic.'
'This fact is very special, but this is proof that it is a form of really' mimozemského 'life' comment on this fact Paul C. W. Davies from of Arizona State University, a co-author of a report which appeared in the Thursday in online edition of science.
For a long time been considered necessary for the lives of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and síra.
However, scientists have found that bacteria, discovered in mono lake in California, are able to continue in growth after for include arsenic replace phosphorus.
'you begin to wonder what is still possible, "said Ariel D. Anbar from of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This judgement is significant for the search for life outside the country, because researchers must be able to identify the life and know how life can look like Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found in the country.
However, the report on this novince published that have been discussed, which find neprozrazovala details, provoking a wide speculation on the Internet, that the report reveals the discovery mimozemského life.
It is not the case.
The discovery 'shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that fuel biochemistry and that a series of elements which we consider' standard ', may not be for life as absolutely necessary' to explain Charles cockell, a professor at planetary sciences and space research institute, open university, Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
'This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element of the element of the other in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure' add cockell.
It was not a random judgement.
Felisa wolfe-simon from astrobiologického Institute in NASA, which led to the study, focused on mono lake, since it has a high level of arsenic.
Include arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements thought, therefore, that sustaining themselves, which is subject to the two elements can be able to replace one for the second.
'include arsenic is poisonous, mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar phosphorus.'
'The result is that it is very hard to organisms can these elements separated.'
', however, include arsenic is so different that, as well as the phosphorus is not working. When it gets to the organism, begin its work in the biochemical processes' Anbar explained.
Scientists have pooled bacteria known as gfaj-1 and increasing arsenic concentration, which are bacteria able to adapt to and growth.
Microbes are better in the operation of phosphorus, but given that can survive also with a substitute arzenem, increases the possibility that the form of life, which uses include arsenic, can arise naturally, and that either elsewhere in the country or on another planet or months ago, where it is include arsenic more normal.
Jamie S. foster, technical assistant mikrobiologie at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by fosforem, is not new, but never found, for example, on which this fact was achieved.
Include arsenic was common in earlier times on the country, has said, and so the scientists speculated that it could use of earlier forms of life.
'This suggests that could be other ways to create life, not only in a way which will be created in the early period of countries' foster said, which was not part of the research team wolfe-simona.
Research was supported by organisations NASA, the Ministry of energy and the National Institute of Health

The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
The MGM nevynoří suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan chase agreed on the planned financial resources enabling a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and the production of MGM.
It is now a link with the investment bank, which itself needs 75 million dollars and the financing of the expected around half of the December.
The study of the restructuring process started in May 2009, when it was najata investment bank moelis & Co., been able to manage to management, how to resolve their finances, as part of the management of the fight to ensure that we can afford to interest payments of EUR 300 million dollars per year.

Attempts to solve the financial difficulties moelise and coopera MGM and 140 creditors studies have taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions with the parties agreed that, at the end of the year 2009 will society to sell.

Technological toys, which will maintain your budget for gifts in the balance
The leading candidate this year is the most exciting toy iPad, would for which follows videoherní system. In both cases, however, is a major intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one ipadu you can buy five rounds of bmx for 99 dollars and one game kinect costs as well as 10 korálkových švihadel or around 48 kelímků play-doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in the balance.
I recently visited three national toys - the retailer Wal-Mart, toys' r 'us and bj' with the wholesale club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that works mooreův law; this year's technological toys have a far more energy, and this in the same prices, if not a little lower in comparison with the past years.
While there have been relatively fewer new toys with its affiliated Web sites, the two most famous toys of this type, webkinz and club Penguin, offers more.
Increasing the number of toys with knoflíkovými batteries, as well as the toys with batteries nabíjecími.
Here are some of the recommendations.
(all these prices are from toys' r 'us, except in cases which are demarcated otherwise).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13, from $3 years) are soft toys that which singing when they stisknete bříško.
In one stisknutí zvířátko tone and the second will hold will create song.
If koupíte more than one will be singing together and harmoniously.
A warning: once you start mačkat, you cannot stop.
The best option in the combination of zpěvu and dancing is dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60, from $2 years)

More than one government tried to revive the image of urban dozorců in China.
One city ordered to new branci should university education.
Guangdong province has changed šedo-zelené uniforms to supposedly attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China has replaced upřené views for the strong equipment: in 2009 was in one report stated that 50 officers were surrounded by firmly wheelchair ramp, svačinami and hard to owners looked up podomní seller after a half hour sbalil and hit.
Xindu, urban districts with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu in the main the image of the elected operation.
Since 2003, districts added its urban police on the 13 of women who were chosen specifically according to its appearance, souměrnosti and a young age.
The aim is to show in addition to gross pages of the police also subtler, female party.
Unfortunately, even the very scarlett johansson should difficulties to get into the secret of Chinese urban groups.
Critics would have argued for good reason.
Unlike the police, it is these police officers allowed only promote urban vyhlášku, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media normally draw a different reality.
In January 2008 the police inspectors from Hubei province utloukli nezúčastněného spectator at to death after used their phone to natáčení, both on in the intervention in the matter of protest against the dustbin.
In the last year, police training in Beijing, the guide to this training was being hijacked and placed on the Internet. In manuálu was, among other things, the description of how effectively zmlátit perpetrators without the signs of blood.
This year came podomní obchodník with melouny in Shanghai in brawls with five policeman and suffered injuries left parts of the brain.
One videohra full of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows the Chinese police officers as attacks on the street retailers.
'chengguan terrorized government' China Daily, national edition naříkala last year after a further discussion on the tactics.
On paper cost 'really thorough cleaning up'.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district inzeroval in October interest on the eight new female policistek, the editorial in the Beijing evening news has dealt with the issue of whether women have real obligations or are only withdrawing.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
District called for female uchazečky aged 18 to 22 years with good figure and 'five features faces in the right proporci.'
Adeptky should be setting higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 metres.
Výslužba in the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials argue that work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years.
'their image is an important point, "said one nejmenovaný police officer on rednet.com though government website.
'candidate must first show external quality, which then determine further among them, the weight of premiums, features faces, etc.'
Then comes the nature and quality 'internal'.
Women are as květinové vázy said and add 'in addition, that will be vázami, they will also have other responsibilities'.
Zheng lihua, deputy director of the leadership of the county town, with this description of the power.
But point out that the requirements for setting in China are normal also for other jobs and for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for balanced features faces.
Which means that the issue of the good image is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilated certainly neuplatní.
'cannot be allowed to serve in the US chromý or hrbatý man,' said Mr Zheng.
'his image would not be a good'.
Liu Yi, which holds patrol Tiananmen baoguang in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces as jablíčka and gently tvarovaná mouth.

With its mere co-operators dolíčkama, 21-letá Xu Yang says' it is our task to represent the image of the cities'.
Do not object to its limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely zahánět traders to uliček where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning is group against more than ten trhovcům who pobíhají on foot or rounds and trying to sell what most knedlíčků and misek tofu before they are thrown out.
'Mr wangu, you must leave.'
'We have heard you say very much!' say miss Xu when he began trhovec run, and in the time left their round with vozíkem with nudlemi.
The police describe their obligations as more monotónní than painful.
'every day, it is essentially the same,' said Huang Jing, 20, which are studying in their vacations marketing.
The 'great routine.'
One of the reasons is that of female policistky do not have powers as their male counterparts, so that they can take goods sellers.
Can only threaten the fact that they expose their male heads.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public expressions of hostility against úřednímu apparatus, which are common in the framework of the whole of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunmingu, the capital Yunnan province, revolt of having spread false rumours that policisti were killed by the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the small hours of the night; 14 government vehicles to be převráceno or zapáleno.

As well as the female policistky, coordinators are men over 40 years, who already have only an instrumental role.
Unlike them are not learned in the maintenance and uhlazování image.
'We are sometimes verbally.'
'We are sometimes physically,' said Mr Li calmly.
'The majority of it is public, which starts with'.
Prosecutors will not blame Senator ensigna
Prosecutors Ministry of Justice redeem Senator John ensigna from criminal charges on his affair with the former consultant for campaign and his efforts to ensure the lobby, announced on Wednesday senátorovi lawyers.
The decision to end the most serious legal threat, which Mr Ensign, nevadský a Republican, faced and which was, until the scandal, considered the possible Republican candidate for President for 2012. His affair into national headline and damaged his career.
The office of Mr ensigna said that was decisions that followed for almost an annual investigation 'certainly pleased with the'.
Senator could still face disciplinary proceedings for ethical Commission Senate.
The lawyers Mr ensigna said that the Ministry of Justice 'informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the aim of the investigation and that it is not in the plan to raise another charge against him in this matter'.
The Ministry of Justice, on the case of refused to comment.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there are serious evidence that Mr Ensign was breaches of the ban on the federal lobbying.
The talks, e-mails and other documents, which were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr Ensign helped douglasu hamptonovi, one of my assistants, to ensure the lucrative lobby, which should lead to silence Mr hamptona and his wife, is about senátorově contract with it.
Mrs hamptonová once worked as pokladník ensigna in the campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted many political supporters, to find work for Mr hamptona and supported their views, after Mr hamptona recruited for them, so they lobbied documents and talks.
As was Hampton recently asistentem Mr ensigna was from the law of lobbying its former employer or the Senate in the year excluded.
Experts on ethics argue that unusual addressing Mr ensigna and Mr hamptona who were the biggest friends, occurred in violation of the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence, which were published ', it became clear that it is a clear case of preparation of the violation of the law,' said Stanley brand, Washington lawyer who specializes in defence of the clients, who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator ensigna, Mr brand and other lawyers, specialization on ethics have said that the Ministry is cautious as regards the political actions, after a number of setbacks, including the decision of last year to suspend proceedings against the former senátorovi tedu stevensovi in the middle of the allegations of misconduct State representations.
The federal prosecutors' clearly schovali weapons', said Melanie sloan, Executive Director of the citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington (citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington), advocacy group, which tabled in the matter of several complaints against Mr ensignovi.
'this shows in fact on that at the high-level government officials laws, add'.
Paul coggins, the lawyer Mr ensigna, in an interview, told him that on Monday called the public prosecutor at the Ministry of Justice and, consequently, then the second day, and say to him that the Ministry of neshledalo against his clients no charges.
Mr ensigna obhajovací team is working with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that senator, as his office to reiterate in Wednesday's statement, 'acted in accordance with the law.'
Mr coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments, which convey government representatives.
'I am not pleasant the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice in addition that we think that made the right decision,' he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of separate complaints in which ethical group gives the accusations that the payment of parents ensigna hamptonům, to the tune of $96,000 broke the federal electoral law.
The election of the Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money would break anything other than a gift.
One company, for which Mr Ensign helped Mr hamptonovi find lobbying work was firm NV energy, the main nevadská society, which long Senator supported.
One an e-mail from December 2008 has shown that, after Mr Hampton in society began to act as a lobbyist, leading employees Mr ensigna - John Lopez - interact with Mr hamptonem and say to him that 'bušil' into the Ministry of the Interior on the subject matter under discussion.
Mr Ensign, also took part in their lunch with Mr hamptonem and other nevadským klientem, allegiant air and call on the Minister of Transport, to the meeting he had finished speaking on behalf of the airlines, after Mr hamptona najmou on lobbying work.
When last year, for the first time a report on the affair, Mr Ensign apologise to the electorate and resigned on its function, as in the order of the fourth Republican leading in the Senate.
After many months' stagnation Mr Ensign two weeks ago told reporters that it intends to participate in the third term in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer objective investigation of crime Jennifer Cooper his spokesman said that Senator hopes that ethical the Commission will quickly followed by the Ministry of Justice and will put an end to the whole of the investigation.
'Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing in their hard work in the name of nevadského people,' said further.
The challenge of municipalities Cheshire turns on Twitter
In the ranks of the courts have half a dozen written.
One minute by minute sending reports on the horrendous testimonies via Twitter.
Finally, the defence of the says that more than 140 000 reports on Twitter handled by acts of rape and přivazováním children to postelím in the House, which was zapálen.
On Thursday, the trials held Steven J. hayese, who was sentenced for the killing of three citizens Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and should take place with the strongest official put an end to the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But the lawyers Mr hayese already tabled an appeal with the Court's demands and arguments that the Court would probably employed years.
One of the nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter major press corps - to create a 'cirkusovou atmosphere' and this widespread immediate infiltrate information with inflammatory details then porotu erected in the decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This could make a judge to address the issue of whether, with the arrival of the new technologies do not demand also new rules in the Court.
'as I experienced this trials, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual,' said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr hayese.
The judge of the process Jon C. blue chief Court refused to state briefly the claims concerning the yield from last week and with the fact that the media were 'carefully controlled', and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury act under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
After decades of the courts recognized that news notorious known cases can trigger questions about justice process.
In the Court of the regulations from 1966 the Supreme Court of the United States abolished condemnation clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr shepparda itself for the murder of his wife when, in its decision, said that in the case of sheppard versus Maxwell, is in the process of reason, the media was a 'karnevalovou atmosphere'.
Some are convinced that this criminal offence was an inspiration television show and film 'refugee'.
Some lawyers said that appeals to the courts, which review hayesův judgment on half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that could be the necessary new rules, which determine the way communication from the judicial síní, which was in the case of Dr sheppard unimaginable.
'There is general reason for concern about the impact of the new media' in a highly sought cases said John J. donohue III, a professor of law Stanford law school, who has studied the death penalty in connecticutu and wrote a report which said that it was exercised at random.
Professor donohue said that some judges can be pleased with the idea that the restrictions on the immediate communication from the judicial síní can make the process of fairer.
The case of Twitter is only one of many outlined by Mr hayese lawyers, who would be able to argue for years, to desist from row.
Defenders of, for example, also argue that, in the case of Mr hayese can go about bias, when the judge blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of the potential porotců by them in the choice of poroty shows photographs of criminal nahánějící horror.
Some of the porotců said that were horrified at the pictures of the victims, which has become Jennifer hawke-petit, 48, and her daughters hayley, 17 and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also will reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, and says that the judge wrongly dismissed porotce, which was critical of the government representatives, and that the decision he used incorrectly greater pressure on the verdict and směroval porotu to think the weekend.
The judges were decoupled.
But their arguments on the impact of the scale of the process can attract the greatest interest.
Put in the reserve against the verdict vzneseném last month, that the case of bestrode the reports in connecticutu and has been discussed during the election campaign and the Governor of the candidates for the Senate of the United States.
Argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly the flames of emotions in this case.
'daily bout of the media, cameras and reporters before a court of law, "wrote the lawyer' was something here in the new havenu has still not been to see, and it is perhaps also on national raritu. '
Their focus on the interaction of Twitter is controversial.
In the talks some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than this report later and from their point of view should judicial police to manage the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers demanded appeal courts with often used arguments, that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
The lawyers Mr hayese seek this right.
In their archives, referred to the Supreme Court decision from 1966 judgment in the case of Dr shepparda, due to the scale of the operation of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
'this case, "wrote,' represents a case sheppard versus Maxwell 21st century. '
Can courtesy to overcome the gap?
Following the campaign which was remarkable its urážlivostí and negativismem, this week in Washington, there are a small number of courtesy.
This is a good sign of genuine cooperation between the two political parties, or only iluzivní moment a rapid return to the party's fight in the town of?
Úterní negotiations of President Obama and parliamentary leadership has not brought any major discoveries on the crucial issues which must be dealt with during the sitting.
In any case, but it was a civilised discussion regarding the differences of views of the two parties, as well as defining their joint responsibility, rather than the other empty episode of party-political wrangling.
Wednesday public sitting President Jiang's deficit, the Commission was also a civilized, and despite the political differences between members of the remain.
It seems that it is clear that the close collaboration over a period of several months to build mutual respect, which transcends ideological divide that Members still divides.
And it is quite difficult to say that at the start of a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the early period - sondují other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the borders of public opinion and the electoral patience towards a renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also úterní negotiations and its subsequent evaluation of the participants, carried out with the minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that are there over the last two years.
Whether it is a question of taxes, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections has prepared a Washington at least quickly.
', it is not a question of whether we have changed the regulatory matters, "said pete wehner, Bush's this now in ethics and public policy centres.
'They are after the elections the inevitable.
Elections to pump up the party faithful emotions and they then utichli.
This is a good '.
In the few issues, especially those that are to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding solutions.
Bush's tax cut would expire at the end of the year, and no one considers favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, and this permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans cannot look at how supported the tax cuts for the rich, while refusing to support the unemployed in unemployment.
After úterním negotiations in the White House is already see greater optimism about the possible agreement on these issues, together with the opening of the ratification of the new Treaty.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institution highlights that the successful cooperation on the fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between two political parties, when 112. Congress has called on January.
Rather, it is the likely period disagreements, or even inevitable, said.
'then, as do the things that must be done in the short term, psychology return to one of the confrontations,' told.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is largely widespread - to lead that civility is real cooperation.
'I am looking at all events between now and the year 2012 as the shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012,' he said.
The reasons for the largely relates to developing new Republican majority in the White House and voters čajových parties who helped draft it.
Republican leaders now faces the danger of exaggeration, know that must behave according to their promises and must reduce spending governments and to abolish the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké line are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include reform of the tax code and increase certain taxes, an increase in the retirement age and spending cuts.
Common Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in my opinion, the issue of the deficit to exert pressure on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18-ti členné Commission to its plan to present as official recommendations and fought, therefore, that this figure as possible.
The greatest resistance is between the elected officials in being who proposed that, in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of a party conflicts, when Obama Republicans will call for the solution of the budget, taxes and health care, to be followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What can shift?
Public opinion.
There are a lot of evidence that, despite the partisanship during the last elections, most Americans wants to continue to see the two parties that are working together.
If we could move towards stalemate, as was the case in 1995, then both sides will be very carefully monitor the public reaction.
Anyone would risk reduction of votes, is likely to change course and will seek a compromise.
This may be an optimistic view on the matter.
Partisanship of and guidelines are today more than has been the case in the middle of the 1990s, and it turns out that has created more ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than has been the case in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time activists on both sides see 2010 as the prelude to the important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the courtesy which this week there, would have liked to see many Americans.
This will be the state but many efforts on both sides, in order to find common ground on issues which is still divide.
Vyzrazený American document describes Moscow as a refuge corruption
The management of cities is in the hands of the 'kleptokracie' and it continues parts of the bribes and bribes for protection, which are the way to kremlinu, give us embassy in Russia in the records in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service in large measure holds protective wings, which help to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from the legal trade but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called 'vertikála office' - take their money when they move after the ladder up.
The record, which was sent to Washington, under the name of ambasadora John beyrleho, was at the centre of the published by WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on resources, whose names have been redigována.
The record was written in a time when he was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses it of a large share of corruption.
It was lifted in October President Dmitry medvedevem but, since we can see only minimal changes in očistě.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena baturina which own prominent construction company, after many years of constantly about allegations of corruption, and won a few actions for křivé charges for such accusations.
In September, said at the Russian television station, when he was asked to shown evidence of corruption: 'It is crazy, it is špína, it is svinstvo.'
The Russians with absolute conviction believes that if it is their society corrupt, that will become apparent in the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details vyřčenými in such a way, and that in ambasádní report, and it is also an unprecedented that it would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
'the Government of the city of Moscow and its links with the criminal elements some have led to question it' dysfunctional, 'and confirm that the government of works, as more than a government,' says the report.
'criminal elements are from the so-called' krysha ' (the term from the world of prison and the mafia, which literally means' roof 'or the protection of), which gives them the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
'analysts identified and třístupňovou structure in the criminal world Moscow.'
'Luzhkov is at the very top.'
'the Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second stage of'.
'and, lastly, the lowest level of are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors'.
'It is ineffective system in which criminal groups are filling the empty jobs in some areas, because the city of some services.'
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest companies and police focuses on smaller businesses.
One source of said, 'owners shops in Moscow recognize that it is better to get the protection from the FSB or of the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organised criminal groups), since not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law'.
'for this reason for protection from the criminal gangs is not so in the rate'.
The record says that while the selection of money is comprehensive, protecting itself may have difficulties; even those what is true, can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly enough, their shops closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has admitted that he is only a small step forward.
The report talks about men ambasádní beroucích bags, probably napěchovanými cash, governments in the kremlinu.
'in its fight against corruption must be Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats, "said in a recent interview Georgy satarov, the director of the Moscow research team indem.
'but it is part of this bureaucracy'.
'It is not part of the political class, because in Russia has the political class, there are no'.
Without the politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, said.
Indem estimates that corruption is nationwide Russia more than $300 billion per year.
Countries are on the 154. rather than in a recent survey on the global corruption perceptions transparency international non-governmental organisations (countries are ordered from at least after the most corrupt).
The discovery of the report of the US embassies in Moscow appeared until late in the day for the Russian Government certainly did not provoke the enthusiasm, although only to the extent that for Moscow's shortcomings can be accused of Luzhkov, it may be able to argue for the Kremlin, as in the matter of the solution to the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry kingem Putin told us that the documents that published the WikiLeaks could be counterfeit and respond rozzlobeně on the statement that American diplomats call Batman and medvedeva Robin.
'the truth about the whole matter is that it is about our mutual collaboration, which is an important factor in the domestic policy in this country,' he said.
'But, to be honest, nedomnívali we have is that it will be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, do you understand, so neeticky.'
Veterans of the Khmer khmérů are forced to come to terms with the past
In the poorly osvětlené concrete učebně zašpiněnými oloupanými walls, and remind you of the Director of the schools anlong veng high school men, which it has built, the leaders of the Khmer Rouge the Mok.
'all here love the moka.'
'was a good leader and ensuring their people, "said sreng KOR Ma, 42.
What is known as' a butcher 'for their during the vileness of the governments of the Khmer Rouge, remains the commander in this remote državě the Khmer Rouge in the north-west of Cambodia popular, where has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where there are still thousands of former soldiers of this organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge their government is nabouraná prolonged loyalty also in anlong vengu.
In April was the victims in the forum of the truth and reconciliation allowed to publicly to confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government has provided textbooks, which for the first time children explain history of the Khmer Rouge, and their former soldiers.
And in July to raise together, the United Nations and Cambodia's Court first condemnation of the former Member of the Khmer Rouge, overturning the judgment of the former leader of the notorious thuggish associations Tuol Sleng, Kaing khek iev, známějšího as spirit to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress had been increasing unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in anlong veng, which complicates the efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to engage again in the Cambodian society.
'between the former Khmer Rouge is resentment and fear, but they are powerless to do anything, "said chhang youk, leading documentation centres of Cambodia, independent organisations, which examines the regime.
'for them, life between the Khmer Rouge marvellous, but the regime has become a symbol of the evil'.
It divides' family '.
During the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, since 1975, in 1979, was an estimated 1.7 million people will have died of starvation or executed on disease or recast.
When the Vietnamese assaulted and overthrow the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Start uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary followed of guerrilla warfare of their bases in the mountains and jungles in Western Cambodia, while the Mok kultivoval supporters in anlong vengu.
But in the middle of the 1990s, following the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was held for the first democratic elections in 1993. Large group of the fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to switch to the government, which culminated in the kapitulací Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and the Mok who stayed, was in 1999 he was kidnapped by government forces in nedalých dangrek mountains.
He died in Phnom penhském prison in 2006 during the waiting on the process.
Their patrons already nepečovali about them, most of the former combatants Khmer Rouge already gone down to the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them cast a nostalgic recalls at the time of the movement.
Although a few elite of the Khmer Rouge preserves its local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
'these people should surrender only minimum benefit, "said leang shock from the centre for justice and reconciliation, which leads the public forum for the whole of Cambodia, including anlong vengu.
'They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology of the regime'.
'were vychování without any ideas about implementing trade'.

The trial of the Khmer Rouge also provoked fears.
At the beginning of next year will be the Court investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng thirith, another former Minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The Court has the mandate to prosecute leading přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but has not been said, whether it will also continue to these four cases.
This was a little, in order to calm the fears in anlong vengu.

Prime Minister Hun Sen, who přeběhl from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also has repeatedly warned that it comes to instability, if the Court to seek further suspects, although with the experts and historians.

But public forum textbooks and court are starting to have influence, told the further.

Belarus agrees that seems to their stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium
In did with its surprise victory in the campaign of President Obama on ensuring nuclear material around the world, announced by the Government of Belarus on Wednesday that give up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in the joint statement issued after the security summit the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Martynov sergeiem.
The American government has for years sought to persuade Belarus to surrendered highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the stumbling block discovered last spring.
But American officials have said the Washington Post, that in the last two months, it was with Belarus carried out a few clandestine operations in order to eliminate 187 pounds weapons on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research facilities.
It has prepared the ground for the agreement to the removal of the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to the official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive issue.
The agreement has proved to be one of the most important results of the Obama 47. national summit on nuclear safety in April, which was Belarus be removed.
And was probably a good move to ensure the invitation to the former Soviet Republic on the subsequent summit in 2012.
'I was really fascinated by the fact that want to place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012.'
'This shows that this process works, "said Ken luongo, the President of the partnership for global security, the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called 'agreement as a very important, an important step' from Belarus.
Obama has promised in Prague in April 2009 that will ensure all sensitive nuclear materials throughout the world in the four years.
Since then, the US government has helped the six countries to get rid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At a time of Obama's summit on nuclear safety has announced the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, that his nation never give up its uranium.
'We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is, in fact, the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium, "said then Lukashenko.
'It is our commodity... we are not going to produce dirty bombs, and we are not going to anyone to sell'.
'we use it only for research purposes, that is all.'
Belarus, however, a few months ago acceded to the United States and we have an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to eliminate the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly ozářen, announced officials.
It was naložen on special train travelled more than 1 300 million in the Russian facilities for the storage and disposal, said the officials.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, said the officials.
The US government for the programme it has spent 13 million dollars, the majority of this on the delivery of the Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not appropriate for the production of nuclear weapons.
'everything was zkoordinováno very carefully and conducted on the basis of confidence', which led to an agreement signed by the Clinton said Andrew bieniawski, the servant of the Department of Energy working for a global nuclear reduction effort.
James Martin centres for the study on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year odhadovalo that Belarus has at least GBP 88 uranium applicable for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, seek to eliminate their reserves until 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were throughout the years tense, and that, above all, because of the lukašenkově brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday statement suggests the possibility of a gradual melting.
'We welcome the progress made in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its population,' he said.
The Spanish Government did with the CIA flights drahoty
The Spanish Government did drahoty on CIA flights carrying trapped talibance and Al-Qaida members in Guantánamo via the Spanish teritorium, as expressed in its telegramu envoy of the United States in Madrid.
So this stems from the documents provided by serverem WikiLeaks newspaper El País, where also writes that the representative of the first Prime Minister María Teresa fernándezová de la vegová asked to be informed the Spanish executive and 'could thus to show that it has a proper supervision of foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish air space'.
In June 2006, following the communication from the Council of Europe, in which it was on a dozen States, including Spain on charges of complicity in the violation of human rights, we held a meeting between the US ambassador eduardem Aguirre and fernándezovou de la vegovou.
As the Prime Minister said that the communication from the Council of Europe 'vyňalo the Zapatero government from the Games' and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la vegová stress that Spain has no problem with the years ago of the secret services across its territory.
'simply want to be only informed', that they are 'zastiženi off-hand' Aguirre, says in one of the documents.
Also the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos has indicated the American Ambassador, that the Spanish government 'I give this issue the lowest possible outlines, but the fact that this subject has been in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited opportunities for influence'.
In February 2007 prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that, if his concerns, does not intend to block the initiative to judge odtajnění received the national centre of the secret services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to the CIA flights.
'the information they contain no inkriminovanou component of any sensitive information' vysvětlilo embassy after the conversation with prokurátorem.
Nevertheless, the US have expressed concerns rather because of the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors' than because of odtajnění information CNI or defence ministry.
'This coordination between the independent experts will complicate our efforts to deal with this case discreetly between governments' regrets the Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of their lunch the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez rubalcaby, told us that, although the ambassadors' are Spanish judges very jealous of their independence and do what will be considered appropriate 'commissioned already instructions to their associates' whether they avoid rozohněným comments with the intention of reducing tensions'.
The Ambassador of also expresses its concern about the political parties of the Partido Popular (PP; česky People's Party - massive fly-tipping.) in this matter.
'despite its general pro-American orientation of our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to use any signs that zapaterova government tolerated or deliberately ignored the negotiations the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and even in the event that this revelation could have negative consequences for the government of the United States' notes.

The PP would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (the Socialist Party of Catalonia - massive fly-tipping) would lose 9 mandates.
With the results of 28 November would PP Party could have the floor for municipalities in léridě, Tarragona, and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections katalánská PP (the People's Party Catalonia - massive fly-tipping.) already has the idea of general elections, whether it comes to increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes in national elections is usually one such katalánských compared to the elections.
In 2008 the PP katalánští gained in the general election 610.473 votes, while in the election of the autonomous from 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, gained the PPC (the People's Party Catalonia) 384.091 voice.
If this tendency increases, which was supported by transferring the votes from the PSC and firm voters PP, analysts this party have calculated that if elections general, PPC could obtain 12 Members in the House compared with current 8, party ciu (Convergencia even Unió, česky agreement and the Union - massive fly-tipping.) would gain also 4 mandates (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia has for the PP and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) is of fundamental importance.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (left-wing Republican Party Catalonia - massive fly-tipping.) has lost one Members - now has 3 - while icv (initiative of the Greens for Catalonia - massive fly-tipping.) should remain one of the mandate, or would gain even one another.
However, according to the parliamentary calendar will take the earliest dostaveníčko held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the PP could also have a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the Socialists in the four main provincial towns and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the greatest projected budget - 661 million euro for 2011.
As the nationalists, so the PP coincide with the possibility that the PSC could lose the municipalities in Barcelona, Tarragona, léridě and geroně where Socialists received majority and nor would be unable to draw on its traditional allies, the ERC and icv.
Given the debacle of Republicans would not be impossible if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona zastupitelstvu - because it is necessary to get at least 5% of the votes.
The party PP has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, léridě and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that could play a major role in turnover in Tarragona, where essentially, together with the PP Party before the current mayor, josepem félixem ballesterosem.
In léridě gained the PP only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with marianem rajoyem - during the last campaign met on several occasions.
The PP gained also on other important municipalities, such as badalona castelldeels or reus.
Currently the PP representation on the 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would create a candidate in what is perhaps the most municipalities.
Katalánská cell has provided the Al Qaeda organisation thousands of passports
In addition to the seven of the detainees in Barcelona, have been detained another three in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one nigerijec, who were detained agents of the information komisařství in Barcelona, constituted jihadi cell controlled from Thailand, which zařizovala passports Al Qaeda organisation between the various groups, which were also 'tigers Liberation Tamil Eelam' or 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', while the second group was the author of the assassinations in Mumbai, in which 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure through the 'operation kampai' weakening padělatelského apparatus al-Qaeda at international level and 'limit and its operational capacity'.
Investigators estimate that this cell might during the two years, when it was in Catalonia active, send thousands of passports in Thailand, where then have been counterfeited and then dodávány groups, which are criminal galaxii Al-Qaida to their 'fighters' could with impunity to travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This was not the only active broken cell, which should network jihad in Europe, and that is why these investigations in addition to buoyant services also took part in the next European police units, and cannot be ruled out, so that in the next few days will not happen in the other European countries to similar intervention, as was the in Barcelona last Tuesday at night.
In connection with this operations (when they were detained Pakistanis, junaid humayun atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, Malik Ahmad, Iftikhar Mohammad saddique Khan begum, tanveer arshad and nigerijec babatunde agunbiade) in Thailand is developed further in which they were captured by the Pakistanis Muhammad athar butt and zeeshan Ehsan butt and thajec sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
It was precisely these men who ran from Bangkok cell residing in Spain and the other in other European countries.
Katalánská network, whose part was removed in 2009, kradla especially tourists passports, which comply with the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that the documents have to be men in the age of 25% to 45 years, have had to have a force for several years and be without vyznačených visas.
In the investigation documents is pointed out that are not yet aware of any facts that would linking detainees from Catalonia with that in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', should be one of the groups, which received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that, a few days before this that have been sent from Catalonia transfer by about $1,000, which were 'put' on the purchase of cards to mobile phones, which later were used members' commandos', which killed 106 people.
The police have already have seized many evidence.
The People's Party (PP) calls upon the masovi to stop fiscal agreement
President the PPC (the People's Party Catalonia) alicia sánchezový-camachová yesterday had the opportunity to present personally, Mr masovi their conditions under which it is willing to support its introduction to the office of President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is the recovery of the economy and the renunciation of risky enterprises such as economic agreement, which wants to the leader of the nationalists to propose during his mandate.
The President of the people's katalánských has arrived at a meeting with arturem meat with the certainty of the 18 MEPs seats received in elections last Sunday, which is number more than satisfactory for obtaining approval ratings, thus candidate ciu needs to at least one of the formations that make up the opposition abstained from the vote on the appointment of his office.
On the possible agreement with the PP depend the future of the Alliance, which would like to keep the nationalists in this House, when they place general elections, but so far, talks which leads in these days of the masses with the rest of the political leaders, bear in Catalan spirit.
As regards the President PP to obtain its support for the introduction of the office, 'will have to put an end to all the sovereign and liberation speeches', as well as with economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque country - on which I leader ciu even to vote in a referendum.
The two leaders would like to slim down inflated political apparatus autonomous administration and reduce the estate and darovací taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the masova induction into functions will be dealt with in the framework of the PP Jordi cornet and dolors Montserrat.
Masses already met joaquinem nadalem (PSC), which promised the hard opposition, joanem herrerou (icv) and today meets with joanem puigcercósem (ERC), Albert riverou (ciutadans) and joanem laportou (solidaritat catalana).
The Director of the geriatrického facilities reassuring that deaths occurred as a result of the 'lack of measures'
The presentation of the center olot exclusive that their pečovatel killed more than 11 clients
Leadership geriatrického centre la caritat de olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference to vylíčilo what damage caused the institution of criminal behaviour Joana villas dilmé, carers, which - mezitímco here was employed - killed at least eleven of elderly people, which should in care.
The Director of this homes for the elderly, Joan sala come in by a lawyer equipment, a lawyer Joana canady, and announced that 'the wishes of home la caritat would be able to make accusations against viníkovi' responsible for killing, but 'legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process of the relevant authorities'.
In addition to the damage to the good name of this institution, which may suffer because of the fact that in time revealed the criminal activities of carers, a major threat to the home la caritat are now demands on material compensation, which have already been calculating legal representatives of families pozůstalých.
Joan Vila dilmé admitted that his first crime is udál already in August 2009, and that since then nepřestal kill
Judge ordered the exhumaci eight bodies clients homes for the elderly with suspicion, that in many cases the deceased neprohlížel no doctor, personally, but that - given the age and poor health check patients - everything vyřizovalo after the phone.
La caritat yesterday through its director resolutely rejected this extreme and stress that 'the lack of measures could not be in any case, the cause of which there has been'.
The legal representative of La caritat add that 'in case there are no indications that it would in addition to own the accused any third person made error'.
Man nicknamed now 'Angel of death' admitted yesterday 11 killing and made it clear that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed the second stařenku.
In this case, has caused the death of a submission too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case, when used a mixture of comforting tabletek.
The Director of the La caritat this said that it is difficult to control access to medikamentům staff.
Inzulín and cocktails sedativ were probably in six cases of nine means by which this pečovatel užíval to patients killing in its attempt to relieve their suffering.
But only analysis, which is now under way in a laboratory, should show whether Vila don't lie and really sought for its first victims less cruel death or, on the contrary, it is killed louhu publicly, as has already been admitted in the case of three women were killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La caritat believe zdravotníkovým claims and nor do not rule out that the number of people killed can be higher than what has admitted and justify its behaviour in different versions, which give Vila court with the knowledge that must change its negotiations, when it became clear that killed eight people.
I therefore say that they want to be available to the judiciary to be osvětlen the whole range of this matter.
The European Central Bank risk
Investors yesterday responded rapidly to yesterday's threat to the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who pointed out that 'markets should not underestimate our ability to react'.
Peripheral diferenciály are closed force and shares the European banks have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also underestimate the capacity of the European Central Bank to err - the euro has just increased over critical value.
This happened yesterday, is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a downturn is recovering - but, thanks to the short and very speculative positions.
Investor will take some time before lose concerns.
A month ago the European Central Bank quoted today to take back the peace of liquidity and, tomorrow, we will have to have already for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank has called for an end to the plan for buying up the national debt for the ineffectiveness and the elimination of all the extraordinary rates of liquidity in the deadline and leave the unrestricted access only after a period of one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the level of liquidity forecast 'at least until March' and keep the three-month licitaci with unlimited access to the end of this trimesters, so as to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue its programme of buying bonds and that even announce his intensifying.
Nenaplní-li created expectations, create again the reaction of the markets for yesterday, and if will continue to blindly to continue in the withdrawal of the degree of liquidity, God with us!
The same was at the Congress in May, where argued that neither neuvažovali on buying bonds, and there has been a collapse of the markets - tomorrow could history to repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustained.
In May, it announced pancéřová fist on Monday and in the centre, I note that many of them are already purchased, thereby further triggered by the collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auctioning holdings to one year in Portugal was a very poor.
El tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared with 750 million with 4.81% from the previous one.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points, odrážejíce so change of mood in the market, which were made after the words Trichet.
In Ireland was published figures are allied losses and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amount roughly 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15.000 in February have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility, then what in July problem nor stresovými tests, sums are within the framework of the support plan acceptable and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday will need government to gain the approval of a new budget Parliament and still does not have sufficient support, so that in Ireland there is still uncertainty.
Angela Merkel ease the tone of your speech, to ease the tensions in the face for the next meeting of the leaders of the EU held on 14 December, at which it is necessary to reach a political compromise, which would show that we are a Union, and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather beethovenovu ódu to joy.
Prime Minister yesterday in Spain had the opportunity to present a plan of action which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous areas and financial institutions, the reduction in the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to stimulate employment - in uší investors this sounds like four annual period from vivaldiho.
Double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, which is doubly than other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February was the response of the government and the Spanish national banks rapid and convincing - perhaps we are benefiting from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key licitaci bond for three years, which will be a beneficiary always effect Trichet, which, we hope, for it will be a great demand, which will help to dispel doubts about our ability refinancing.
To ask for a rescue plan would be for Spain self-sacrifice.
It would give us a cash, which we do not need - in El tesoro is available 40.000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets, we concluded a sine die.
However, it is important to continue to use the strategy cesarovy women - 'not only by vowed, but also with the zdáti'.
We can do it.

The last step Juan Carlos, pabla, Emilia, Marty and elviry álvarezových mezquirizových considers David Álvarez for 'a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial stratagems and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations on 18 January, which was totally invalid'.

In the team is working today be prohibited from mixing Red Bull 180 young highly qualified professionals with executive information technology, who analysing and propose every type of modification závodních vehicles.
Leading from the Siemens explained that software plm is able to analyse and improve all the elements závodních vehicles be prohibited from mixing Red Bull with the exception of the engine for the Renault which fully accountable.
In, respectively, materials, fuel, aerodynamika and security elements.
The changes it is possible to transfer from the virtual reality into reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to the advanced production systems through laseru and highly technologically advanced autokláv.
The only limit of this technical achievements is the sum of $40 million, which represents the best that can each team Formula 1 issue for every period to improve their competitiveness.
Be prohibited from mixing Red Bull establish roughly 50 km from London a race to the top technologies serving to design and the production of their závodních vehicles.
It is about two buildings, in which it is limited by the entry going - especially journalists.
What is happening here is considered to be the 'great secrecy'.
The list of zúčastěných this project with 580 persons, including the two pilots - champion vettela and Marek webbera.
The hero of the Red bullu is in the Formula 1 without doubt fresh champion Sebastian vettel.
For nezměrnými technological means that the label of energy drinks inserted into their participation in závodních headings, however, masks the other players whose aid is invaluable, and no one knows.
The head of the production technology Steve nevey argue that, five years ago, it was possible to say that advances in research and the development of vehicles contribute to the victory of 50%, and the rest was due to Horsemen.
At the moment, this ratio changed and technology stands for the achievements of the 85%, while the pilots contribution from the 15%.
Nevey recognises that vettel or webber will never be replaced computer technology, because they are 'nepředvídatelní gladiátoři'.

The North American company přichystala plan on the establishment of the 200 sales jobs in Europe up to 2013, which includes 20 of the Spanish trades.
The first shops were opened in Bucharest last week (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), trade in Barcelona is therefore the third.

Sabadell emphasizes that 'who has stolen' during the three years of its competitors million clients
More optimistic than the other bosses delegovaný Member of the Council of the banks Banco sabadell, Jaime guardiola, believes that 2011 for the Bank will be ambitious, but refuses to a new liquidity crisis and forecast the end of passive war.
Yet envisaged by lowering interest rates, but who will try to compensate for the slevněním bank charges and prices of credit.
Sabadell, it is expected that it will manage during the three years to obtain a million private clients.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years, and so can survive in the difficult economic conditions.
The Bank in 2011 will trigger a new strategic plan with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survive without the need to go to the public aid in frob gain market share podchycením million new private clients - or 700.000 odečtou-li, those who leave or bank - because until now Ai constitutions hýčkal rather small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than small clients.
This year has already received the Bank 250.000 private clients and 50.000 enterprises.
Its share of the market is doing, if it is a private clients 3.5%, while for corporate zákazníku this is more than 10%.
Another of the fundamental ideas plan 2011-2013 is the commitment to productivity, or can be said also attain, with the aim of reducing costs, which will prove to be up to the challenges of the Bank, will present the results for the period.
Few banking institutions in this time of daring to set targets and publish it, because the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the global banking.
This year will sabadell optima set out its programme, four years ago, although originally was for three years, but the situation on the markets require enlargement for the next period.
Clients who departs from the loan crises will be their main target group.
At a meeting hosted by the apie guardiola insisted on the fact that the year 2011 will be 'heavy and very important'.
Indeed, considers that the way out of the crisis in Spain 'will be lengthy'.
In addition, it will be for two or three years' very difficult to create employment ', which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, to add.
And although believes that passive war - which reduces the margins - away, the price of přirážek for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to received liquidity, has already passed on to the price of credit, thereby compensate for the reduction in the margins.
'The subject of liquidity and funding is structural and will constitute a factor of pressure on credit'.
'We have to conclude diferenciály tap, but there are a lot of high' guardiola acknowledged.
BANESTO already issued its network of on Thursday orders, have been reduced to long-term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see cincodías from 22 and 27 November.
Also recognised that the tendencies in banking 'now is reducing the Commissions', but here is' competitive framework '.
The strategic plan banks sabadell based on once growth, but as usual group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain reassuring that in Spain 'will demand more of the size of the'.
'the next year will be left to erase cornerstone' assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are 'much reduced' and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions comes between the red figures.
And points out that, frob May on the market suplovat collecting funds before new measure of capital.
After the assurances that sabadell can survive a temporary closure of markets, remains a serious problem of what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that cannot be issue, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through the repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes other a wave of mergers loan crises
The Director-General CECA refused yesterday, that it should be another wave of mergers loan crises, and once again insisted on the speed with which it is carrying out the reorganisation of the sector.
When we started the process of association of the Spanish loan crises, it was a number of institutions that ujišťovaly that this first phase will wait and in the second round.
However, the director of the Spanish confederation of loan crises (CECA), José Antonio is ruled olavarrieta yesterday, that it should be a new wave of these operations.
'I believe that most of the mergers have already been implemented, inkorporaci cajasolu into the Banca cívica cannot be considered the second round, that what is happening is the Convention'.
'majority is fully implemented; it is possible that, instead of 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish national banks, which in this matter has been working very well, "said the director.
In its statements on the meeting of the adea (the Association of senior officials and Executive aragonu - massive fly-tipping.) olavarrieta described, that the process of concentration is' the highest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied, as it shows in installments that his time, not now, appeared in a business plans with the Spanish National Bank ', pointed out.
'to move from 45 loan crises, with an average of assets 28.000 million to 17, 75.500 million is a process that is unique in the history of the comparison, redukujíce so the number of institutions about the 62%, so that these have been greater, and thus, in line with the Basel Treaty', to underline that point.
Olavarrieta recognized that 'there are a number of not very fortunate opinions on the slowness of the process', which show 'lack of seriousness and understanding', because the 'What does the Spanish national bank is reminding that we must be before the end of the year in the term'.
The Director-General CECA José Antonio is assured olavarrieta yesterday, that Spain has the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and 'probably' and in the world, and those who cast doubt on this, awarded 'lack of knowledge'.
The Director of the said that, in the current favourable economic situation 'can be assured' with regard to the financial institutions and the loan crises and the system which has sufficient resources' very important 'process of concentration and which continues' the highest possible rate '.
I also remind you that the Spanish banking became very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose for maintaining the euro, but set out the conditions for the whole of the Union.
The tension on the markets provoked double the government's response.
On the one hand, a suggestion, José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from the tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private zprostředkovacích agencies or the abolition of 426 the euro without benefits for the unemployed, after the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - massive fly-tipping.), the manager of airports Barajas Airport and El Prat and 30% state lotteries.
Vice-President Elena salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the criticisms about Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret this pohnutí?
Let it be said that the position in advance, Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinice the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what is to be its future, which runs the idea of respect for the old traditions, which holds a large part of the other Members.
In the face of the European resistance in Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of these is the strong euro area, which would be just Germany, but also in Austria, for example, or the Netherlands, while the southern states would monetary zone abandoned.
The second is a return to the Deutschmark now - although this may seem scifi, this version has broad public support, the approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is according to the German proposals recast of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary severity, penalties for the guilty States possible delay payments for some of them, and with the extension of the possible costs on the regulation on the private sector.
The German position is clear and it has already been some time defines, so there is no room for quibbling now.
First of all, when, in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission should encourage deficits basement has pulled from the German Government constitutional reform, to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first indication of the contradiction between what it considered Germany for the right (plans fiscal rigour and the stability of public finances), and thus what praktikovali his European partners, including France.
The second has shown this a central European country, when Merkel painfully protahovala decision on the rescue of Greece.
Then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, have been strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October's days, Merkel has once again with a clear position when requested to reform of the Convention of the European Union, so that it was possible to the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, to private creditors have the duty to bear some of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as the anti-European, as was precipitated by the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although in a somewhat zmírněné form, was approved and, during the next few months we should monitor the reform process of the Union, which should from 2013 to enable these measures.
Germany took the red line that it does not intend to go.
And all the commentary tells us that, although it is now to be done measures, which probably too, since this data will be old the functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the birth of the new monetary zone in which the Member States will be violating the rules of hard sankcionovány and can be forced to report the postponement of the payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to give the rigorous way to growth, increasing the degree of savings and investment, moderate consumption, the improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims was and building, with vast loopholes in the balance of payments, what was in the booming years growth of Spain, simply not going to tolerate.
The supply is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we understood this.
It is not only about the resumption of the public deficit of 3% in 2013.
What they want is for us a much harder.
And the worst thing is that, under these conditions, we can state that zmýlíme themselves.
I hope that these will replace the current turbulence greater calm.
And that we will use the opportunity, which give us in the spring 2013.
It seems that the Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and his dual statement (reforms promised, after a meeting with large businesses from the last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) gives suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, opening the way to the idea that it is necessary to put things in order.
But the red line, which Germany set itself, there is, and it does not seem that would like to move.
And from the opportunities which can be considered, we cannot abandon the euro area full of not very serious countries ruled out.
Well, Germany, we will always be able to say that US varovalo.
Sport and circumvent the rules
What demonstrated finty Alonso and Ramos in the struggle with ajaxem savvy, show not the intention to escape punishment.
Supposedly contrived exclusion two players also undermined export competitiveness Madrid (xabiho alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the struggle against ajaxu Champions League of 23 November meant that it was vypsáno sea brushes about whether this is or is not nesportovní behaviour, and whether eventuelně UEFA both footballers should not be punished.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the struggle (who had their team clearly vyhraný) appointed players one after the second deliberately losing time at the very moment when the should play, being so vyprovokovali sudího, and show them the yellow card.
In this way, the two players meets the requisite punishment in the struggle against auxerre - with real Madrid ends in my group at the forefront of - and will be able, deprived of cards, continue into the next phase.
Finally, given the Commission disciplinary UEFA trenéru José mourinhovi punishment on two matches and but guilty players received money fine.
The provocation of yellow cards for similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, and so the rules, which are an unwritten, but are.
Part of the debate in this case arose due to the fact that its presence was a team of real Madrid (which in its anthem boast šlechetností and honour, and which has already for similar actions its player pokutoval) and, it seems, also thanks to the dramatizaci led by mourinhem, which thus adds to its long history komedianta and provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of negotiations, which is not the rules explicitly banned, is in conflict with the principles of sport, namely whether these deeds in place to circumvent the law; it is indeed about the action respecting sporting rules, whose sense, however, seems to be trying to do.
With what type of damage such negotiations are sport spirit.
One of the formalities of sports behaviour is physical inviolability protihráčů, which was not in these cases violated, or not to violent game.
Another of these formalities that characterise clean game is avoiding players, thanks to the offence towards team opponent advantage - which also here.
Therefore the paradox of action players also undermined export competitiveness Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, as normally charakterizujeme as deceit or circumventing the law, not the overt infringement of the rules in order to avoid the situation, but this behaviour should be seen as much as possible with the aim of punishment to receive.
Wait and punishment.
The other question, however, is what advantage culprits from its deliberate infringement will have.
Here it is necessary to say that a competitor to the disadvantaged position, and that in the current struggle can't get no benefit, because an obvious consequence is that the team itself, will have fewer players.
And nor is it useful strategy into further struggle, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage of the clearly lies in the fact that the players to start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future struggle.
However, this is on the edge of a long-term perspective and with some degree of neurčitosti, therefore, at first sight, can be eliminated as a team, and beyond that this negotiation we odbudou players punishment, and switch to the second round of the cards in which to the exclusion of just one card less than in the first round.
So how will round to continue, not very clear whether it is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, part of which is to make strategic decisions which will make it possible to gain maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the case of which we are dealing with here, the players should not aim to avoid granting the death (which would have been a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather choose when to him.
Do the strategic decisions without avoid the death or before they ran.
Although it is not the borders between the resourcefulness and circumvention of rules quite clear, I believe that, in this case, clearly was savvy.
It seems to me that the controversy arises from two reasons: because it was two samovyloučení and because of the way it was the transfer of instructions to their provocation from the leadership.
Damage to the sporting principles of these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
The fight offers on the organisation of the Christmas parties in Barcelona
Diktat calendar concentrated this year a spate of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The rapidly increasing celebrations, all the workers themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 of the euro.
As well as the Turkish MED or lotteries, with the arrival of the December once again come pre-Christmas street parties that still operate as kyslíková bomb for restaurants and facilities for free time in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis have resulted in the fight to obtain clients reducing prices: almost all want for food to spend 20 to 30 euro, coincide with the dotázaní entrepreneurs and association for this sector.
To conclude, the numbers hitch zkoncentroval calendar this year (when Christmas day was on Friday) requests for a week since 13 December, there was a flurry of reservations on the days in the top (16 and 17), whereas in the previous week has been almost no traffic.
As has happened since 2008, when began meagre years, there are many companies that collective street parties from budgetary reasons abolished.
Not abandoned to tradition, many employees is footing on večírcích from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the border of ability to bear, says the President associations restaurants gremi de restauració de Barcelona, gaieta farras.
Representative patronátu restaurant facilities at the moment does not dare to predict what will be the celebration of this month.
'people have a good mind than do reserve'.
'they want to, but when it comes to the subject of prices, are careful' provides.
Shops will go well those 'who will offer the quality and good service at a favourable price', says and recalls that, thanks to the crisis have customers tend to go on the degree of mines and most zákazníku now wants to spend around 25 of the euro.
A survey in the various plants shows that the greatest brunt of requests for reserve is on the evening on 17 December.
Soteras Group endorses the real boom reservations on Friday, while most requirements is to spend 30 to the euro, which adapt the menu, whose overall prices are from 25 to 30 of the euro.
In the other major companies, which is andilana, consisting of 16 facilities in the town of (hostal de la Rita, market, La fonda and other), has brought peculiarity of this calendar more Early booking and that since the beginning of November.
'We have made possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, of which should choose anyone moving from 19,95 to 30, indicate the euro'.
In the Group of an grup, which includes El mussol, attic ququ numbering, and a total of 23 enterprises remain optimistic, having seen since the second half of the increase in profits and have a relatively sound prospects for Christmas sales.
The resources of this society also point out that, on 18 December will vytíženým day, as will take place pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
To my six gang menu added menu Christmas, with a budget of the euro on the 30 or more, as seen in comparison with the previous year tend to visitors spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (the Spanish šumivé wine - massive fly-tipping.).
Also seen that there are companies which, once again, zvou their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is something more.
VicePresident society fecasarm (which includes the institutions such as the association of bars, restaurants and centres of free time in Barcelona) enric Goma believes that begins to see the end of the tunnel, and says that the number of reservations' revived ', although clients' bargain on the maximum '.
This impression, even during the Christmas celebrations neustoupil, whether, who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced a great deal of turbulence in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons' at a faster pace than any other country '.
WikiLeaks documents confirm the links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US by the State Department published portal WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest in Washington is Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the objasňujících and important details, which offer on the content of the communication and ideas of the North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that the cooperation between the two States, when it comes to nuclear safety, rather than to increase ', is on the wane', and that this unstable Asiatic countries producing nuclear weapons' more than any other state '.
Peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that his weapons are not smontovány store, but after the components to be znesnadněna their destruction in the case of the attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
This calculated ambassador in Pakistan Anne W. pattersonová in one report before the visit of the National Security Adviser James Jones: 'the proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials'.
The increased number of persons associated with nuclear arsenály and with the programme cruise missiles is already pozorován only the US, but also Russia, as the spreading and presenting a reason to be vigilant.
'Pakistan had to the protection of nuclear facilities to recruit staff with strict religious faith; given the decline of the level of education and culture have extremist organisations more opportunities recruit people who will work in the nuclear programmes or programmes cruise missiles', said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with our counterparts in the US.
The largest new documentation published serverem Juliana assangeho is increasingly lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on subjects of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased rate of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Cable ambasádou issued in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as' frustrating, "says: 'there is often no transparency; offers of assistance remain unchallenged or are rejected'.
In another report notes the Peter lavoy, worker of national intelligence services for South Asia that ', despite the economic disaster produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country in the world'.
Ambassador pettersonová also asks the Washington to during his visit to the head of the army general ashfaqa kayaniho 'very well established' that 'the Pakistani army must put an end to a silent support terrorist groups'.
The quest for WikiLeaks
Obama will designate the senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, in order to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol is issuing a call 'red' with a view to trace and identify where would Assange could be.
Everything concerning the WikiLeaks founder and his Juliana assangeho are complicated labyrinth, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday 'emergency call', the so-called 'red notice, to' lokalizování and monitoring of the movement of 'assangeho.
But it is not a classic order in detention.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates on 20 November.
And has nothing to do with the last of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, reassuring legal representative of the inventor of the WikiLeaks mark Stephens that 'police knows where and how the contact with Mr assangem'.
It was 20 November when the College international police based in the French Lyon issued this order at the request of Sweden, nezveřejnil it, however, until yesterday, when received authorisation from the Swedish authorities.
For this situation has 188 countries Interpol guidelines to identify or location assangeho 'with the aim of imposing on him temporary link and give it'.
Although Interpol cannot impose the detention of persons, which relates to the red challenge, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, however, consider the so-called red notice for enabling arrests carried out - this must be ensured national component of the police - especially in the case of the, when countries are bilateral agreement on the issuing of the detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where it would probably be Assange should be.
This step pohoršil assengeho legal practitioners, who yesterday publikovali writing, where they are saying that devětatřicetiletý WikiLeaks founder shown a willingness to answer questions the Swedish authorities through the videoconference.
Recall also that assenge asked permission to leave and subsequently received from Sweden prokurátorky its case that comparisons with the legendary lavrentijem pavlovičem berijou, head of Stalin's security.
'This is a witch-hunt, and no legal persecution', to the letter.
While it is looking for the whole world - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange is increasingly in an unknown location, but nemlčí.
On Monday, provided through with Skype from unknown places interviews editor-in-chief magazine time - in this interview demanded the demise of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
'If it turns out that was responsible for the warrant the diplomats of the US to engage in espionage in the UN and so have infringed the international conventions, which the United States signed, it should resign,' said.
His opinion was yesterday rejected tiskovým spokesman of the White House Robert gibbsem which kvalifikoval requirement demise as' ridiculous and absurd '.
'I am not sure, why should we should depend on the opinion individua, which has a website', said on CNN.
Obama himself has appointed senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, rusella traverse that prevents the next evasion documents.
The intention of the President Barack Obama to stop to add assangemu on the importance of the conflict with the views, which these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, member of Congress, which will from January to chair the Committee on national security in the House of Commons, asked the Foreign Ministry, to explore the possibility of WikiLeaks include between terrorist organisations, 'to be able to intervene and to prosecute anyone who would assist them financially or otherwise provide aid'.
This has gone even further flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, there who said that Assange should 'to be killed', which then had to appeal.
'Obama would on it should hold reward or to use bezpilotní plane or something'.
Who did was Mike Huckabee, baptistický priest, the former guvernátor Arkansas and possible candidate for President.
'anyone will be in government, who is responsible for the release of information, made a betrayal and any other punishment than execution would have been far too lenient', said at the station Fox
Puigcercós is looking for in the ERC calm 'pomrkáváním' gains caroda
Republican leader will allow the hand of a secret vote on its continuance.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and the end of the schůzovního system.
Joan puigcercós probably found a recipe, how to combat already několikátou internal upheavals in the ranks of the ERC (left-wing Republican Party Catalonia - massive fly-tipping.) bezvýslednou due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that his gesture on the demise seems backers of the former leader of the Josep lluíse caroda-roviry insufficient, and also knows that the impact of this sector is now already weakened myself as its leader, and that it absolutely cannot do such concerns what should with other zaniklými currents.
Therefore, the leader of the left will try to obtain new criticism by pomrkávání, which will help it to shield in municipal elections.
First of all, puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to secretly to speak on his remaining in office.
With ballot papers, not the catch-the-eye procedure.
If they wish to caroda supporters handed over to the President of a voice, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, wants to avoid the head of division and to subjugate its people.
In several talks, argued that would not consider potvrzeného with half of the votes and one, moreover, but add without clarify%, that would also have been a good outcome 'after Bulgaria'.
Supporters of the caroda demand after President more than to give its function available - which are considered gesture, which does not have any weight, because puigcercós controls on sjezdech the greatest authority.
But, given that they do not have a sufficient majority in order to enforce demise, will try to remind the executive plan from now until May.
Because of this, expect that they will participate in the drafting of the document on the strategic reorientaci, which can lead to vote on in the National Council of 18 months ago.
Their aim is to support the puigcercóse in exchange for promises that this postponement of the Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that 'mnohohlasnost' damages stability, and that its aim is to be able to compete once and for all, the organisation of their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, seems to be symptomatic rule, which the current adviser, Josep huguet signed on his blog.
Then, what has taken into consideration the puigcercósův ideologue, this advisor for innovation has taken for a fait accompli that leader will be confirmed by the 'in exchange for several objectives'.
And those appointed five, of which excel two.
The first is the 'překomponování' executive to represent at least 90% of Members, which means also to include new faces, who are from the sector nakloněného carodovi.
The second objective can be a great innovation.
Huguet proposes to bring an end to the ERC completely schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of operation.
And so is fighting for the reform of the Statute, so that it can take place through separate congresses delegates selected the vote.
Doing away with the model schůzovního system, as an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, it is intended to puigcercósova team who fought in this regard already on the last two sjezdech.
However, cramped Assembly from 2008, decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special Congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still nevyřízená, because the situation inside the party is discouraged from dealing with this matter.
Now, without číhajících critical sectors could be a good moment to address this issue and to try to conclude it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November 390 for 2010;
According to the newspaper milenio recorded Mexico fall by 4 cases in comparison with the year 2010.

Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed 42 Republican Senators could influence the vote on the law dream act and on other projects, such as, for example, on the ratification of the new treaty with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons, entitled 'start.

With literature insert a finger in the wounds ('poner El dedo en la llaga' translated 'to put a finger in the wounds' is the equivalent of the Czech 'strike the nail on the head - massive fly-tipping.)
The second round of the cycle pleasure from the language was promenádou, where the participants demonstrated gala presentation of literary
'This is sex in the language I can understand, but... fingers into the wounds? what awaits me?', questioning the novelist Luisa valenzuelová, which was invited to start the second round of the pleasure of language, cycle, which celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used in this opportunity as podtitulek (on another fair to table devoted the subject of sex in language, to explain).
A finger in the wounds' brings us into narrow ', she líbezně Argentine writer to the audience, složenému mainly young people, which had gathered on the international knižním exhibition in guadalajaře to vyslechlo this debate for a round table moderovanou marisol schultzovou and with the participation of the valenzuelové, Sergio ramíreze, mayry monterové and Luis García montera.
Luisa valenzuelová read the text, which paid gonzalu celoriovi and which schultzová called then for the excellent povídku in which speaks Luisa in the first person as protagonistka, which in the search for a knowledge of what is' blow 'go from doctors to doctors, from which it does not answer although traces of the same story yes.
Since infektologa leaving believe: 'patience is not my strong point, perhaps it will be my blow'.
Eventually, after the frustration with traumatologem which it has taken its breath in the middle of the road, but explain that wound is not scientific term, this is the psychoanalyst, which reveals this secrecy: 'blow this represents a truly rozevřené and this is a symbolic jizva'.
Protagonistka, odlehčeně povzdychla and concluded that 'ráně it has managed to learn just as much, that is what is really rozevřeným and that there is no', but took the belief that pleasure and in the language of the pitfalls must go hand in hand.
The novelist valenzuelová played with both.
Nikaragujec Sergio Ramírez also speak with rozkošným vyprávěním, which he called the praise of invention, in which it is not a finger in ráně appointed, but in one moment emerge.
With the elements of the magical realism tells the famous čarodějce, which has played a cloud, brought back to the people, who have gone far or napravovala počestnost, which has lost one heads, this narrative, which then turned to speak America, great novel in which from the outset nechyběli his own kronikáři who telling him, and there is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which criticises the exaggerations in any talk of captains.
'Cervantes, which all of us (writer) humans, derided fingovaným testimony, which was presented as the real story, but in a different way, has never been the story of America with such obrazotvorností, which lacked even shame'.
However, pointed out, 'It is crazy and liars, who have greater imagination' and that is precisely where merges the fact lie, and where no longer know what from the story belongs to one group and in the second, amounts to a fictitious literature its peak.
This calls indeed 'cervantovskou tradition'.
'thanks to his legacy we have what we have'.
Subsequently Mayra monterová stressed and commend the diversity of interpretation, which the invitation of international book fair, with its besedou a finger to enable the wounds.
Kubánsko-portorická novelist has shown its finger on a great blow to social violence which is undergoing its countries - and it shares Latin America - and it is a consequence of the trade disputes and sale of drugs.
'I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close silent compromise, which, of course, is not intended', said, having said that, the reality of literature is communications and dimensions of the compromise, which creates between the author and readers - and in their 'chemical response'.
In the evening concluded a Spanish poet, Luis García Montero, whose speech also placed the emphasis on this' fingers into the writer zavázaného writer '.
He said that, in the world who live in haste, also in intellectual habits and the control of consciousness, which it dogmatismy, forgotten that, 'that behind every přitakáním lies small not and for every by denying it is also small yes'.
'to be masters of our ideas and reality, we must přibarvovat: and přibarvovat means very much to put a finger in the wounds and bother those individuals who are much more convenient, because they think in karikaturách, černobíle in fixed ideas and without colouring, and bother also authority, which show that this black and white world', made to support the sense of writing.
Romano for my first title
Rubén Omar Romano, three defeat in the final, during the careers of experienced both good and bad, but have already managed to achieve on three occasions in a series of crucial.
In duelu Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, besides střetnou two different styles of with its techniques teams that have real difference between us in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano, three defeat in the final, during the careers of experienced both good and bad, but managed to achieve on three occasions in a series of crucial, but until now go away with this impression nepořízenou, and that is why this is an extraordinary opportunity for him.
Argentinec had to contend with a silver medals, remained step for the winners, and curiously played with the same team the following final.
Santistický strategy as coach came into my first final apertura tournament in 2002, when in the hands of the reins morelia club, with which to the overall 4-2 against toluce; then again clausura tournament in 2003 to advance into the decisive duelu and it also lost with the overall score 3-1, which was against the team rayados.
Already with the club Laguna Santos in tournament torneo bicentenario 2010, once again against the 'ďáblům' from toluky, rubén once again suffered defeat, although his team has played against 'uzenářům' (another přezdívka club deportivo toluca - massive fly-tipping.) After 210 minutes games nerozhodně 2-2, after a series of criminal shooting into the advantages of three to one, and had two opportunities zpečetit title, but at the end of his three players from 11 flown past our action and team so suffered turnover on 4-3.
Rubén already lost two final against 'red ďáblům' from toluky and one against the Monterrey, his future rival, therefore, to avoid the same fate and the curse of, and so, for the first time to celebrate the title, although it says that it is the most important institutions.
'I want to emerge as a winner, I do not want to start statistics, this is a club for the passion, which I am obliged to, and title would be, of course, for me, but this is the first important', to express the coach, when he was asked about the figures, which are in the final against him.
In memory of the previous final has, in which confirms, many taught, 'we have taught us lessons that, as long as the ref nezapíská after, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared to take action, as well as the players, because the last two penaltami, we have already been prepared vyběhnout celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned, will not end until struggle, we cannot celebrate'.
It is not a concern that this series of could decide in criminal stříleních, believes its players: 'never nesnažíte happen to a series of criminal kopů, try to end in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option, and is needed for this to be prepared, in the last tournament were, unfortunately, we are ready to us but the fate of přichystal bad move, perhaps because of nervům or anxiety that we felt when he was the title in our hands, but we have lost it, that in the US something left, and let us hope that, this time, there will be no such thing'.
Romano has in its hands the chance to stop being the second and a taste for the first time glory, which bring degrees.

Therefore, spoke about the fact that there is a need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridge, which would bring the ruling forward in order.

The new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement on the possible creation of a permanent troops for the fight against corruption and koluzi, many observers continue to calls for the creation of a public inquiry into the Commission on this issue.
Minister for public security, Robert dutil, seeks to ensure that this idea nezapadla into oblivion: Québec intends to with the department of investigation from New York prokonzultovat this issue back in January of next year.
Cities are available to the permanent anti-corruption unit has since 1870.
Therefore úterní announcement many of us by surprise.
It should be noted that in the meeting of the permanent Council for the police service in quebeku on 29 October of last year, this was not discussed measures, even though that was present, Robert dutil.
More, it was not necessary to critic of public security, straník PQ Stéphane bergeron, evaluate this announcement as' králíka vytaženého out of a hat 'and' amateur solution zfušované on koleně '.
The Minister himself dutil reply to those who fear that political power is too great an influence on possible future unity.
'content with the confirmation of the: you will see the outcome when it oznámíme.'
'We are aware of this problem'.
For President csq, réjeana parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of interrogation witnesses in the public trials.
'in addition Mr charest reinforced in the fact that it does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think as you and I, something that is' explains.
'the only means of how to achieve the creation of a Commission of Inquiry, is the demise of Jean charesta', explains the on the matter Yves boisvert, a professor of ethics and in a constitution for the training of senior officials.
To be able to come out of this impasse, proposed quebeku to grant special authorise the supervisor, in order to be able to investigate koluzi and corruption.
'We must be able to extend the mandate of the Supervisor' decided.
It is also for that Quebec could give Supervisor the same powers as Commissioner, which enable us to force people to svědčili.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the dossier charestovy governments.
Quebec would also after ottawě to change the criminal code, so as to be better primed for this type of crime.
This requirement would be departed from the representative for the operation marteau (a hammer), which referred to the Minister of Justice jean-marca fourniera that case-law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for public security, vic toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, rob Nicholson, has just deals with some of the amendments relating to this document.

Dupont is partly blamoval
Quebecký rozhlasový moderátor Stéphane Dupont is the partial failure suffered from the Canadian Council for the standards of radio and television broadcasting (rrtv) due to the controversial statements concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as because of the gross expression during the broadcasting.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting thinks that Mr Dupont is and his group from Choi 98,1 FM should also have the right to express their views, but some statements included 'inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portray Haitians gross expression, which does not correspond to the broadcasting vysílanému during the day'.
The Council also concluded that the discussion on the suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of two people, which took the lives of, neporušily regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting has received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasting, posted between the years 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after complaints common front beneficiaries of social support quebeku.
Group complained that the sums referred to in the broadcasting, were inaccurate.
Hosts must submit a reliable information, not deceptive.
As regards the suicide moderátor Stéphane Dupont is thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that transmitted by the report was such that suicide cannot be regarded as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
'The Commission considers that the most contentious episodes of broadcasting' dupontových poledních reports' hit on the delicate subject of an impartial and appropriate manner. '
Not against him raised no accusation.
The latest dispute about the statement which has ensued after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont is jean-rené dufort and is therefore in media incidents, which has caused many responses.
Moderátor Choi said that did not send any gift to the aid of the Haitians because we cannot know with certainty that really needed the money they receive.
The Commission considers that these comments are not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates the unduly negative image of the Haitians.
'I have already odčinil my a three-day delay the matter'.
'My underlying dossier is intact for one and a half year', said moderátor.
In all the decisions the Commission refuses to use in broadcasting gross expression.
In any case, the radio broadcasts choi-fm cooperate 'beyond their obligations'.
For the station, which will have to, among other things, to announce this decision once in the course of the broadcasting within three days, the consequences are minimal.

450 nasmlouvaných million without public tenders
Hydro-québec passed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with firms providing engineering on hydroelektrický eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is precisely the consortium generated from firms bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor, which received the most important contract, contract on the management of the entire project in total 295 million dollars without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of the énergie gérance was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the choice of society hydro-québec to svěřilo in the private sector its responsibility for the management of this significant hydroelektrického project in the value of $5 billion.
At the beginning of the year 2005 the consortium 'énergie gérance' acquired a lucrative contract without any declaration of public competition.
For quebeckou side of the complaint to a consortium of businesses from presents us with a serious problem of an ethical nature, which risks of exclusion of competition and cause of rising prices.
'It is a new way to implement koluzi and destroy competition'.
', this means that people no longer ulterior agreements do not secretly, today it is already doing openly', said yesterday Member PQ Sylvain simard at the press conference.
A little earlier this morning, M. simard asked this question of the National Assembly, because it says that badly, how can be sold to the public interest in this way.
The Minister for natural resources, Nathalie normandeau, afternoon argue strongly popírajíc, that this would be for this contract on koluzi.
'I have their own way' hromovala and argued that PQ was' dishonest 'and' lacked the accuracy of '.
She said that 'it would be the smallest' that would be PQ unwell.
A recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or a few businesses tie their mutual expertisy, so that they can respond to the call for the submission of offers on the comprehensive project.
Eastmain project is a very complex with regard to obsáhlost work.
The construction of already is expiring and must be rozvržena until 2012.
However, the Treaty has been accorded, without competition could act; it was trade.
It must also be acknowledged that formulka konsorcií is no longer in quebeku exception, and even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le devoir, formulka konsorcií in the area of advice in engineeringu is the subject of investigations in the government.
Přelétneme-li speed in the commercial register quebeckých firms, this will allow us to discover more than 200 konsorcií, with some seem to be created by their permanent.
This company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of their main competitors; Cima + name génivar, snc-lavalin and Roche and tecsult.
Any combination of, and there are dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is the Dessau.
As regards the consortium énergie gérance normandeauová, the Minister has highlighted, in particular, the fact that the 'territory la Baie James is typical of the special dynamism of the labor force and that hydro-québec has responded to since the 1970's'.
The main patron eastmain project, réal laporte, from energy companies Baie James (sebj) has given us an explanation, which will force svraštit front over the fact that the Treaty on the management of the project was closed by mutual agreement.
'If jdeš into the public competition and if it is little participants competition podávajících offer your offered by prices may be higher.'
'You have on the choice of two possibilities: i.e. that sebereš people who are in the tender as participants in the competition, and that řekneš:' Let us to conclude an agreement satisfactory and with good price '.
'but the main idea is that important is not the price, but the competences of the people', confirmed Mr laporte.
This Treaty granted to a consortium of énergie gérance is part of a long list of the Treaties for more than 50 000 $, which have received quebeku party.
Contracts were concluded with the company hydro-québec or sebj project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After verification of Le devoir 109 contracts can count on advice in the field of engineeringu concluded between the year 2002 and March 2010, with firms or their branches, especially with laboratořemi, provádějícími analysis of samples of land.
Snc-lavalin shrábl 22 contracts, for this génivar of them received 14 and 16, tecsult Dessau 10 without should share in the 'énergie gérance'.
All contracts were concluded.
Together account for 449 783 344 $, including contract companies énergie gérance on 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain simard indicated that the four companies, which are part of the consortium (bpr, Dessau, Groupe sm and axor) are 'very good acquaintances Liberal Party quebeku'.
Minister normandeauová delete the report that PQ is also linked to the firms that it 'Fund', before specify that is rather about its governing workers.
The barometer of responsible consumption - the 'green' on the label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
Very few players quebecký consumer trust, sustainable development, but also the 'fair' marks and environmental certification to obey accordingly in the choice of products.
The worst thing is that, even though the koupeme in the media space, which urges and urges us to a socially responsible consumption, cries this media space over the lack of credible information, non-compliance with obligations, which qualifies as a brake on even for their commitment, says baromètre responsible consumption, whose first rule out yesterday.
Even if in the year 2010 increased consumption of so-called socially responsible quebeku products, the people who are trying to sell them is still too believes
Two thirds of us actually say that does not believe the promises of firms, relating to the environment, simply because the Green advertising companies, finds measuring instrument, which has produced a Observatory responsible consumption of universities in sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of all consumers has doubts about the credibility of the official certification, přikládaných on so-called fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands, which are described as ecologically responsible States barometre.
In the same way, the politicians and the debate on this topic is taken as a serious only 14.6% of the population quebeku.
Information on the responsible consumption, however, seems to be the overriding for stimulating this site consumption as well as renewed currently almost one third of the quebeckých consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious character of information would make the enthusiasm of the 46% of consumers.
This is the second a brake, which identified baromètre, after the higher prices for these products.
After all, a third of the population of quebekuse puts nedůvěřivě against the reported data on products or 'green' services, which we are looking for is to be left to go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010 was almost half of all consumers willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the designation of one or a few products, thereby responding to their convictions.
Entire 61% of them has purchases for traders from their district and prefer the purchase of food, vypěstovaných in their region, baromètre says.
More 'green' and responsible - the index of the responsible consumption achieved 64 of maximum 100 for this year - homo consumus québeku, I presented as the King of recycling, which seeks to what the lowest possible impact on the environment that is concerned about the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remains somewhere outside their vehicle baromètre States: in the year 2010, barely 28% of the population quebeku said that use public transport or that recommend the use of cars to train at least two persons, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walking and cycling also supported on 39,1% of the participants of the large-scale survey behaviour, who used this rhetoric.
Loan state on buying up complex country excentris
The government quebeku, which we have asked for financial participation in buying up complex country excentris companies Angus et Le parallèle, agrees with spoluúčastí, but only in the amount of the loans.
Developperská society 'Angus et Le parallèle', which sought to a gift of EUR seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture on buying up cinematic complex in the tabloid press saint-laurenta and which has shown its mission as milovníka film art, received what has requested.
The government's acceptance of the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under their own conditions.
Rather than anticipated gift quebeku Government is proposing a loan, which, after all, would be lower, some was the original expectations, which could take the basis for a viable solution for the advantageous conditions and resources derived from the state.
The first action plan and the requirement to 12.8 million has already been rejected Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the plan of action by Minister st-pierre President society for the development of entrepreneurship in culture (sodec), François macerola, who directs the kinematografický excentris project.
The final report was sent to the ten days ago.
But protinávrh government came into society sodec on Tuesday.
Le parallèle et Angus have time until 31 December on that one.
However, it appears that hypothesis gift was made from the state really must be rejected.
Let us remember that, associations of country and kinematografických centres in quebeku with direct investment was set against the state, in order to promote buying up excentrisu usuzujíc, that the Minister of Culture has to finance the project concerning real estate, although it has done for other kinosály.
But some of the participants in the debate, on the contrary, dožadovalo fundamental economic support.
Daniel Langlois, owner, got into the scope of their country during the ten years with the arts, having itself financed by the construction of complex, which could be the reason for the revision of the financial Council of State.
The lack of room for independent films is the more strident in montréalu and excentris, was to obtain a permanent clientele.
Society Angus et Le parallèle with christianem yaccarini in my head, governed by the campaign for the release of funds in the private sector, in the belief that utrží $700 000 for protlačení acquisitions.
Since spring 2009, one of the three film companies, Le parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for excentris.
The aim is to open up future nabyvatelů again all three rooms on 27 February of next year and the most beautiful project film xaviera beauvois men and bohové.
But the Christian yaccarini not made any reference to Le devoir and so ignores, so he has my group thinks about the proposals on reducing the, which are being made to him.
Zvednutá curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American strands of the known through the WikiLeaks reveal what the United States consider inferiority complex Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans, but the same whiplash reveal their sense of superiority of the latter appointed to Canada.
American diplomats, therefore, that every kanadskému voters lies at the heart of the kanadsko-americké relations, when it comes to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit to help the Conservative Government to was adopted its budget in 2009!
Four new reports which were American ambasádou in ottawě and Washington, yesterday an outright to show the public, provide sensitive details, moreover, to give each other 'under the skin'.
The communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, says in detail at what point the United States are not part of the betting, which discussed the political leaders.
To the great surprise us ambassador in ottawě, David wilkinse.
Mr Wilkins provides for this situation a few explanations.
'The Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý, linking perhaps political leaders to talk about internal bet, rather than to realise that these elections are also relevant to the United States (as in the campaign for free trade in 1988) ', writes.
'The United States are therefore' closed 'příslovečným slonem in these elections: the omnipresent, but potentially too threatening, than to talk about them'.
Ambassador understands this' ohlušujícímu silence 'on less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
'It is logical that the capacity of the candidate, party or, better still, party leader to manage these important relations should be the key factor which voters have in mind when they go to the elections'.
Another expression of this sense of importance can read in the report, which sent on 22 January 2009, Terry breese charge d'Affaires in ottawě at Ottawa preparing President Barack Obama on his first visit ottawy.
'your way will help to ensure that the government in a confidence vote at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly admit its first deficit for more than ten years, owing to the recovery plan of EUR 30 billion to $40 billion', writes M. breese.
Nowhere nor the reference to the fact that the government has had to shelve pre-Christmas session of the Parliament to be slaughtered coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed Ambassador wilkinsem raises Washington on the increasingly more negative image which the United States cast a dramatic series posted on the CBC.
Ambassador is concerned about the BMW broadcasts, little mosque he the prairie, intelligence and H2O in which can be seen not too much subtlety of his references to Maher Arar, 'no-fly-list' or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent hearings with the CIA.
The other report referuje that in their first bilateral meetings Hillary Clinton to ask his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is prepared to accept some of the prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner reply yes, but on the basis of the principle of 'case-by-case'.
At the end of the meeting, writes here, 'to a paper concerning Omar Khadr, 15-letého muslima Canadian origin, State Secretary.'
'Secretary adopted, with the result that the component'.
Poznamenejme, finally, that the people concerned WikiLeaks, our palms.
This flanagan, a former advisor to very close stephenu harperovi said to waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive brain should be 'destroyed'.
Rozhlásilo doslechl it and discuss it and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The world's plan for the reconstruction of lighting
The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancun plan for the reconstruction of domestic lighting, lighting shops and industrial area in 100 countries with a view to limiting the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to the almost one third of further restrictions, which is needed for stabilising the climate of the planet from now until the year 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of large specific projects, which wants to push through the UN in Cancun, difficult to offset the absence of viable commitments to reduce on the side of the industrialised countries.
According to yesterday by the plan, if rozžhavené light bulbs, monopolize which even 50 to 70% of the market, replacing žárovkami fluokompaktními or, even better, žárovkami with elektroluminiscentními diodami (del or 'ice' in English), substantial amounts from 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) GES emissions on the planet incurred because of lighting, odbouralo.
Lighting accounts for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen, in the last year, the large countries with a significant proportion of emissions as the United States, China, Europe, and another, between them, Canada, involved in the voluntary reduction plans, which should enable the decline in global emissions GES from 53 GT to 49 GT.
But it will be necessary to deduct from this balance even 5 Gt, to be achieved by 2020 the stabilisation of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude the possibility that we will not get out of control.
In rozžhavených žárovkách 95% of energy to rest in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of a light.
With fluokompaktními žárovkami, reduces energy consumption by 75%, and with new žárovkami with del, zredukujeme this consumption even twice.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs will survive in the average from 6,000 to 10 000 hours.
The new light bulbs with del, such that said this week in the production of Philips - this society is supposedly took part on a study of the UN - have finds the lifespan of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than rozžhavená light bulb, which gives us an idea of the possible savings with a plan of compensation, which would aplikoval in 100 countries.

The case of Clotilde Reiss: elysejský palace přeháněl mediation Syria
During more than ten months since July 2009 in May 2010, deal klotildy reissové, young women researchers arrested in Iran because of the 'špionáži' United views in France, said diplomacy in the battle of on-call time and emphasise the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through the WikiLeaks and konzultované with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
Describe how elysejský palace explain its strategy for the Americans, and went so far that they gave the Council, how to deal with such cases of the hostages in Iran (a small group of výletníků).
Show how the French leaders try to convince the Washington that the release of young women have been compensation against release on freedom majida kakavanda, the Iranians conditions under which in France and hledaného American judiciary for illicit trafficking in material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, comply with sharp světlu how the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to akreditovali idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, has played a central role in the liberation of klotildy reissové.
In fact, for it has not done anything.
Diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: 'Iran: the French comments to the kind of solution in the case of the hostages'.
Advisers from the Élysée Palace on strategic issues, François richier, aided by the director of the Quai d'Orsay will put them right for Northern afrikua Middle East, Patrice paoli, talks with the representative of the American diplomacy allegrone.
Explain him French method.
I recommend the Americans to do this as much for that was dopraven back into the country of its own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
'Do noise', they say, 'constantly strongly vyslovujte' in the media the words' fundamental rights of man ',' innocence ',' immediate freeing '.
It is necessary to bring into the distress of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
This' do more, the more you will ask you to stop '.
Because attempts were made on the negotiations through diskrétních channels' silence will solve nothing ', the Iranians are the masters' on the evasive manoeuvres'.
Mr richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners is' Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of 'political blackmail'.
Announces that liberation klotildy reissové (which happens on 16 August, on the day when it will provide refuge the French Embassy) 'will require paying the high financial sums of the Iranians' (kauce 230 000 euros).
And announce that elysejský palace anticipuje cases of hostages, a phenomenon which 'will be vyostřovat'.
The Iranians' could, in the future, to arrest the other around 1800 French people living in Iran '.
On 28 August 2009.
Klotilda reissová abandoned prison for 12 days, but it still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: rather, Majid kakavand on which the United States claim that was deported to the illegal trade in electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is in Paris released on the basis of the decision of the judge.
The American embassy, as well as many observers dotazuje on this worrying agreement.
In Washington, which persecutes illegal Iranian network to obtaining materials destined for the nuclear programme, is the extension of majida khakavanda bad news.
France has started on the bargaining?
The liberation of Iranians for the liberation of young women?
In the next interview with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François richier reassuring, that is not the case.
Elysejský palace, as it says, was only 'shocked by this decision of the judges', but finding option, as opposed to that.
'held talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice' (at that time, Michele Alliot-Marie,), but 'the French Government cannot alter the decisions of the Court' notes.
Mr richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid kakavand is under 'limited' supervision of the French intelligence services.
An adviser to the Élysée Palace vytáčí telephone number zavěšuje telephone handset and then informs us diplomatku that Iranian man is currently in Paris's buildings administered by the Iranian embassy '.
At a time of imprisonment klotildy reissové elysejský palace in Iran is making efforts, it is under negotiation, through communiqués and organised 'fraud' in the media, to persuade that Syria's President Bachar Al-Assad plays' significant 'and' a powerful 'role of facilitator' '.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and with some justice, that manipulation bears fruit, because a number of articles in the press reflects the French official version.
Telegram on 25 August 2009 evokes media 'blest' French official officials'.
What is based on such a degree of 'gratitude' vyjadřovaná against M. assadovi, asking the embassy in Paris.
'despite their statements full chvalořečí French official officials in the privacy of the recognise that have only vague idea about what the Syrians in fact made'.
The document is then deals with the reasons which have forced the elysejský palace pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication 'towards the validation of policies of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria' analyses.
The policy applied in 2008 'was a dose-dependent many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and nezasloužená'.
Thus, 'How of exaggeration Syrian role' Paris trying to 'to demonstrate Syria, what chvalořeči can vysloužit when it plays a constructive role in the area of'.
The aim is also to spread the wheat 'nesváru between Syria and Iran'.
The American Embassy knows this, from the very good resources.
On 11 August, François richier entrusted to him: ', of course, we do not know whether the Syrians do something, whether it is anything'
'but yet we thank them.'
'this should at least bring chaos and confusion between the Iranians'.
Klotilda reissová back in France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy it adopts in the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their 'active role in favour of the liberation of our krajanky'.
The end of the online games after midnight for young Koreans
South Korean Government will adopt the law entitled 'peciválský', which will prohibit adolescentům play online games after midnight, that block access to them, said responsible government officials.
The draft law will be presented to Parliament in December, in order to be able to ask the companies providing online games on the block access to these Games after midnight persons under 16 years, said officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
'many children plays these games the whole night and have then with learning difficulties in school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day'.
'We consider that this law is essential for it to be ensured their health and their right to sleeping', said for AFP Jo rin, leading actor on the ministry, who is in charge of the bill.
Online games will newly accessible from 6 o'clock in the morning.
Society will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, his accusation.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to reduce daily time access to these games for young people, whose parents request it, added responsible worker.
It also made available to the people who request it, programmes free of charge, to reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by 'and' the daily press brings regularly different facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champion in world championships in online games.
In November of South Korea received four gold medals on cyber world games, and that in the face of the 58 other peoples.
The World Cup in years 2018-2022: FIFA establishes the host country.
The full unrest owing to the suspicions of corruption establishes the Executive Committee of the FIFA on Thursday of the host country of the World Cup in the years 2018 and 2022, the selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk that are overtaken by the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, Royal competition FIFA in the year 2018se will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, španělsko-portugalsko, nizozemí-belgie).
The football in the year 2022 will be much exotičtější, while the International Federation hopes that it will conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its opening night on the African continent in 2010, or to continue in the insertion in the United States or to the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities, which they participate in the framework of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince from Qatar, the head of government officials, Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
The negotiations in the backrooms faces the risk of that will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of according to the candidates.
According to the assessment report FIFA documentation, the English, španělsko-portugalská (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation their competitors.
But these reasons do not have too much weight for 22 members of the executive of the Commission in an hour for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspendování two members of the CE mark / European Commission? / for corruption (reynald temarii et Amos Adam) may destroy chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the world šampionát only once in the year.
The BBC in Monday deploying all, when broadcast a document which 'napíchl on špendlík' three influential members of the CE mark (the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas leoz and Issa hayatou.
How to make FIFA nespokojenou and bring into difficulty English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The President of the government hopes that he will be able to move that povedl his predecessor in office, Tony Blair, which in 2005 have managed to gain for London the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
It will be enough this intense activity to a new trappings of England to add the name on the CE mark (the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less a because the twin španělsko-portugalsko includes trump cards already prepared stadiums, his bill (world šampionát in 1982, in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona 1992 euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But grim economic and financial perspective of both countries could give these ambitions cold sprchu.
When the retaliatory measures against angličanům and doubts about the payment of the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's position, which was an outsider, despite the gaps in his documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir poutin decided that the nepřemístí into curichu and publicly declared 'unfair competition in the preparation of the vote', in word narážkách hardly pokroucených in the English press charges against members of the CE mark (the European Commission).
'we throw them blátem, we are going to try to is zkompromitovat', said Mr poutin.
For the year 2022 appear to be a logical a favourite in the United States, with its considerable experience of 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the major sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has a great ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately, vyhotovily beautiful project.
But these candidacy appear to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 experienced 'test'.
Another threat: the granting of the World Cup 2026 China, which has horoucně wishes FIFA, made the Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With katarem that out in the form of his great ESO futuristických stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into the new krajin, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pykat for poor charges TV (because of time shift) paid by European countries, as a driving force for the FIFA.
The second mandate: zřejmost (certainty)
De Gaulle really váhal.
Mitterrand has given the impression that it is.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate elysejskému palace calling somebody else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is not in line with the good of secrecy associated with the current functions.
It is, therefore, do we need to do, as it would doubt the continuation of constantly.
In one, and in the second sense.
In 2006, without it wanted to believe, Jacques Chirac friends to make claims that third mandate has not been ruled out.
On 15 November with serious an expression of Nicolas Sarkozy assured that 'decides sometimes in the autumn of 2011'.
As before the Members of Parliament of the UMP Wednesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of the 'two mandates' zasela little horečný situation.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not since this far.
President only remind you that a revision of the Constitution in 2008 restricted the number of years of functional period to two.
It was from his party only noting no announcement.
This is not the first time that resembles in such meetings humorným tone of the presidential elections.
'in the worst case, or in the best case, before you even seven and a half year', observed with me in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: 'do not think that neuvažuji on the next stage of'.
His předvčerejší statements do not do it candidate more than the previous day; do not make him a candidate or less.
If we give the comments, it is because of the dual truth.
Speeding up the way to the candidacy of Iran to the PA, on the one hand.
But this is not entry to ring ségolèna royala what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy, to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is, therefore, that his candidacy in 2012, it is obvious that many in the PA want arrangements to combat assemblies rather premature than intended.
Bad survey on the other.
Firstly, the electorate right would prefer candidacy François Fillon, before candidacy Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against the 44%, according to the bva-l 'express).
'We have candidate and we are not discussing the issue with the UMP' reacted immediately and prudent way people from the nearest surroundings of the Prime Minister.
'if they believe possible defeat, will not stand' tells you Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
'will still believe that can win' repairs Alain Juppé, balanced, zřejmostí.
The euro: the European Central Bank to continue in their purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the central in the year should be an opportunity to clarifying conditions to get out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of a large number of unusual operations monetary policy, which must be brought to a conclusion by the end of this year.
The crisis sovereign European claims obliges the, the Institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly be able to afford to be so insistent under the threat of a deterioration in the situation today already strained on the European markets with securities.
The political price would in that case was about this higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of a solution to the crisis of claims of European states.
It did not want to say whether it thinks that the Bank could do more, by, for example, that would increase its programme for the purchase of sovereign bonds.
'I reserve my account for my European partners (...) '.
The evening before that, in Brussels, in his interrogation by the Commission for the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed výřečnější as if it is about his intentions and spokojil that said that the programme of the purchase of state-owned newspapers on the secondary market 'continues' and that 'we will see how we will decide' during the sitting, which is taking place this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will keep a sharp eye on its fundamental fixed rate of interest at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the bond purchases from the coffers of the Central European Bank carried out in the last week, doubled to almost 1,35 billion euros.
And, thanks to the nerozumnosti dohodců on the market has made yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem, bought for EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Between dohodci on market anticipace bar any doubts about the continuation of purchases (see party 29).
Neither the economists expect no significant change in the exchange rate.
If operations loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, is this the latter to designate the Bank to an unlimited provision of liquid funds under the generous conditions and on the duration of the period from one week in three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
'I cannot imagine that it would have changed significantly its programme'.
"If not, this would mean to take the risk of causing a short-term new tensions', it says, the economist Michael schubert Commerzbank.
'progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems likely' pre-empts Norbert bräms, an economist at sal.
Oppenheim.
The plan to its intervention in the market with public debt, 'would have to the European Central Bank to maintain the volume of buying their bonds to revive its poor market', compounded by Norbert bräms.
With regard to the exposure of the European banks on the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area has no further on the choice of nothing else than to maintain its presence on the market.
'needs at any price to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the outbreak of well-paid accomplishments States patřícími among the most fragile' testify yesterday important manager of bonds.
Because if interest rates vzlétly will States on more agony to redukovaly their debt, instead of to be stabilised.
This is saving the euro for this price.

'The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, it is not as Greece or Ireland'.

The latest forecasts Brussels were for the government of cold shower.
From now on, the Italian growth is expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget that is available to the Senate on his analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission will kalkuluje public deficit represent even 4.3% of gross domestic product in the next year (against 3.9% of the anticipated the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new body supplements to the proposal of the state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.

The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December will be Silvio Berlusconi to face up to the proposal on the censure of the House and, subsequently, following this could start to organise elections, which envisaged at the end of March.
Has this period, little suitable for the adoption of a decision in the case of serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde it yesterday to stress once again in the framework of the press conference in Paris: 'I think that Europeans this demonstrated on Sunday in the course of the day and night, are obviously very sympathetic determined, committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone'.
Although everything is relative, yesterday's noted expansion, concerning the interest on the European government bonds, has brought the water in the hands of the governments and the European Central Bank.

Metro grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since it is the discussion on the modernisation of transport on Ile-de-France in full swing, prší billion.
At least during the debate.
We particularly 23 billion for the grand Paris metro, which is to build a society Société du Grand Paris.
To ensure that this House could be launched, announced by the state to provide subsidies amounting to EUR 4 billion.
This is purely theoretical amount, which then enable companies to use the SGP on procurement part of the funding from its double the resources.
Today we finally come to the amendments from the first.
Rektifikační law on the finances of the year 2010, which examines the financial Committee of the national assembly of this morning, contains mechanisms set out to ensure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and increase taxes from the offices to Ile-de-France.
First, we in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is' in favour of public institutions Société du Grand Paris'.
It is ascertained: 'the revenue from this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the rates for office, which already exists, therefore, 'to be modernised, to increase revenue gained from it and that this increase affect society Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it brought?
A pipe dream.
This is not vyčísleno in the text.
We have far into the 4 billion.
'It is clarified that these fiscal resources are adding to EUR 4 billion of capital subsidies, which will be mobilised state and put into society Société du Grand Paris according to the', we can read in the explanation of reasons.
In the society of the SGP this system does not seem quite shocking.
'from the time when we have created the revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study after a period of three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, explains here'.
'It will be incorporated into the budget and used according to the needs of the'.
Society SGP has for that 4 billion will be připsány until 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, in which 4 promised billion is still nepřítomným abonentům risks that will give rise to rather a lot of parliamentary debate.
The first public sitting will be organised on 7 December.
Mstiví hackers and přičinliví vyzvědači
The case of the Wikileaks has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, it has been obvious scandal, a scandal, which seems to be a scandal in the face of hypocrisy governing relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it says everything about the deep changes at international level, and anticipating the future Shia-dominated regression.
But let us move popořádku.
The first aspect WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document drawn up by secret service (any nation) consists exclusively from the press cuts.
'extraordinary revelations about the way the Americans' sex life Berlusconi is announcing that what has been going on for months everyone can read in the newspapers kterýchkoliv (all in addition to these two Berlusconi own), and the notorious karikaturní profile kadáfího was already long for kabaretní artists device for skeče.
Rule according to which a secret documents may consist only of the reports already known, it is crucial in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go into a bookshop, which devotes ezoterické literature, you will see that every piece of work repeats (graalu, záhadě rennes-le-château, templářích or zednářích) exactly what has been written in the previous components.
And this is not only because of the texts that the author occult pátrá not after the new information (or do not know where to find the report on non-existent), but because those who are engaged in okultismu believe just do what they know, and what this confirms what previously learned.
This is a mechanism for the success of the Dan Brown.
The same is true for confidential documents.
Informátor is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret services (and if it is not, it may be, as I know redaktorem in a newspaper Libération), which considers true only what he himself admits.
Information with high confidentiality of Berlusconi, which the US embassy sent a portfolio, which were the same Newsweek by a week before.
So why around the revelations of these documents so much fuss likely?
On the one hand, say what every kultivovaný one already knows, and that is that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and, since they can heads of state telephone calls or fly out aeroplane on common dinner, lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercise in the representation of the parties transformed spy in the centre.
Any observer of monitoring the films on the investigation into the knows very well that only from licoměrnosti this seemingly ignores.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly, have vilified duty hypocrisy and casts a bad light on the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any an individual hacker can obtain nejpřísněji sensitive information the most powerful country in the world is a harsh blow, not significant, for the prestige of the public sector.
The scandal affects both the victims and his' executors of '.
But let us move on from here to the profound truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell's, it was possible to deal with all the power, as some big brother, who control the every movement of their people.
It has been proven orvellovo prophecy since thanks to the opportunities to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every carried out by the transaction, navštívený hotel, which the motorway, and so on and so forth, became a citizen of the absolute victims věnce power.
But when demonstrujeme, as what is happening now that even 'of' with nejtajnějšími information powerful cannot resist intervention some hackera, ceases to be a one-way street and the screening report becomes oběžníkem.
The power of the controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least an individual hacker - elected as mstitel citizen - can know all the secrecy of power.
How can maintain power, which already has the opportunity to maintain their own secrecy?
It is true that already Georg simmel said, that the real secrecy is bezobsažné secrecy (and bezobsažné secrecy will never be discovered); it is also true that all the information on the nature of Berlusconi, or Merkel is really tajemným bezobsažným secret, because it is vytaženo from public life; but to discover, as it did WikiLeaks that secrecy Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými secrecy, means odnímat him all the power.
Wikileaks has not done any mistake for Sarkozy or Merkel, but something has carried out a great deal of Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this the wounds inflicted powers so important?
It is obvious that, in the future, States will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be tantamount to its publication on the poster vylepeném on the Horn of Africa street.
But it is also perfectly clear that the current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that can be maintained in the secrecy of the report after the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out whether and when the head of state traveling aeroplane and brought together with some of my colleagues.
How will be able to be maintained in the future in the secrecy of private and sensitive report?
I am well aware that for the moment my prediction belongs to the science fiction, and so it is a fantastic, but I imagine, government officials who are transported discreetly the formalities for uncontrolled routes and wear in themselves only those reports, which know by heart, or rather shelter precious information in podpatku shoes.
Information will be retained in the unikátních copies in zásuvkách closed key: in summary, an attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair should less success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, this means alone run backwards.
A century later, when the wireless telegraf mean revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitoval telegraf based on drátech (telephone).
Videokazety (analogové) allow milovníkům cinemas take film step by step, move it forward and backward and identify all the secrecy montáže, whereas now, CDS (číslicové) allow only skákat after chapters, this means after makroporcích.
Through rychlovlaků dojedeme from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the road and air transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that the policy of and communication technology will return to cars behind horses.
The last point.
Sometimes, the press tried to understand what the zosnovalo in secret Embassy.
It is now the embassy, which are asking for confidential information from the press.
The climate: how France hackla its promises on the funding
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to try to respect the promises to rapidly odblokovaná funding (řečená funding with the rapid start (fast start) or premature), followed by developed countries.
And the French hacky revealed
In the Copenhagen agreement with the advanced countries committed to provide $30 billion in the years 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion to three years and France 1,26 billion (that is to say EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the EU has pulled COP16 large ESO to persuade its partners on the feasibility of its commitment concerning the financing of fast start: the report upřesňující action of its Member States, the press conference, grand side event, the distribution of brožurek...
Transparent operations nedocenitelná and oceněná on their real value: the developed countries and civil society would like to them all the developed countries and civil society, the same way and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010, to release EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it on the right path to adhere to its promise 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are according to the Copenhagen agreement 'new and additional', to ensure that it is implemented without increased burden would be to the detriment of public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what is meant by 'a new and additional'.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, among other things, France, the process of blocked.
Today everyone selects here a reference, which fits him best.
The European Commission, for example, was deemed a reference year 2009: the international financing, and she has behaved in it even adds 150 million for three years in the financing of fast start.
Other countries choose similar do with annual payment deadlines or with the dates of the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France has for the fact that the financing of 'all new projects' 2010 are 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no character reference to the spending of the previous period or to the global level of public aid for the development of the D 'aide publique au Développement.
Specifically, the total amount of support for France to developing countries can remain constant (or even reduce), it has to keep to its commitment concerning the financing of the 'new and additional'...
Another crucial element is the division on gifts and loans.
There is no rule and everyone selects its own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, they think that 1 €půjčené equal 1 €do not look gift.
Obviously, it is difficult to verifiable: effort is not přirovnatelná.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments, which are cost-effective (often regards projects relating to reducing emissions, of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one of the euro, which we, as the equivalent of one euro, which we are giving..., we should not see it on account of their commitments, but as the price of loans for the creditor country (i.e., the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can give just such a recital: 'respects' its commitment of EUR 420 million euros, is doing 91,5% loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36,1 million euros) - see the document of the EU, to think that they can be verified.
It is only the countries of the Union, which in such a scale uses the loan.
Germany has cost from 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) comply with their obligations to 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union can €1 in the framework of the satisfaction on his promise, France can only 10 centimů and considers this desire for comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský piece of!
For the summary in its financing for the 'fast start' France operate with dual šejdířstvím: on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other hand, with the real financial burden.
Although spends only 36,1 million euros, will be able to persuade that spends EUR 420 million 'new and additional' in the context of its promises.
Manipulation finance minister (because it seems to me that, although this is Bercy who was such a decision) could have double negative impact, at the same time, within the EU (why should the Member States to continue the donation, when we need only to lend?) and in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely naïve...
The chapter of the early funding is only a small otázečkou, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of discussions about the climate.
But could be zrnkem sand, moreover, in a huge machine which is UNFCCC.
Let us hope that it will not be our case.
Whether it be anything, it is necessary to draw the findings of this first year early financing.
First of all, should France to announce a change in our way of leadership of the accounting records for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for their commitments and fairness and justice for the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France should prevent discussion about savings into the long-term funding (other essential chapter is currently under discussion): an issue of 'dodatečnosti' or about the way zaúčtování loans.
France should change its position that has become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as is the case for the other.
Therefore all hope placed in the new Minister for the environment, Mrs kosciusko-morizetové, which goes into cancunu next week.
The surprising announcement on the fast start France and its vision of 'dodatečnosti' and the use of loans could bring about an increase in the level of international confidence necessary for it to be possible to go further in the discussions.
Bell relating to pesticides, which children they have digested.
The ten-year child pozře one day 81 of different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of future generations (ex- Movement for Rights and the preservation of future generations).
The Association, which highlights that its results' have signifikantní statistical value with regard to the low number of analysed samples, but they are characteristic of zpracovávanou issue ', bought between July and September food routinely konzumované in four dishes and one easy food as a slight svačinu on one child roughly ten-year in supermarkets in L oise and in Paris.
This typical food, involving the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 per gallon of water on a daily basis - as well as sweets, were analysed research laboratořemi on chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting officials.
Balance is heartbreaking dishes: 81 chemical substances, 42, it ranks among the substances are carcinogenic, possible or likely and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as the 37 substances, which could act as a disruptive for žlázy with internal vyměšováním (PE), according to studies several institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
', even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research, well, we see that the reality in the exposure of consumers kontaminujícím substances may be exposed to carcinogenic and / or PE is striking, states' association.
To my breakfast butter and tea with milk contain themselves about ten résiduí with potentially carcinogenic effects and three identified as some carcinogens, as is the case with some twenty residues, which could distort the hormonal system.
Jablko, imported from Brazil, the studies as a small svačinka contains traces of six chemical substances, including in France banned fungicidní means.
The same is true for green fazolky from kenyi, included in their lunch, for which a study of the traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
Moreover, biftek from mletého meat, tuna in plechovce and even houska and žvýkačka were punctuated with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water analysis have revealed the presence of dusičnanů and chloroformu.
A steak of salmon for dinner was' the richest 'with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even analysis plastového dishes used to ohřátí food in mikrovlnné oven no analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this' kontaminujících substances' is probably underestimated 'results from the study.
The alliance of ecological evropa-zelení (ee-lv) proposed 'in the face of the urgent situation' to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop the 'increase in diseases of civilisation'.
In July, the study of the European agency for food safety (EFSA) has been investigating the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereáliích.
