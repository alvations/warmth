The lack of snow in the mountains haunts the hotel
The deserted do not only the giant.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have many visitors in our pages.
The people go through the offers, asking prices, but not afraid to order mandatory.
And if they call us, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal spindl. info.
Who wants to stay in the New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate more with the appointment.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, he can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel offer for the moment that stays a week for the new year.
I think that they will try to indicate a moment, but then they go and accept shorter periods.
And then the rooms free will quickly, "said Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates, a travel agency in Ingtours Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last moment, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The travel agency in giant can also offer the New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
Sold well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the clues remain snowfall during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "said Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year to fill the rooms in the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We are about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last couple of places.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the new year is also the hotel Omnia in the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half of the beds free.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, for which we have already Sixty percent of occupation at the moment.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow comes, the interest for stays in giant, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše, however, expect more snow.
On Thursday, it should cool and if there are any precipitation, they should be snow in the mountains.
But then again, informed jiří jakubský of Hradec of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
UNITED STATES: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghan question, which he regarded as the most stupid.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it turned out that it is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times the phrase "as in Iraq," he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's statement of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "A new way forward."
Was himself, who three years ago, criticized the idea of Bush to send new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the Civil War as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of the commanders, was the only possible and successful, so that today are not talking about Iraq in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improved, however, objectively speaking, he left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle.
The captains of field again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley Mccristal, even despite Subordinačním harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House.
He asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better, so at least misled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to root out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the whole strategy of Obama seems to be his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process within three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than answers.
Many doubt that the increase in half will bring the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to change the head every day, according to their needs.
The political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of the lack of the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state", which is the minimalist objective of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama's strategy perplexed by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of explosion.
Only a romantic soul, the reality, can believe that the Small Soldiers sent in the war to "return home" will cause here made a miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will be seen as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically alter the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution, however, will mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash
Senior executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year in cash.
The company announced in response to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, that they will not be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction that needs to take, said the former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the company for this year, according to the Reuters news agency, probably in spite of the measure announced today, $20 billion dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector, with the arrival of the financial crisis have become a hot political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers who exceed the 25,000 pounds (approximately 712.000 CZK) with a tax of 50%.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women won the Nobel prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
A record five women, received today in Stockholm today from the hands of the King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden this year's Nobel Prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosome.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in economics, the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only specialist category, which this year, no woman, was physics.
This prize received today scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the Certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
The amounts in each category of ten million Swedish kronor (about 25 million CZK).
If there are several winners in each category, the reward is divided between them.
The traditionally more expected, the Nobel Peace Prize has already received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US President Barack Obama.
He, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his appointment, because it is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential for peace, even if the price is high.
The minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering his stay in the government, because it does not agree with the version of the state budget for the next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the Cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepening the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting informed the Presidential Spokesman Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the Social Democrats, that they would increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute, of the question mark over the future of the Fischer bureaucratic Cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, removes the package of measures, imposed by the government of Fischer in the autumn to curb the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but that is not, said today during a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that the politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no longer a good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could rely on a broader consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is appalling and that the government should consider its future existence.
The ODS vice-president, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer in response to such words as "strong".
The head of Čssd, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolanek, and which exceeds 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: the world, much of the country, its fight and victories, despite some criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story tells of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life story of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years, asked him to embody in the film.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I will have to have access to you.
The actor Seventy-two years, who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from which became a slave, a fictional president of the US, and even God in "Evan Almighty. but rarely someone who is still alive and, for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and for four years, became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak as he
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help to unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the history of Mandela on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role, such as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world political were in the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandela to shake his hand.
I realized that when I you hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
It was a great surprise for him, when he met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I come to the door, he opened and the first thing I said to FranÃ§ois Pienaar in my life was:' In the film I look much higher ".
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their real models, and under the leadership of the Director Eastwood "Invictus: Undefeated positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for an Oscar.
The film critic of The Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, very well done film."
In the film reviews on the site rottentomatoes. com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive assessments.
The mystery of the splendour on Norway resolved: the Russians tested a missile
On Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence ended recognizing yesterday that near the Norwegian border tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch, but was unsuccessful and the missile type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence in the presence of the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, or it was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile, which do not fly."
A missile that do not fly, but shines.
This, the 13th test took place at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight that there was again damage on the apparatus.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time, and that we cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket and the accident was only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went completely without mistakes, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
The success of almost 50 percent fills the generals with optimism and therefore continue to claim that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will even to ten nuclear warheads with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed in 51 years, one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov in 51 years again in a professional hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably already in the Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career with forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly and agreed to help the team.
We only need to resolve some details on the form, the coach of the Moscow Club, quoted by the agency.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous player will be limited to one match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.

Hyundai has listened to the unions. All overtime
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the often nařizovaným overtime, the unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the car factory Hyundai confirmed.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, therefore, was designed voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The site sedmička. cz, wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
He will get people back to work Saturday, 28 November.
According to the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees in the proposed overtime.
Either they receive the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on 28 December, and thus a day to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek.
In addition, all employees of Saturday will receive compensation for the fare and lunch.
With regard to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and problematic of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped the production last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight-hour shifts.
The unions are cancel the state of strike after the signing of the agreement.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unionists is to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to cancel the strike if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document.
The situation in the car factory culminated last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 Employees spontaneously came on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The direction that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and power supply cars.
The trade unionists in his declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the production, were penalised in any way.
In the field of overtime, the unions are asking the company to reduce the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year to pay a remuneration of 5,000 crowns.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The serial production was launched in November last year.
Until September of this year produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus ""
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
This is, in some cases, the fact that the compound is not as a common variant of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
Can prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a series of side effects.
The suppression of the virus has resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called Metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The Metalokarborane are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way of all drugs used today, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, the scientists to new ´ improved ’ compounds, prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked by a metal atom, in this case the Cobalt.
A traitor and resilient virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the Division of HIV protease caused by the HIV virus would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in test, and also against their variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of the variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting compounds for further research towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over the budget. ods attacked Fischer, he defends
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think their continued existence.
The expression of the ODS described the prime minister as strong sentences.
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS-chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to nečas the prime minister must decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, which seeks to combat the growing deficit, or if it wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is a fundamentally different, warned Nečas.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion kronor.
The house has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the Social Democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government, that the amended budget is less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened with his resignation in the case of ratification of the proposals, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business with the prime minister.
He indicated at the time that he would remain in office.
The reason is his disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agree with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do with the representatives of the Čssd, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to subsidies in disease, pensions, or the reform of the law.
TOPOLÃ¡NEK: ministers nominated by the ODS are not in question.
It is a matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that in several ministries are in náměstkovských features people who belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to relinquish the principle of the fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the house."
But it cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it is the current, I will deal with this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies the defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely the Civic Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the prime minister.
At the same time Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote on Wednesday in the house apparently voted against the amended budget, if the prime minister members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the president of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
Even when I was giving up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months will be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of all positive, reacted Topolánek.
According to the new hours of the ČD there will be fewer trains for almost the same charges.
The Czech Railways or limit from 13 December some less responsible and local trains, other connections will strengthen the contrary.
The total coverage of transport from the date of entry into force of the new timetable is reduced in comparison with today at two percent.
Most of the tariffs, including the basic and customer base will not change.
More options related to the capital gain, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava, the railways for this line will add a Pendolino trains.
On the contrary, will not move to Bratislava.
Less fast trains will also be on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct links Prague - Letohrad.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport in the region of Hradec Králové, eight per cent in total, on the other hand, Prague and surroundings.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České budějovice are also cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice - will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
One of the biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct flights from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of suburban system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance services in the capital will end in the Target Station Prague main railway station.
The ČD will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will go at two hours.
With the Pendolino since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for the regional rail: 200 million more
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kroner in total, as this year. The local trains are ordered by the regions, next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the local trains and local dráhy have a contract for ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
The railways praises the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes occur only in tickets a day - Čd net and cheap Internet eliška.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of Čd net increase of 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eliška will depend on the distance, until now, it was for regional travel between any two cities and was 160 crowns.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children were released.
The rebels have kidnapped today in the southern Philippines 75 people, including some of a primary school pupils and their teachers.

The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels have used the hostages as a shield on the run from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which has claimed the handling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed, declared martial law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, related to the election of the governor, were 30 journalists.

But on Tuesday renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days in the American cinemas, a new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech Invictus: NEPORAÅ¾ENÃ½), which is a part of the life of the former president of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid, Morgan Freeman, who chose years ago by Mandela himself.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was president of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
The film contains great expectations, as it comes at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in the preparations for the World Cup, but at the media are by disturbing news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants of the Black ruling majority.
According to the news agency Ap, the reactions to the new film in South Africa for the time being consistently positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles "profláklými" Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
Many times I have also repeatedly met with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - his energy, he said in an interview after the gala premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we can remember via the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the Book of the British writer John Carlin the title freely translated in the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation. portrays the South African defender of human rights during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman is trying during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he in his role in the South African national team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won.
On the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something almost sacred, Mandela Fourteen years ago, mostly white audience and won the recognition of the white population.
The football championship will unite people again in one nation, said the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa, that remains to be seen.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as for example in an interview for ln rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny fire for tens of millions of crowns
The fire broke out in the morning a processor of the company in a near the village Výškov in Lounsku.
The fire, according to the spokesman for the fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units.
Originally wanted to leave the processor is consumer, but later changed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause was a technical defect, an internal short-circuit the processor.
No one was injured, and according to the spokesman for the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will not be possible before the fire.
According to the processor destroyed will be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of the company CEPS nothing similar happened, defects of this kind are rare, they added.
The electricity supplies were not interrupted, the spokesman for the society Čez for northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the functioning of homes, offices and businesses not influenced by the fire.
A.G. CEPS is on the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the pipeline system, power lines of 400 kv and 220 kv.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 posts of distribution with 67 transformers transferring electricity transmission system and a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will sue for defamation against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura today complaint for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
And specifically against Michal Hasek from the south Moravia, Radko Martinek of Pardubice and the head of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura said in twenty minutes in Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company to operate a regional train services in some regions.
All regions but eventually signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are taking the raisins, while we brought the offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the price of Czech Railways, which were signed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander of the Society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
At the same time, he said that he has evidence from all districts that have their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
HAšEK considers this complaint by the continuation of the media show of Mr Jančura, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for his own person.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the name of my region and I urge other prefects to do the same.
I suppose that will be on this occasion to show clearly that it is Mr Jančura who in the cause of the regional rail transport manipulates the public and used false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that it had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will be to warn of these measures of the regions.
He said that the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue after the new year.
He said that the campaign will be waged against corruption as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the Regions agreed with the Czech railways operate rail links and for the task of approximately 150 billion kronor no tenders.
According to Jančura similar illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
Because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we do not, we will lose the bus.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against the old habits from January.
It is to be the first to be free and at the same time optional for the families.
But now voices already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already set the maximum price of vaccines, which will pay for the health insurance.
The experts are also clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children in August.
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken, born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of vaccine.
Who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, must also pay the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families left voluntarily vaccinate their children against pneumococcal.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year.
They save but in the treatment that the children without vaccination needed.
Until now, the state for all the vaccination of children around 500 000 per year.
The vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
The pneumococcal are the cause of the middle ear, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country die each year, according to surveys in hospitals to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced the vaccination of children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccination will be mandatory?
At the same time appear views, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association promotes the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association participated, were not very satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to impose at least this.
I believe that this is the way that we have to go now, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcal.
At the moment I do not consider at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
The president of the society of practical kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a reduction in the number of doses. "In a situation where the vaccine is so high amount, we understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
The experts expect that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
The vaccination against pneumokokken is a breakthrough in that it is the first vaccination of children is covered by health insurance companies, not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend more money on prevention, so that they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This is linked to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent of the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors in the same way as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some members feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies could "The money from the health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies reimburse them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters have sought to ban the construction of minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims can be integrated) in one of the most avowedly secular societies of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author: "Why the French do not like the headscarf" ("why the French don't like headscarves") (2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the country.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen called "Islamic".
He is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Should be taught to young Muslims on the evolution and gay rights?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a banking system based on the interests in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he says, which are part of the daily life, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their Salafi, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, constitute a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But the adaptation of requires compromises on both sides.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends the secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are probably a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of the Screws values."
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The most dismal view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, with a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, and fishing in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On Thin Ice" ("On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Familiar with the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who tried to seize the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14 years, fighting only with the end of his, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
Young bears, who swam for the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A presentation of circus at the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the area of the area of an adult wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: a polar bear resident in Singapore was quite green from algae that grow within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that the hunters for the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Indians Inuits in use of assault rifles, to express their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of these two nations of the hunting that ice will be longer.
In his new book, "after the ice" ("The Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of how it can be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the Atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can explain the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
The travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave evidence for the first time on the melting of the ice.
Submarines in the Cold War, the changing grate in the masses of ice.
Satellite and the extensive series of probes on icebergs are a useful supplement, but still held by brave people out in the cold.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the system within the Arctic ice, formed by chorritos of water that while freezing.
But from the bear on the ice to the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, are all condemned once the ice of summer, which can happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marines were among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The obergefreite de' Angello Robinson, 19 years, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him, and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once were in their boots.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we could be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the cemetery in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the event when he and some others decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year in various cities along the way, for events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Wreaths Across America), which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military died.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It is a small way in which civilians can support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the first and second world war and the Vietnam War, because they are not as often as the newer graves, said the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine to the stones.
Each round wreath was dark green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, the section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kroner to decorate the section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone, while others were inclined to see small black and white, pushed into the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who have wiped tears from his eyes before the grave of her son.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should never forget why we are free ... My son has paid for it, she said.
"Long after I am gone, I want someone to remember him."
The US government contractor jailed Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government to mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said on Saturday the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the section of interests of the United States in Havana trying to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, but according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to receive prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a rapprochement "slow" to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, on Friday night.
The new US policy stresses that if the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity of part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors, and in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of American citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, as distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "new Castro, same Cuba", an allusion to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities to the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists who prowls the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan, the leader of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of Al-Qaeda that the men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not discouraged and still trying to get the right approval to gain access to the camps of Al-Qaeda, when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI - underlines the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, determine who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Secret Service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization acting as Rangers, not those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits are subjected to Al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group, because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admit, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model, which so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen Climate "Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater action on the climate of the negotiators in the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists put small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city.
On a day when little happened in the talks on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying banners in English saying, "there is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "the Earth says" enough ".
Several celebrities joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the birthplace of his mother, Peru, made me aware of the problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be done, there is no way to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center, and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either disguise or pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who did not want to be identified because it is involved in the discussions on the climate, some activists with masks and black dresses placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministries.
They were for the buildings, he said, adding that began as flares, but followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march, throughout the afternoon.
But the protest not seemed to penetrate the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on climate.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English: "That is something that I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He noted that depended on the prospect of each define if the march could be harmful or helpful.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
The data of a test reveal persistent racial differences
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics, was a very good news for the public schools in the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the report card showed that pupils of fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent gap between African-Americans and white pupils, both local and national level.
The average scores of white viertklässler from Washington D. C. increased over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their peers African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
The gap between the white and black pupils in fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was in the district was 60 points scale (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was barely reduced to 58 points.
Some advocates of education in the district expressed concern last week, that the advances celebrated by the Rector Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven in large part by white students, who are already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the treatment of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates the educational equality in the district.
I am not giving leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said, member of the D.C., Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of the Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the results of test is that the secondary schools in the city have a desperate need attention.
Clearly is always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said that the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the students with low results.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new curriculum of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, which dominated the fundamentals of reading earlier in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences of real life, which was introduced in the district under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which must also be credited to the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level of the class, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which will be necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, studying the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional political solution is to focus its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington.
The objective can generate political repercussions, which is directed against the important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban, she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the essential element to end the difference in performance is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with the charter schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which it regards as a "starting point" to seek a greater increase in the next year.
Make higher education a part of a better future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a loud pipes.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, and for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and other students in eighth grade of the group explored Gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, his attitude was less of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Yes! Here is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of science.
"Wow, really?" she said, when the guide spoke of the low ratio of professors to students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visited the children on their three-day tour, and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university.
The question is where.
Although this is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who have left school or pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands to university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of the college - a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, in the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say the researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the workforce of the country.
Those who study the higher education say that they have a natural affinity for the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But the mentoring programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university, especially if these efforts continue over time.
If you look at the children of low-income, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from the garden of up to secondary school.
The federal program that funded the tour universities Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (PřIPTRAVIT), it provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to the University of preparation, programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of the high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, of which more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about the violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure, during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded by the Iraqi ministry of oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one that had an auction has lost.
Two American companies have reached agreements for the fields auctioned in June.
The poor representation of American oil giants in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of The Forum Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Safety concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military is likely to discourage American oil companies from more forcefully in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world, analysts said.
The American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because the rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have significantly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that have reached agreements with the ministry.
The major American firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, in more contracts than any other company and with large stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is on its way to becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be equal with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Companies to submit proposals made offers which were then compared with the fee per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels for each field.
The main planner of al-Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile attack along the border with Afghanistan has killed a principal planner of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, said on Friday of the counter-terrorism officials.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, on Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official of the civilian intelligence agency, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said that local militants were rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two officials of counter-terrorism unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a military planner of al-Qaeda, who led the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the American air strikes inside the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the Topführern of Al-Qaeda and translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks by the CIA has declined since the summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a Web site run by a non-profit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups, who have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN envoy in Kabul.
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but he expressed concern that the US timetable for the military withdrawal that starts in 18 months, other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghans that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military side must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was not, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now, so that he has time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better to start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has begun to seek a replacement.
The officials said that the name of Staffan di Mistura, a citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied the allegations, but he said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a good dose of scepticism with regard to the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the efforts of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, lend to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his frustration at the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, and said that the regulations cumbersome recruitment of the UN undermine their ability to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I was able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
GATES: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a trip to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good options in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
One of the things that depend on me, is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that "a package of incentives and barriers" would be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would be less safe with nuclear weapons, "because" his people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "Probable" if its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, indicated that he would resume dialogue on the restriction of its nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to be removed from the tentative agreements, in part, say the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals that actually agreed at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what he called on Thursday "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate solution in the long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, property rights and the distribution of income.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease the Kurdish anxiety about the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will protect your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
In the aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on the fact that "the mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby more means a grave more".
They have learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population in their city, changed course suddenly this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have already given all our time and energy invested in a child.
We have left for a second, said Wang, 31, a manager of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy came into force, according to the UN.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and more, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31, 1 percent in 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) has said that the fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future."
Shanghai is about to be "as old - but not so rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relief
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established by the ruling Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to help the country to avoid a critical pressure for its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples have had to carry out sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said that officials of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters encouraging families to have only one child, were replaced by copies of regulations that detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent officials for family planning and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and vsouvali leaflets under the doors.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
The head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for couples who want to a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban districts reported no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000, for example, still only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is still expected to be only around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West Assess the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we are stealing the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the Manager of Human Resources, said that he wants a single child, because she also was an only child. "We were the centre of our families and all of us.
We are not accustomed to take care of others and do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, and owner of a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For parents with two careers, middle class, which reduce the birth rate, he said, is to have enough success to be selfish.
The people of between 20 and 30 years grew up watching their parents fight during the early days of the experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child time-consuming of his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of their social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and planning -- "When the child is 9 months, you must have a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN, characterized so far by disorganized and mutual recriminations, a renewed attention on Friday with the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations, which is running out of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Produced by an ad hoc Working Group of the UN, the text does not talk about how much money would give the rich countries to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And it offers a range of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and major emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global increase in temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a great deal of flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, summed up a negotiating text of 180 pages to focus on what described the secretary-general on the UN Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion dollars per year over the next three years, to help poorer countries to adapt to the impact of climate change - from the floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same sort of verbal fireworks, which have dominated the talks last week.
The U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern, rejected the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
This train announced that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the transfer of the major developing countries and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei, said that the leading US climate negotiator either a lack of "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic direction of the major world powers at stake, both within the developing world, and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to the rescue of individual economies to save the planet, with China and the United States are bitten on their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific imperative to take action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the talks will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the Small Island States has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High-level officials, such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister, fell from the aircraft and ran through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to make claims that they were during the next week.
The sheer scale of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people in and out of the Convention Centre, the activists staged at night ironic spectacle of the countries that they are selling, and are preliminary proposals to hand on paper rather than by e-mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only built: Almost all of the key ministers are here, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome Monday
At 5 p.m., Monday morning, a whistle the darkness to point out the departure of a train that marks a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, when as a bolt from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to an international network of fast trains, reliable and connects the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become prosperous suburbs, The Times would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to the train would reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can curb the British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to The Times.
This will provide a detailed route map of the next stage of the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to identify three options for a high-speed network, leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed line should lead to the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with a branch to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most viable option," said a member of the railways.
Once this is completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 400 km / h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is designed to allow trains to 400 m in length, capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line LONDON - birmingham.
This means that a terminus in London would be necessary to 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the scheme should be continued, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should be built in sections.
The trains would have to first from the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, maintaining the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes to trains, a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of £75, 000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the senior Tory member of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of a Orangerie that he has built in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, which was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that MPs were "maintained", has increased its mortgage in £ 75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge to the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of fees agreed with that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch to the home, described in the plans as a ".
Neighbors described it as a "greenhouse for entertainment."
It was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increased loan during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on their previous mortgage agreements.
The Committee has him last month that broke the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271.406 pounds of their property in London at the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, its applications have increased to more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increase was going to finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7, 94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, the left.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1, 250 per month in May this year.
Mr Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition of the House in September, after a covert reporter filmed saying that members had to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"Basically, it is now, you have to live on the allocation and treated as M**t."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could claim the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "
The member, a millionaire from his former career as a trader oil, was the first to explain its spending in May, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the Fees Office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of the pound in the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest, after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase of the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved by both the fees office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion and durchschlÃ¤ngeln or the use of rules or whatever.
It is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be clearer or more simple. "
Come those who have faith, to see the advent calendar.
The beach in Brighton have found a new way of promotion for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative religious group that encourages the spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 every day, with blocks and wine served free of charge.
The selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and the first Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and director of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion is more relevant to the people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect that people come to an old building strange? I think that the church should come to the people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of Advent calendar of the Palapa began as a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent that through the spirituality. "
Delays in payments: Angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison guards called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment before the end of year holidays bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2 nd union of guards) asked the staff who will not be in service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning before the prisons and the "block," to denounce the theft of their due.
The CGT-PéNITENTIAIRE (3rd Union of the profession) calls to "meet in General Assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization" as "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of' overtime, night, Sundays and holidays "worked in October.
And the first trade union of guards, the autonomous federal union (UFAP / UNSA), "calls for the general mobilization (...) In order to increase the discontent and anger".
The direction of the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtime have increased significantly in 2009 and not all included in the budget, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day, that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of Supervisors guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the leadership of the prison administration immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation created by a poor assessment of the number of overtime not repeated in the future, "said Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay in December will therefore be lean, except for the exception of the management of the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the UFAP / UNSA, for whom "the budgetary constraints".
It is a pure scandal, said outraged the union interregional fo in Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October are not paid in December, as well as for overtime, also threatens fo Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are more and more tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to the money of the staff, "the CGT-PéNITENTIAIRE of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less affected than others.
But in any case, however, it is not expected, said the secretary-general of the UFAP, Jean-François forget.
For Christmas, Obama says that "best gifts" than those who receives
The US president, Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the "papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule of gifts: "I give better than those who receive."
In the framework of a special programme, which will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC chain, the president and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the end of year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "Of course" a gift, according to excerpts of the programme broadcast in advance.

Attempt to leave the president Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday that the conditions were not ripe for the transfer on its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to Zelaya, returned to their place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate General for Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad to give him a safe conduct.
But the president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state.
The coup government "has a new defeat by asking me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, which is often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request of safe-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept because it contains no request for asylum, said on Wednesday the minister of the interior of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, the Honduran HRN radio.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, responded Manuel Zelaya in an interview with The channel Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure of Honduras, do as president of the Honduran people, he said.
The rumours about the departure of Mr Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the military had stepped up its use.
The Brazilian foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had moved closer to the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day when he had organized a referendum in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will be responsible for the crime of "high treason" of the justice, according to the government.
The President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial ballot recognized by the United States, but disputed by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted overwhelmingly against the return of Zelaya to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.

USA: The lawyer for Polanski once again of the prosecution
The lawyer Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has called again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of sexual abuse happened more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the Second District of California serious errors of procedure at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I called for the abandonment charges here and now, said M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, the Judge Rittenband (died since then) would have discussed, before his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had declared at the end of September, that "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel has called for the holding of a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no dropping of the charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the announcement of his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "calls a favour to the court, although despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make their decision, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Hummel was not the only one to request the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client no longer tolerate the harassment of the Polanski case, and added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, enough is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by the rise of the dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market that is torn between indicators better than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.

The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4, 06 points) to 1.106, 41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, "said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
He remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of economic indicators better than expected, and that "helped to improve the view of the market about the strength of the economic recovery," analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
The US consumer confidence has also significantly improved in December, 73, 4 67, 4 against the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the index of the University of Michigan.
However, the indices were hampered by a new rise of the dollar, which is the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "pushes down the sensitive sectors to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
The technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the Treasury bond to 10 years rose to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday evening, and the good to 30 years to 4,497% against 4,492% the day before.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who is hospitalized for several days.
The news are very positive.
It is very strong, and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday told the press at the exit from the plane, which flew from Paris shortly after 13 p.m. local time (21 h GMT).
The son of the singer, a relaxed, assured that he would move "quickly" to the hospital cedars-sinaï Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday on Monday because of a bacterial infection after the operation of a slipped disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent pain and his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors of the hospital cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection after a disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be in the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of the serious damage caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French of Los Angeles, which their daughter Jade, to attend a school, a photographer of the AFP.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel on Monday to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has the neurochirurgen Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November in the Clinique International du Parc Monceau, in Paris.
They told us that it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial process, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "much too quickly, and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I spoke directly with the doctor and assured me that there was no problem in the trip, because I had already two disc, he added.
Shortly before in the station RTL, indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything," after his operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to a haematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor with bad reputation, condemned by Justice, in medical care, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" defendant "regularly" before the Council of the order, and which is "far from advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are growing since this summer, entered into a parenthesis.
It is, a resumption of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the new centre on the use of its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the modem François Bayrou, responded Friday to the takeover attempt by the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former party, to be used on any support, under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (Ex-ump, now in NC), which claims ownership of the trademark UDF, because it was the first to register in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the Office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou, who do not want to be deprived of his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and to use the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the mark, on pain of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have made many statements that you propose to your political movement to restore the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle De Sarnez of the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on their promotional materials and on the page of your site, the name of this movement, the + Nouveau Centre +, the slogan + UDF today +, the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the Office of the UDF that the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF all support, and (their) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks the legitimate owners."
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, require that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "The Choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la Démocratie française).
They also point out that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continuing the office, "when he filed the mark," he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on their own account.
This indiscretion is transforming into a crime, denounce, before mockery of the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more valuable to make a name for yourself to try to get out of the anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: FranÃ§ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of the state of weakness of the 80-year-old to rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of 375.000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a process in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter are battling the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not in the conditions proposed by the Public Prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday will submit a report before the 10 March 2010, in which you clear whether Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think that it will accept.
I will speak to her, said the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The expertise will show that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt a criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or paintings.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which it sees as a long-standing friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk since their marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, once again, that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has finally decided that it would once the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Managerial Revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of the Economic Intelligence have been in vain ...
For more than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees, said the position of companies with regard to consumers before the Revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as it was necessary to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians of factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has the marketing strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors preferences of customers again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly executives.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R &amp; D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the (business intelligence) "requires that all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it needs by employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of the authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which would be to put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal polls.
The internal polls, as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
- First, because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, and after many twists and turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... what it has always done.!
- secondly, because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power increases in proportion to the importance of their own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major schools of Engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
Take, for intellectual comfort, the old behavioristische theory, reactivated recently by the "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge of the Institutes and the media.
Thus, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanistic management system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of the modern business, the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional Analysis This conception of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on the basis of a predetermined Doxa which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors of mobilization, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and their human resource management "in the place."
They create a fertile ground for the development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
The speech of OSLO: The "just war" Obama receives praise from the right.
The American right on Friday the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé the awarding of the prize to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former candidate for the vice-presidency in the elections of 2008.
I liked what he said, "said Mrs Palin, muse of the right wing of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "war in his memoirs recently published.
The war is, of course, the last thing in my view that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job".
I think that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the mention of "The existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
In a way, I found this speech was historic, Gingrich said during an interview in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen a "president of the left" when reminded the members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, a former pen of George W. Bush and now editor of The Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech".
In addition to present themselves as "citizen of the world", "as it always does," He spoke as an American president "to remind the Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it, "said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, turgid and without inspiration" on the Site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, "he warned.
The press of centre-left, however, at the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described his speech "superproduction" Even for a speaker who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper.
Obama "the speech that was necessary," said the New York Times, "At the same time dark and uplifting."
ROAD: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of marathon, the unions of the road sector and the TLF, the only employers' organisation, which remained until the end, arrived on Friday evening to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat that hung over the supply of Christmas.
During the meeting of signatures on Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" by the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope to sign quickly the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
And even though the three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, Otre) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting which began at 11 hours that all agree and the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "It was feared that the holidays at the end of the year," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate for the lowest salary increases from 8, 72 euros to 9, 06 euros.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our activists that there are no more cuts or blockages in the centres of supply.
But there can always be some who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases in the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros a month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for the employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the" historic agreement ".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month salary and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of 100 million euros in employers' was the subject of an amendment to the government on the draft budget for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to "identical" vote.
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement will apply initially to companies to this organization, and secondly, the entire profession, in the event of an extension of the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trading", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency, not as a result of a joint analysis, but not to eat turkey in the next Christmas Eve, deplored the UNOSTRA.
For the OTRE, the agreement "to a very large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months."
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A, the largest urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday, the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP, the strikers with their demands for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be no trains between 10 and 20, on a train on two on the central section (between La Défense and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will force passengers to change train.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "The RATP efforts to serve the large stores."
The RER A crosses from west to east of Paris.
The section of the RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains circulated at peak hours, and almost no train in off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no menschengewühl on the platforms, the inhabitants of the Ile de France to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained that had lifted "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The station Saint-Lazare has not been saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had predicted the supervision of police and security forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-le-haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will evaluate the results, deemed "weak" by the trade unions, a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, professional development, etc.
However, that is not what they want drivers, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).
The RATP puts even its proposals premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday to "comprehensive examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What also led to the trade unions to say that the company "scoffed users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers the establishment of a committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict could spread to the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice of UNSA and independent.
The unions are calling for a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line with a million passengers daily.
The drivers of the RER, all in the second part of career, charge of 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros for hours, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The party for a Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the president of the court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, adding that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its president Ahmet Türk and Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision followed a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government is a hand to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, to try to stop supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east populated mostly by Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of the justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) dissolving a party, "he told the press.
The government, formed by a Party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, "said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks of recent months.
New silicon-valley
For many years, it was seen as a secret city, inaccessible to the Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site of secret weapons research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Russian Silicon Valley."
Significant research and production of micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with riedberg, place of science - with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were a number of mutual visits and signed on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol of close cooperation."
The Moscow vice-mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect, Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific research, will depart at Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The Fiz companies will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market.
The Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for the weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") received its name from the forested hills of landscape, in which the research facilities are located.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the supporters of the project is simply of "The new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade in utter chaos construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks, which ended in the middle of the city, was seen at the Technical fossils of the 19th century, who acted as a modern rail traffic, since it was once a huge amount of time to get the locomotives from back to the front.
Arrival, stop for a moment, go on - so it should be done.
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about half of the trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, of course, have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are modern trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21, including the new line to Ulm.
The regional and local politicians.
The Rail continues, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayer and not the state company.
From the point of view, the project is still reasonably justified.
It creates new urban space, which - if we believe the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the construction of the section are designed for passenger transport, which - typical of the 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from cheap flights.
But the modern transport policy must go to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the road.
But the new route is due to the intense gradients, not suitable for freight trains.
Even more serious is that the S21, indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros should be buried in the.
This is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion is more realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the Good 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to support here on the tube.
But the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport, right in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport.
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court (VGH) on the Prohibition of night flights.
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to the legal point of view the judgment of the more than 400 pages, said the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had founded in writing on this date, which in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport, the state would have to regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the provincial government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population against the night air noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it wants to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressure on the representatives of the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban on night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a lack of a word.
It is hellishly difficult, if you can keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir, referring to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
The minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-gümbel, that the federal government would be trying to through distortions of the law and tricks "to their night flights.
A precise legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a decision legally, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition, the statements of his group on the Prohibition of night flights.
US banks repay aid
The big American banks buffeted by the crisis of their state shackles.
The Bank of America paid at once in the middle of the assistance from the bank rescue fund TARP amounting to a total of $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros).
And also the Citigroup is planning according to a report by the US channel CNBC to repay the state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of restrictions that had gone hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of managers, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America to the investors convertible bonds well 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the amount taken from the own box, which was filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the director general of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped to overcome a very difficult time.
The money had at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup wants to exempt from their obligations to the state also money in the capital market.
CNBC reported that the American bank could announce on Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion dollars.
A spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid their aid.
Rapid election
It was a faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board of the editor-in-chief of Nikolaus Brender pushed out of the office, the station can present a successor.
Yesterday evening the Committee wanted to vote on the Personalie.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation from the station, however - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter If this proposal would not be accepted by the Council.
Frey, the candidate of Schächter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known to the closure of drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Administrative Council with its proposal to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter defeat for schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the Union majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the election, he does not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Land of Hesse, Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the chief of prestigious with the argument that under the News of the ZDF have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end even 35 staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate and who felt that the Koch as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
About The Person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked in the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey changed to the ZDF, first to the news magazine "Heute-Journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal spoke of the; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; Until 1998 director and presenter of the "morgenmagazins"; until 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens announced a constitutional complaint.
The opponent of Koch in the Council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should change the state of the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the supervisory bodies of the ZDF, however, Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Peter Frey, recommended to the board with a smart move: criticised the body immediately after the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face, as the Administrative Board, without the suspicion that a partisan office.
In the arithmetic of the Parties Frey is classified left-wing liberals.
Study
Partial success for the students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the lÃ¤nder decide to be more conciliatory: At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions in bachelor and master.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of reviews: Basically each module of the race to finish with a single test.
In addition, the workload of the students and to ensure "a realistic and acceptable."
Politics and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed to establish a more flexible common structural targets for bachelor and master.
At the regional level, there should not be.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and the university rectors winged words in the mouth of a better education.
Now for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council decided to drastically reduce the number of tests in part: "Each module ends with only one test," says in a 30-page document, which is intended to regulate the approval of the university careers.
"significantly reducing the burden," said chairman of the accreditation council Reinhold Grimm, should be stopped, which significantly the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should be, in the future, "the decisive criterion" in the configuration.
The modules and content must be examined carefully to see whether "unnecessary einengungen of students in the choice of courses.
The courses.
Students should "entitled to the space, which allows and encourage the own initiative."
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing careers.
These must be "réaccrédités" every five years, which means that it will take until 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
Responsible for ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to the accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too big and not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and technical colleges with the ministries have already agreed to take the appropriate measures.
As the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
With this money universities must organize programs and study advice, as well as strengthen offices of examinations and abroad.
The Länder and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Law on Higher Education Institutions.
According to be for the conclusion of a study model only a single test.
The Organization of the race should be more flexible, to be guaranteed the recognition of tests from other universities and facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year, should be checked performance of all of the country.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to the praise there was also criticism of the decisions.
The board of the federal president of the university groups called for the creation of education policy is in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strikes of Education, now the students as main involved should be able to speak a little.
The future graduates received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which the HRK working on a common reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn do not go far enough: The union demands a legal right to each student with the title of bachelor access to a cycle of master's degree.
Second, the land must ensure that for the current generation of students bachelor there will be enough places in the Masters degree with the best possible conditions of study, as good as a member of the GEW, Mr Andreas Keller.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not have free access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
In Germany and it is beautiful, almost no control ... "is the first line of a poem of the Poet Werner Söllner, in which this in troubling language shreds the arrival experience of a dissident, who won the freedom, but lost at the same time its language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as reader in a children's book publishing, before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes, in 1993, the legendary Frankfurt poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he is head of the Forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Given that speak quite last Tuesday, during a meeting in Munich, where "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of your files."
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as an informer for the Romanian Securitate secret service.
Together with some of the present söllner had received in 1989, the German language prize.
The recruitment attempts had begun, first in 1971.
I am, "so someone who is not sufficiently attempts to intimidation of the Securitate."
The Poet Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same time of the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that indicates the depths and the cowardice of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can be said to the current state of knowledge, not only author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate, Im Walter had played a role, said the literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter.
"He had him in all difficult for him at the time", according to Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
The statement söllner in this form and before this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however, is not surprising.
Germany is a reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the weekly "Zeit", having read their own acts, 914 pages.
The, it can be assumed, will have made speculation and will be known in some cases, what names were hiding behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the revision of the files Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the legacy of the Securitate is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), corresponding to the Authority, was formed in 1999, the publication of the files since then rather slow.
Only since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of the files.
An interview, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, proof that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to speak here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, inevitable questions associated with the case söllner, as so often in the context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Who was hurt? The reaction to the confession of söllner leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by the desire for knowledge rather than the guilt and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
In the Champions League
When the new coach VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a plastic bag of Christmas party of the supplier of his team, addressed a taxi Mercedes Class C a quarter of an hour after midnight, gave the impression that a member of the supplier of a very nice Christmas, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had distributed samples.
The man with the driver, because the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - Alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness was the 55-year-old as Little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue to work.
Or would start for the first time.
In the words of the only three days before: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success: It is a brutally tough fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then, it is important to repeat in Mainz the royal class and in the league.
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses again after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing
The eighth final of the Champions League (HINSPIELE 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / return match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will be on the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the Babbel successor remained so.
Not only the alleged healer, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went to the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, and I told them to be more courageous, the of souls Gross explained as simple-sounding recipe for success, but that with the therapist Babbel but no longer had any effect.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel, "In football when there is a new impetus, sometimes things that we would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the best player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the operation of the new leader: "He is a man who and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
In Babbel's obviously missing.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns the manager Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
As Gross, the players and the manager, the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened the Romanian guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0: 4, Khedira.
And the manager Horst Heldt reminded that they had achieved a goal of the season, but the other is still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that other and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of the board, which had decided to change coach under pressure pubertierender fans.
Also that his free day was removed after the Games, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements were "marked by a pure selfishness," said Heldt and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty.
In any case, they agreed with all the others, that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
The world championship heavyweights
Hitziges duel in Bern: challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title of heavyweight in the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
HAMBURG - Vitaly Klitschko Remains Box world champion in the heavyweight.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the federation WBC announced that on the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko It was the third successful defence of the title since his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it turned out that all expected.
Klitschko built his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice had to give due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept its first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena of 2, 02 metres tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, above all, with his left hand.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel had announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring a decisive blow his dangerous.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to move the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes hit the world champion but only rarely.
It is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who fought with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie" that "is not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was unable to Johnson glasses of the nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the return of Klitschko.
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, he defeated in his title of the title to Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only received a blow in this fight, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his rapid return to the ring.
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
But it is the British David Haye, after the 2.13 metres - in November, the belt of the WBA.
In the summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company plans to fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: The head of the Group of the Greens, JÃ¼rgen Trittin, called liar Defence Minister Guttenberg because of false information on the Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left (left) to the chancellor.
Hamburg / BERLIN - according to the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly bombing of two tanks in September, said the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday in the broadcast of news "Tagesschau".
Call it the usual expression: he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report, the NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that in the attack not only about the destruction of the abducted, but also to kill two leaders Taliban.
In the air attack on the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the report of NATO, died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Saturday federal chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately before the federal Parliament and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government, and if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor has no effect on the concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, also had transcended doubts about the presentation of the ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the Spiegel, the two Guttenberg correctly and completely against the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the reports of NATO and the Minister sensitive details.
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner SonntagsZeitung" reports that Wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter to clarify the situation.
So far it has not received a response, it said.
The ministry did not comment on Saturday on the allegations and pointed out that this is in the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament, which will be the next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some people see in Wachem state images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can indulge the wildest ideas and fantasy.
However, WHO Experience of dream, hears and sees things that others do not see or hear in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addict, or at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or in the drug.
Blame is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality.
The states of the altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect may differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, Schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations to similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural substances of the brain - particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholin - and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him.
The relationship between madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity between the madness with states," to Sigmund Freud was the dream even was "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusions, and delusions of it".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic.
His body is in two dimensions and Quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red as blood, deformed, the teeth.
They continue, with heavy boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Loud, evil voices from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook in the ceiling.
It is rising on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
Jumps.
The loop stands out.
What you will serve as a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir, "Go in the clinic and treat!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, it is maniaco-dÃ©pressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is as the second most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of the acute schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of which can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relational or persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish between the important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
As the dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies, which come from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the university hospital in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, it is like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and can actively shape.
That is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
Unlike in the dream, says, "the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remain in principle."
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real framework.
Exactly why our brains, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead to any person to lose touch with the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, which is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because they interfere in the transmitter system.
When our brains.
This is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take medicines very expensive to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
The perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and delusions, in the last year he has its results in the book "Die Welt in unserem Kopf" The unreal world in our head).
The hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that normally are repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are HyperActives or little repressed; if our brains, but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, worry about love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, one third of the respondents, at least once in a lifetime experience a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and to a secondary school.
A normal girl.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair.
When he replies, look at the classmates It surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that the timid girl is a dreamer, but Sarah K. does not dream, it knows it.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It is a pleasant feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, asks sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other visions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are frightening.
The visions are often a burden.
When it is in the class, it can follow the lesson because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new colleague, while for all the other and visible on the board of mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are frightening.
While waiting in the dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, often cannot distinguish whether it is awake or asleep, if the images that sees, the Fratzen or the girl with bleeding wounds on the arms and legs, before their open or closed.
Leave me alone, shouts to the figures.
Parents and Friends say anything, it is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, knows that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of incentives, it is very likely that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I believe that the brain is not enough, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, she was a little girl fear of the other children, often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, he learned that the man she called Daddy, since she thinks is not his biological father.
Since the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that process also real impressions and noise, it is for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between illusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy people are able to recognise their visions as unrealistic.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the imaginary experience is, unfortunately, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - Madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a special form of the conscience awakened by the dream.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the erlebende for real and that it cannot differentiate of being awake.
The states aware arise in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, as for example in patients who experience a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a person is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total inability to move, it replaces the real situation of his life, by his own imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A kind of grenzzustand between dream and hallucinations.
As it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself that our own ability to us, not in a nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on journeys of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a heart transplant, while his body was sentenced to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a world created by the same and visited places of other times: He was in bed, old man in a train, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by noble who manufacture drugs from blood.
He was abducted by a Greek on the motorcycle in his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the Alps and hits a Korean mafia.
It is completely in this imaginary world, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the mental disorders even after years and in the details.
Even clearer and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the Oneirismo, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile our internal images of the external reality, even when we are awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take charge of the publishing house with 27 years
The new head of publishing Kallen is an intermediate solution: In the long-term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said the Spiegel.
The holding is also in the future to 100% of the family.
HAMBURG - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term, in the hands of their children.
The two children will inherit with 27 years and have a strong will to enter into the company, said the 69, Spiegel.
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to 7500 staff their children, if they are not sufficiently competent.
That would demolish the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from January from the presidency of the board, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.
Kallen, 52 years since 1999, is a member of the board of Burda.
First, he was responsible for the technology.
Later, with the Treasury the responsibility for the company's assets and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the editorial.
The children are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who would today be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10, 15 years, "Burda said.
The holding should be 100% in the hands of the family.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not before the sinking: "It has always affected families who have been infected by a capital, which have misjudged and thought that they could rise as the largest player.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had "dreams of world power," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with "Time", these shops have become too big.
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to watch his e-mail, without the possibility of even see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given the success of the company has launched two new devices: One is designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life, for six times more for the peek.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited, as its American counterpart, but with a surprise.
The price of monthly maintenance, of about 12 euros a month, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up the data when it crosses the border, or seek desperately a cafeteria with WiFi (or a connection of FON) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be in a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe, have had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin is afraid to use the data, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device as Fonpeek (it is always curious that it has the name of FON when he does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, includes the downloading of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without snags.
It is a device connected and pay for the purchase, and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fonpeek, a purchase option with access to life as peek already has in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
But I expect that, because I think that it is a model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the favorite color of the American first lady.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama is a model very similar models in both occasions: in addition to the same colour - yellow green with bright, both times, the dress was composed of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So that at first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States to follow in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and decided to the same.
But the fabric in which are the two sets makes them very different.
If for the inauguration of was a fit fat, in Oslo is a velvet with.
The accessories are also different: green shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but in Golden, now.
The hair was different: the hair on this occasion, before her hair.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study "fertility and career of women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers saw limited opportunities in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have a stable, begin before the couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood, and have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after the beginning of cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with a stable job needed more time of its vital to achieve them, which has led to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work a groβen influence on motherhood, but less than the calendar of the pairing ", explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that difference the age of women at the time of the marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the greater the age when women marry and have their first child.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at the age of 25, 1 and 32, respectively.
"There is another difference between the women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those with average or higher invest this sequence and give priority to obtain a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth
L'orÃ©al Paris has just added a new name to its list of: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of various products of the mark, the universal slogan "Because you are worth it.
The protagonist of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on the international level, is another famous Osobnosteml'oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter the club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto (' Slumdog Millionaire').
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The prices of the British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual delivery of their price, which took place in London, in the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presented in "Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers who have crossed his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
It does not do so in the sexes predictable and apprehended (short biography, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither the scares nor illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation to readings and Relectures.
Here are some observations.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the same as I felt without the name: The Pleasure against the fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, without any sense, as the blade of the knife, which almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, in whose meat the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach the sky through the path of undoing."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight thousand metres of the universal literature, he must climb by the north wall, on which the best climbers and again."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
In itself, he said that he was the heir of a landowner in the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness. "
On Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line: "this writer took the cry insane launched from a bridge by this man from Munich to carry its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form and did so in a journey fleeing itself, and invoking posterity with a speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to its knees and prayed:" God, I would ask you to do that I stop writing as a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engravings these verses of Spenser:" Sleep after the effort, / After the storm the port, / The rest after the war, / After Life, tired death. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage also their depression.
The husband accepted quite normal that she told him that Edward VII between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
It has never been a man as patient and lover of a neurotic, whose literary talent exceeded the madness. "
On PÃ­o Baroja: "What did MartÃ­n-Santos, than to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja?
What tried benet if it is to the arms of Faulkner?
What did the glory of that man so that he would own pedestal? "
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother was about 70 years of age by our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved from the and with no more than six kilos, and without a word, they assenèrent him that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal which, moreover, was on the leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and that, when these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since a énergumène attacking an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a police station that we doubt that serves much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety (FESVIAL), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helm, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the hull, because it is the only element of protection to prevent injuries in the head, or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said that it also contributes to this objective by other actions educational and informative.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the slogan' To Be or Not to be ", will have a first phase in which will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and sellers Ganvam.
However, the good news, since the reference to the comparison - November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared with the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rise in the last month, the accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous financial year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles entering the category of light commercial: derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and light trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand, because even if they are also purchased by individuals, the most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
So to the restrictions that represents the tap closed of bank loans, it must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation, unlike the cars, the financial support for the purchase of the 2000 E have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Just yesterday, in Ganvam, reminded again the need to pay special attention on the part of the administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association predicts a year 2010 similar to the year, for which it calculates a drop in sales of passenger cars and 4 X4) of 19%.
The support for the emergency brake is now mandatory
As happened with the anti-lock ABS brakes and will happen with the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems to the emergency brake will be a compulsory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of absence until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, even if its mode of action, it can also help to prevent many collisions.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, the system detects by the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revancha, requires the maximum the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even more important with the so-called Intelligent Emergency Braking Systems: It is estimated that one of every four would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum pressure on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably the 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may be that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers and then the governments of the countries in which there are factories, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, from GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer, to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM ADMITS being in contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group converg.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some assets of Saab to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their last and precious jewel, engineers of the Porsche Boxster S as a base and managed to adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, in the first place, the automatic roof which has been replaced by a zeltleinwanddach with manual, thereby save 21 kilos, to employ doors in aluminum as the GT3, "disappear" further 15; by the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, won 7 kg; the other 12 and with the light 19 inches, five.
Finally, the system of audio CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of the doors for each question, the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK dual clutch, the test was carried out on a vehicle with manual box of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads of California, in the mountain with routes.
His behaviour can be described as beyond reproach.
The reduction of weight does not mean that the car is not the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, the opposite: It was a long time that we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, guarantees of security in the curve, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short march during the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, to recover and return to eke out its engine ...
What we want. Thanks to his leadership, as communicative as accurate, which indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
The sound of the engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be strengthened with the option' sport' and through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from unemployed or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we have travelled with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car well the potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves are ice at dawn and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultra-light, the more fun to drive on the market, and it is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70.831 euros.

The BASKONIA is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a resounding triumph for 82-91 During his visit to the complicated of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple was the best of his team (29 assessment).
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 triple points to do in the final triumph.
The match began quickly to the blue and red, who from the beginning of the brand.

English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team alavés opted for the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pitos and applause in the return to his former home, to increase their advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minus six' assessment of splitter already suggested that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being on track at the break, it was decided, and the Makkabäer wanted to remind that on their pitch not earn anyone, and with "the hand of Elías" They came in the party.
Eidson and PNINI contributed decisively to the "yellow" the helm in the limelight (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but far from dead, needed a few games to catch air, and these came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas returned to a reassuring (54-67), which reached the local at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses came to the skin in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that they would not allow anyone to take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with splitter eliminated for mistakes, the team of Ivanovic is not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis in the last minute (80-85), the party was already a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented the Unicaja fight
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead in Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship, nor by the scale of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed to dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defense and three consecutive points, two of them by Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio, dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the domestic game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, to fight between the two American bases Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to work in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Between the players and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its triple, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
A rebound impossible
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, despite the 19 losses, was superior and even managed to match the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the leadership of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the disadvantages for the Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and the triple of Cook, and the use of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, in the 31st minute.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when Apretaba and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute, the basket average 81-62, and the Unicaja and the leadership of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when its mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'Affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he hides from 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must go on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, it must seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections on 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the status of political asylum, which he tried to save the government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, the uncertainty in the markets, which is not surprising, since it is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by free of liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to throw some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain the economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, although they are still a long way from the levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an extension of the differences of the euro zone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard &amp; Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of the moral hazard, who tried to create awareness of the responsible for the global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the credit on the destruction of employment, when what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates and Greece we have seen before.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections and a new government that the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro has not fulfilled its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies do not have to worry.
If the European gap decreased and that our continued to increase, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators are forcing the majority of services of studies to anticipate its scenarios of recovery and to revise its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver."

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and other 60 billion from that date and 2030, where nuclear power plants, which are currently in operation.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments will not be of 60 billion, but up to 95 million.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for the capture of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW of more are needed, but with other "Energies of support."
Galán, who believes that the draft law of sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government is in line with what his company, did not want to make blood with the Royal Decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" In this sense, despite the measures "one-off", as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that the investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must begin to take now, because it will take some time and a stable framework is needed to address them.

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for his first motorway concession in Australia, the market in which it is already working as a company of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as construction and motorway operators.
The city of the city wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After opting for the public-private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, in possession of a business plan under the tutelage of erns &amp; Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
In anticipation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounted to 1.7 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European construction.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest european specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium northern direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian Transfield infrastructure and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is that has passed the test is called Lbrjv, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company specializing in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises great works and privatisations, but carries a clear difficulty of entry if it is only through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the Hochtief or Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to Asian references, and which remains an example for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has achieved a position in the market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Acciona is betting on the geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of the desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park, waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies to build and manage the desalination plant in Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground toll, promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (North), is called to join the western motorway in toowong with the umgehungstraβe in Kelvin Grove (see map) over 5 km tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Despite the fact that this road toll will be open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not anticipated that the work is topped until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers business Hochtief
Australia continues to Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday, obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber-optic cable.
This action will provide quick access to the Internet 400,000 people and will work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has crossed the construction project of the tower King George towers with 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet started and Hochtief has closed the sale in 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.

Fine of 63 million for France Télécom to curb competition
The regulator for competition in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros Lfrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile phone with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and programmes of loyalty to consumers on the edge of the Regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state the company accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994, because of its competitors.
The sentence imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority which oversees the competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past, and that it is therefore a relapse.
SHOP OF APPLICATIONS
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other operators and has opened a shop of Internet applications, with the aim to increase the revenue that do not come from the transmission of voice.
In principle, the shop of applications of Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
Will have to wait until 2010 to it happens in other countries, such as Spain.
The game in the Champions League has brought to Real Madrid and Barça since the beginning 476, 4 million.
The Champions League has become a source of income for the clubs since its inception in 1992.
So, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476, 4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has distributed 5.362, 5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the season 1992/1993, according to data from UEFA.
Real Madrid and the F. C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent, with the most money for his participation, and the only one with the AC Milan, which has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the Classification.
The list of leading Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that, moreover, charged the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved through the Champions money, although it has more titles than any other (five, four of Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini, with revenues of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413, 1 million for fixed payments: Each of the 20 clubs who participated in the preliminary round of classification (including the AtlÃ©tico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million only be there, in addition to the 550.000 euros for each match, which they denied.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 for each team). Osmifinalisté get three million each; eight čtvrtfinalistů3, 3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
The champion will win 9 million, in contrast to the 5.2 million.
Thus, the concept of fixed payments, a club at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, which are 337, 8 million.
This money is distributed according to the value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the main, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only earn the car garages.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are towed to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
No sinister is equal, and the calculation of the cost of the parts and labor time can be a long and complex task.
Calculate the cost of the repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of systems.
The suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers, and then to treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group, is the company leader; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.

Audatex invests 90 million euros per year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common use is the use of the repairs and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of spare parts or to calculate the or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports about the value of used cars in Spain, is Eurotax.

Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AUDAVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
Audaglass focuses on the glasses of the vehicles, and Audasubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows for vehicles declared total sinister.

Budget of workshop in four steps
With the tool Auda-taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, seek the spare parts, create budget and generate budget.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially in order to convince the older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, it is necessary to use a computer with an Internet connection.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of the model in question, and then select the needed spare part.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
Audataller is not a tool of assessment as audaplus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is focused on service and does not include an estimate of the labor.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inner side.
