What is? the čssd in prague knows no neither to voldemort nor the pastelería
The new concejales čssd in the capital will have to overcome, as it seems, the barreras lingüísticas obvious to the components of the college of prague and the council understand their renewed colleagues of the ods.
The period aktuálně. cz "examinó" to the members of the new council of the čssd to see their knowledge of the language marked slang that has arisen in recent years in the council, when gobernaban prague the current member states of the coalition.
The diccionario codificado that used flor and nata policy in prague during the previous period, the mayor pavel bém, includes some of the figures, and more known causes of the metrópolis situations.
Sorprendentemente, has been comprobado that the new concejales almost not comprenden these known concepts.
At least, that they say.
"Who is voldemort?"
"The truth is that i do not know."
"I am rather a novato in the praguense policy," he said during the examination of terminología "colegueo" the councillor of culture lukáš kaucký.
And in what respecta the veterano politician, reacted like karel březina.
Perhaps conozcan the concept "hoyo of golf."
"Perhaps is the only expression of all that i preguntasteis use of time in when."
"If not, normally not employment slang."
The glosario, whose definiciones published the newspaper aktuálně. cz last june before the vote on the ods congress, the wording escogió six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the authorities municipales in prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "voldemort," "greater hoyo golf of prague," "go to the pastelería," "nuca bull," "traición of the capital" and "blindar."
Three concejales accepted someterse the test and a quarter, antonín weinert, that in future will be responsible for education in prague, the principle accedió, but not returned to pick up the telephone.
The fifth councillor, petr dolínek, refused directly to do so.
"I am not meto in these things and i think valorar how divierten civic democrats."
"What yes i matters is how we entenderemos in the implementation of our programmes," pointed out.
As has been seen, supposedly the councillor lukáš kaucký does not have taken account of the previous title is an expression of an influential employer and a friend of the exalcalde bém, roman janoušek.
To kaucký the word "voldemort" told nothing; the only term that acertó in the examination is "the largest hoyo of golf of prague."
"This is the túnel blanka," kaucký says, that adds immediately: "but rather i know by the news."
"I am going to have to apuntar a course of languages," bromea.
Karel březina is not the only that reconoce in the hoyo of golf túnel blanka, but also the environment lukáš councillor plachý.
After, both sociodemócratas know who is really voldemort and lukáš plachý even knows where to find that person; in addition, suspicion the meaning of "go to the pastelería."
"I believe that means go to a company in prague"; it soon desvela to plachý that this is the seat of the companies janoušek.
As březina, indicates that such knowledge obtained the news, but that does not employs such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, between the sociodemócratas there is no glosario so familiar terms coloquiales.
"Pregunté to my colleagues, but really think that we do not have anything resembling."
"Rather, between us utilizamos apodos, sometimes abreviaturas or do games of words with the nombres," says the president of the čssd praguense, petr hulínský, whose fellow party call hulda.
"In the college i called bříza, but not know if my colleagues also i call," their own apodo karel březina admits.
The newspaper aktuálně. cz to test the name and works.
For their fellow party, weinert is děda (similar "yayo"), or less amigable dědek ("old"), miroslav poche representative, with the asociaron before the elections engaños during the patrocinio of the party, receives the apodo of "igráček" ("playmobil") on the part of some of their colleagues.
The apodos also are the únicas expressions which the sociodemócratas toleran in the talks within the party.
To hulínský not i like to llamen hulda, but the newspaper aktuálně. cz descubrió even other apodos for this president praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the porras" according to seems recalls that petr hulínský obtained its doctorado right in the bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of the "brujas," as published in a folleto
Women regarded as brujas in burkina faso share certain characteristics.
Often have a age avanzada, cannot work, for example, for reasons of health, are solteras and does not have children.
The women "return" brujas is sent to an area aislada, not to perjudiquen the rest of the people.
"Men rare time sufren such but."
"Nor aísla young women sanas, because help in the labores and have children," explains a monja that, in the capital of the state of western áfrica burkina faso deals in a special residence of more than 100 women expulsadas of their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this inusual "social."
Emitió a folleto information that should contribute to avoid the caza of brujas.
However, this is a pega.
"More than 70% of the adultos in burkina faso not knows read," warns the newspaper die standard on the disadvantages of the awareness by written.
The accusations of brujería also are common in other countries africanos.
In wins, neighbouring country of burkina faso, last week died ammy hemmah, 72 years, when the torturaron three women and two men, the cubrieron of petrol and quemaron.
The news appeared on the bbc.
The authors afirman debió to a desgraciado cúmulo of circumstances.
According to its version, women will prendió in the aceite used for the unciones rituales.
Is prendió in llamas when the group wanted to "expulsar to the bad espíritus" of women.
The isolation of the people "brujas" the support of all the educativos levels.
The newspaper der standard quoted an employer 42 years of burkina faso: "the devoradores of human almas always represented a danger," he said.
While in burkina faso the government tries to apaciguar caza of brujas, in gambia last year still involved in the president.
"The president gambiano jammeh, following the death of their old aunt, launched a large caza of the brujas that, supposedly, had been relacionadas with their death and had tried to kill the own president through the black magic."
"For ayudarle brought to chamanes of the close guinea which, protegidos by police, militares and the escolta staff of the president, led to the strength to men and women escogidos aleatoriamente between the pueblos gambianos to the property of the president kanilai," señala in its report the amnesty international organisation.
In the farm, the people arrestadas had to beberse a pócima herbs with effects alucinógenos that, in addition, they caused problems intestinales and renales.
Two of those arrested not sobrevivieron the estancia in the farm.
After the international pressure, finally liberaron around a thousand people detenidas.
The inquilino of bakala: calienta with estufas of carbón and signing a rent more high
The man, age avanzada and recio, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the customer of the company rpg byty "magnate the carbón" zdeňek bakala, the greater private owner of pisos rent in the czech republic.
Under the arm had documents with the new contracts rent of three pisos: the suyo, of your daughter and his son, who is cumpliendo judgment.
In the three i has just pillar the liberalización rents.
Instead of 3.500 czk per month, the son pagará from next year 4.100 kroner by a two estancias with cocina apartment separada of second category.
"In addition, do not have of water caliente fuel and the calefacción based in a caldera sólido," shows with the dedo man in the new contract of her son, on whose signature is full poderes.
"But firmé," explains the enfadado, the resignado.
The partnership civil bytyokd. cz, that the new conditions of rent described as "incorrectas indecent and," recomienda the tenants not to sign the new contracts and that esperen until 7 december, the date on which publicará a guide informando on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the man as just a ademán.
"Each which says one thing," says with bad side.
Ostrava is convirtiendo in a great laboratory tests of the liberalización.
After year new happen with the great majority of the pisos that, in the czech republic, were until the moment under a rent regulado.
That is why, aktuálně. cz was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The waiting room mining rpg is one of the four of ostrava and, on tuesday to nine, was already full.
Fair alongside the doors are the guardias of security and to its hand a machine to pick up number.
"Rent 2011," can leerse in a button luminoso of their screen táctil.
The pulsarlo, leaves the machine a papelito with a number.
Almost not gives time or to read "157" and the number already appears in the great screen situated in the top of the chamber.
In a second, estáis in the queue.
Shortly afterwards, comes a marriage of age avanzada to ask, but the muchedumbre of the house is not here for the new rents.
The majority of the people is usual to solve problems, as formerly: solicitudes of arrangements, issues of insurance and similares affairs.
The letters with the new rent llegarán in ostrava contracts to the buzones the tenants of the majority of the 44.000 pisos pertenecientes to rpg around mediados of november.
Rpg byty them proposes an increase in the letters of hiring of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 november it opens up a special stop at the centre of attention to the new rents customer.
"Has been operating a week, as well, which is starting" respond, after dudar brevemente, the workers who are in it when the customer is presented as a journalist.
The liberalización and the old pisos for mineros of bakala are the issues more delicados in the area.
Before the elections, because the original tried high and clear the vice - president of parliament, of ostrava, lubomír zaorálek, the čssd, and now are continually in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years after i would like to a new suelo."
"Nor i changed the maldito plato in bathing," is desahoga man mentioned in the introducción.
According to the workers, for the time come more than anything pensioners to check whether receive a descuento in rent if firman in time, as a special promises the supply of rpg.
Recibirán also half of the descuento on rent of february the restantes tenants who sign the new contract before 15 december.
However, the window of the "liberalización" mining certainly not logra disipar the avalancha of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers were here yesterday, preguntaron only by the rent in 2011 around of cuarenta or fifty people," estimated the empleada of the window.
Meanwhile, rpg proposes in the website and in their tablones make individual meetings on the contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not llegan to an agreement on the rent, must resolve the issue an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but of information on the only way to proceed possible and completely conforme to the law," warns rpg in its pages.
"Here is not going to juzgar nobody," one of the empleadas view of rpg byty and a man who is in the street against the centre of attention to the customer gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"Recibo a pensión 13.000 and i are 5.000 for food; i have no means to go to the courts, says.
But, immediately, the empleada siembra the doubt.
"Already veremos."
"Mr zaorálek avisa them in the media that not sign, so perhaps the people espere," opinion.
The regulation of rent dejará exist in the majority of the czech republic to beginning of 2011 and, according to rpg byty, its economic increase is a need.
"The current rent still not cubren or even the cuantías necessary for the maintenance of the fund of the community," recalls pavel klimeš, director of the residencial portfolio of the company rpg byty, which adds to the descuidado state of the community enfada to fund the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While that during the five years transcurrieron between 2005 and 2010 rpg could with the rents invest in apartments four thousand million, in the four years that iran of 2011 to 2014 the figure will rise to 5.200 million.
The great screen that cuelga of techo, against the seats of the waiting room, now repite some data that resaltan in red.
"The increase the rent in the year 2011 15% and less aplica to 31.200 flats, is to say, more than 90% of the propiedades rpg."
"In addition, will always be a maximum 7,50 czk monthly by metre cuadrado," to be indicated on the screen.
Only a 38% increase in the lease of 400 pisos of rpg portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from cantidades extremely bajas, of 19,66 kroner by metre cuadrado," indicates rpg.
In 2.600 pisos, rent permanecerá invariable next year.
Rpg byty promises that the liberalización not afectará coup to rents, but that escalará between four to eight years.
In addition, add the following compromise: the company invertirá all the money of the subida the rent (consulte gráfico) again in the pisos, mainly in savings in calefacción: new windows and calefacción.
Priority will have the people who sign the agreement of subida rent.
The architects have understood that the offices will also need children
The edificio administrativo avriopoint in brno is the new headquarters of the company arch. design.
Nobody would say that also betrays a small crèche with everything in its internal itself to such instalaciones: walls of colores, muebles creativos and even a park in miniatura heaters outside.
Since october last year, it can go to the children of employees of arch. design.
The company of projects arquitectónicos arch. design, whose study salieron many buildings known brno, pensó since the first bocetos of the edificio avriopoint in include an area for their miniguardería.
In the company working around 90 people, mainly in the age of baby boom and querían allow that the arquitectas and delineantes pudieran return to work after the maternidad soon.
Together with the possibility of disfrutar of a timetable reduced, childcare is one of the benefits that it offers arch. design in its social workers in the framework of its programme.
The constructoras and arquitectas in this way have the possibility of combinar a profession demanding with the care of children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the employees of arch themselves. designu and, with the support of the direction, managed to obtain funding of the european union and the ministry of work and social affairs.
The miniguardería the company is financia through the european social fund in the framework of the operational programme of human resources and employment, as well as the state budget of the czech republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a dotación of more than eur 2.8 million czk) could buy the equipamiento and, after two years, contratar cualificado staff and services.
When agote funding (two years), the company arch. design has the obligación maintain in operation miniguardería with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of the draft lasted a year and in the presentation of the request of funding contributed the economy rating company.
The attention of children is in the hands of staff cualificado; in addition, are present the whole day for their care a enfermera and a teacher of the ministry of education. the nursery currently welcomes children without limit of age, although the majority of them has less than three years.
Given that this is a "miniguardería," as only can acoger simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the turnos acuden more during the day.
The functioning of the childcare is flexible for adaptarse to the needs of the parents and children of all the workers have the same right to use the crèche, regardless of the jerarquía within the company.
Although this is a lesson and individual care, the content of the programme of the miniguardería are comparables programme of education preescolar usual.
In her children not only juegan, but that also receive a quality education: from the learning básico until the preparation for the school, enseñan to english.
The available not only of juguetes and class of table, but also of a computer games for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself create an environment amigable and positive.
The parents can go to see their children at any time and evitan the stress to collect evening to the children of the college when is far from their place of work.
As well, the parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this genere naturally a of lealtad relationship between the worker and its empleador.
In this way, arch. design sitúa between businesses firman that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support to the family and, in short, this programme reforzó the marketing of staff.
The house of the huesos continues observen the home of gaudí fascinando after 100 years.
The court appears to the lomo a lagarto prehistórico, the escaleras reminiscent of the columna of a dinosaurio and the balcones seem the boca of a pez open.
That is the house batlló, in barcelona, in the arquitecto catalan antoni gaudí.
Due to its similar form a esqueleto, the local apodaron "the house of the huesos."
Their forms orgánicas, colores llamativos, the use novedosa of stone, the fragmentos azulejos and mosaicos, a façade that recalls the escamas and the omnipresentes lines suavemente curvadas, all this is típico the secesión of antoni gaudí.
The portada of the house plays with oníricas lines, colores delicados and texturas sacadas of the nature and the fauna.
Prestando more attention, a certain geometría notes, pace and a carefully thought order.
For the evening, all the façade of the house seems even more impressive, because it is iluminada of such a way that the mejore the brillo of colores.
Serpentea and the torsión of forms we still sorprendiendo in their home.
Wood ondulada copia the marcos windows, the barandillas, the adornos the doors, mirillas and the letreros.
The batlló home, which is in the neighbourhood of eixample in the number 43 of the trade animada street passeig of grácia, arose of the remodelación of a house of the year 1877 the arquitecto emilio chamber cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house will be completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial josep batlló, inicialmente insisted in derribar the previous edificio and start to zero, but soon accepted the idea of gaudí to make a reconstruction novedosa and more barata.
However, the house batlló, consisting of various flats, not the designed antoni gaudí only.
Colaboró in the design arquitecto josep maría jujol.
In fact, in their planos of the draft surgieron adornos for the apartment representativo the owner of the property and the mosaicos used in the façade.
In the façade also workers other creadores and artists.
The cooperation in the proposals of the house batlló was the start of the successful cooperation jujol with gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house milá and the güell of gaudí park, which has been found in the other parts of the same.
Due to its organic form, the local little after its finalización the apodaron "house of the huesos."
Other specific, due to the mechanism of opening up of the windows began to llamarla "house of the bostezos."
It also says that, in the top of the construction, appears espada of san jorge, patrón cataluña.
Other elements escultóricos of the construction esconden religious reasons.
Gaudí cast in the house a single system for the time of calefacción central with respiraderos of ventilación and the chimeneas typical.
Can resultar extraña its inclinación of cuarenta and five degrees.
During the construction, gaudí does not respetó in all the rules of construction of the time and not left influence for them.
Even so, the corresponding construction obtained permission from the outset, although of course in the indicados data on the reconstruction planned were so vague that, two years later, to its finalización, the city was so impactado with the result that asked to be corrigiese.
I molestaba, for example, that the construction incluyese columnas even the public acera.
The arrangements ever carried out, quite the contrary: so only fifteen days after the request of the city, josep batlló (requested and obtained) permission for renting two pisos higher in the edificio.
In the pisos inferiores instaló own owner.
In the gallery of the second floor was the salón and in the third floor dormitorios and the private part of the apartment.
The planta low alquiló to a joyería.
The house, six pisos, is completely atravesada by a escalera until the court "s heaters.
The basic elements of the reform consistieron in break all the ángulos and rectas, cubriéndolos lines of muros curvados.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connection in the area.
The common part can conectar completely abriendo the doors of the salones and a greater group can be comunicar in this way without problems, without which renuncie privacy necessary for talks more íntimas.
The house, with the reconstruction of gaudí, not only obtained a new façade, but also a roof inusual and two pisos adicionales.
It is also impressive how plays gaudí with the blue light, azulejos white and that cubren the courtyard internal and tragaluces.
The game with the two colores aporta the maximum of light in all the pisos of the house.
Is basó simply in the principle that the white reflects more light that the colores obscure, which on the contrary absorben the rays of sun.
Any person can visit the home batlló, that in the year 2005 was added to the list of patrimonio world humanidad of the unesco.
In the first floor of the house is the accesibles apartment more espacioso and more stretched to the public.
The dueños decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, with the occasion of the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famoso creator.
With the visits confirmaron, or discovered, that it is a very beneficioso business and ampliaron visits to the common area and to the buhardilla, including the terrace the roof.
The price of the entry into the monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16,50, although the students, pensioners and the titulares of cards turísticas get a 20% of descuento.
The amount supera considerably the price of the entry of other construcciones gaudí in the city.
If it wants to disfrutar of real environment the bed with their torres of lagarto, should be done quickly friend of some of the houses vecinas resident and visitarle at home.
How are escoge colchón and the somier: women and men seeking different things
Nothing of a pomposo framework for the bed; what really confiere their quality to a good bed is the area for tumbarse, namely the colchón and somier.
First of all must complementarse to the specific perfección for adapten to users.
During the election come into play numerous elements, including the weight, altura, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also the type of it is important in the sitúa colchón and the internal somier.
An example típico?
For example, in a weekend cabaña that does not usually have calefacción, not must utilizarse colchones of látex because "calientan" more lentamente.
Moreover, often though considerably more than the usual colchones of poliuretano.
Therefore, it is necessary darles return more frecuentemente.
If not airean debidamente the channels of the centre and, above, are on a firm basis, mantienen within the humedad. even can appear moho below.
At the time of choose a bed, also influyen the habits.
Who has spent much time abroad, often uses a colchón very high with a layer blanda and will have problems to feel well in an area more low and hard.
"Hockey almost all the players that once again of the nhl quejaban here not dormían as well."
"For their machacados shoulders, talones and caderas necesitaban colchones with a blanda layer of viscoelástica."
"This kind of colchones recomiendan also to people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so that receive wrong information of the articulaciones and skin," explains sylva hadamcziková, that is especializa in the mobiliario acolchado.
Many hockey players, like other customers, lead time preferring the colchones viscoelástica.
"Today there is no problem, because have these adecuados tempur czech and the italians magniflex, but also the mark tropico."
There is no longer be a player in the nhl to apreciar viscoelástica.
This "miracle" of a very sencillo works.
Optimiza its rigidez and form in the heat absorbido or adapta to its role heat corporal.
Ejerce pressure; during the night, nothing will vueltas as after a hard party.
Simply, duerme better.
The viscoelástica also works such as protection against the llagas.
The escoger the size of the colchón, añada to their altura the length of their feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a altura of around eur 180 cm need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The anchura minimum for a person should be, in a room double, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of the individual rooms, for example, solteros, recomienda as minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
For that a possible visit also is cómoda.
"If not, may apply the rule sencilla for calcular the breadth: the tumbarse boca above, should have the hands cómodamente encogidas towards the codos," aconseja the ingeniera helena prokopová, experta of cechu čalouníků dekoratérů, which already has for many years ocupándose of the problem of the dream saludable and of the ergonomía the mobiliario, issue teaching in schools especializadas.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own somier and colchón, as well that there is that during the purchase prestar attention to combinar the altura of the colchones.
In case contrary, will be necessary montar somieres different alturas, which is not always possible in all the camas.
The colchones espuma should have a altura minimum of 14 cm, the internal muelles models with a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centímetro are for the layer adapta to the forms and suaviza.
"The tocarlo with hand or the acomodarse in the colchón, certainly not should notarse the muelles," warns helena prokopová.
Each colchón requires a kind of somier determinado.
The dormitorios completely acolchados, in which the colchón and basis are as siameses, have no sense in the dormitorio.
The colchones respiran wrong and cannot be lavar its funda, which is often today.
And, given that every evening transpiramos between 0.2 and 0,75 l of sudor, it is clear that after some five or seven years the colchón will start to recordarnos a great (and congestionado) tamiz.
For this reason, the specialists reject the eslóganes who speak of a life of the colchón of up to 25 years, or even of a guarantee for life.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a council: in the colchones with a breadth of 120 or 140 cm, ocúpese carefully the limpieza and the lavado of the funda, but better añada a protector of colchón can withdraw and lavar easily.
Although currently fabrican fundas of colchones with closure of cremallera in all its perímetro, so that the abrirlas fall into two parts (something very important for the lavado and the size of the lavadora!), its manipulation in the models of greater size (and by a single person) the levantar the colchón may seem a fight between a weight mosca and a heavy weight.
In the bed, instead of a somier, has a table firm?
Never!
As much to the camas designed to pass a night visits.
However, must make (if not the tienes ventilación) orificios already on the table and must utilizarse with a colchón muelles in the home and a altura minimum of 15 cm with the muelles in stock exchanges (as the german taschenfederkern) and a layer blanda.
The colchones poliuretano not must utilizarse on such bases.
For the somieres láminas not articulables and that contengan between 14 and 18 láminas, can be used colchones látex or colchones sándwich (for example, a combinación látex and fibra of coco), although it is always better a somier with a greater number of láminas, 28 or more, in which the láminas of the area lumbar are reforzadas and can regulate its rigidez.
The somieres láminas articulables not must utilizarse with a colchón muelles, since not reacciona to the reclinación.
In addition to the ajuste of the rigidez of the láminas, it can also use the protection of shoulders.
It is a special fijación of the láminas which allows presionar or, even inclinar the láminas of such a way that "rodeen" perfectly the shoulders during the dream.
For the men who have shoulders very anchos, this is something very important.
Even acuerdan of them colchones manufacturers that, in the "masculinos," began to use a more blanda precisely area around the shoulders.
It also acuerdan of women, for which a more blanda area on the caderas.
For the customers more demanding, there are somieres with structure in or tablillas cross the so - called amortiguación multitorsión.
The pressure is distributed between different points and rebaja the tension.
Must also bear in mind that, although used the colchón and somier adecuados, if used a bad almohada (and great "mullida"), desaparecerán the majority of the advantages.
The rule básico is sencilla: the almohada must sustain the head and corner can only come to the shoulders, on which can be relajar músculos of the same.
The right size recomendado is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in escandinavia.
The tumbarse of hand, the almohada must be at the same level (when it combina with the somier refuerzo for shoulders or the more blanda area of the colchón) that the altura of the shoulders.
The colchones modern have something to do, as it seems, with the original colchones rellenos of paja.
Manufacturers are using, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mezclas.
In fact, are fashionable the colchones biológicos.
The materias primas basis of oil, with the fabrica the espuma of poliuretano, rellenan with natural aceites, for example, of ricino or soja.
In fact, practically all manufacturers known emplean soja.
Biological ," in the case of the colchones, wants to say that the centre is fabricado only of materials of natural origin," explains petr vašíček of the company tropico plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the funda of the colchones, one of the first aloe vera.
But also can be optar by the microcápsulas, that liberan a fresh aroma forest or lavanda.
There are also differences for men and women.
While the men "refrescan" with extractos vegetales of brisa, so that the funda of the colchón absorba the heat and refresque body, women prefieren "calentar" the funda.
The extracto of bluefin pimiento mejora the movement of blood, so that women are more calidez.
Does the favoritos currently?
The colchones manufactured espuma fría, which are more porosos, with a structure of cells adapted, which makes that are more permeables that the poliuretano normal and ofrezcan more permeabilidad.
The combinación of diversas rigideces of espuma fría and viscoelástica allow fabricar colchones of diversas areas which you know perfectly where is the top, shoulders and the talones.
A colchón of good quality costará sek seven thousand to above.
Those who play a role terapéutica tend to have a lower vat, because that are considered as means sanitarios.
The first that obtained this advantage in the czech republic was gumotex.
It is complicated savings in the colchones and somieres.
Sometimes we can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, which on occasions offer two colchones by the price of one.
For example, the mark magniflex provides colchones duofreeze with a espuma memory memory adherida to the funda by 11.990 kroner.
The second is achieved gratuitamente.
The era of the viscoelástica with a celular open structure and a great density started with the material "cósmico" of tempur.
Inicialmente arose as material for the nasa, because during the despegues loas astronautas is veían sometidos to a huge sobrecarga.
Tempur ablanda with the heat and endurece with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, cálido, ejerce a perfect and adapta effect óptimamente its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal in order to prevent produzcan llagas, but also to improve the comfort during the dream.
The espuma viscoelástica not only be used in the colchones, but also for products sanitarios, for example for almohadas that colocan under the legs and the alivian, as well as their movement.
National manufacturers, for example, used the espuma eucatherm c or twinsaver and similares.
Increasingly parents emplean devices of monitoring of people to control their children
The fear for the children leads to increasingly people to think in controlarles by gps.
The system, inicialmente thought for the monitoring of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute as well, for example, in case such as the disappearance of the girl child of nine years anička janatková.
At the moment the facility has the size of around a box of cerillas, but soon reduce the size of a clock.
To many people gave fear the case of the desaparecida anička and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invadir their privacy.
"All intentamos tell us that it is not espiar, but of other means to disminuir the possibilities of produzca a tragedy," considers petr pilin of the company macro weil, one of the providers of devices to follow in the czech market.
"Reconozco that, in certain cases, can be abusar of such devices, for example if they meten in the bolso of someone without their conocimiento, but we have not yet topado with such cases."
"The majority of the customers really what compran for reasons of security," adds pilin.
In its opinion, children should always know to what is the "cajita" and how is used in the event of emergency.
The psicóloga child dana bočková warns on the fact that, if the child does not want to llevarlo, simply tirará.
"Even smaller children show great creatividad at the time of losing intentionally determinadas things if you want to prevent them controlen."
"Before, the parents confiaban enormemente in the mobile, but these could apagar as easily as the system of monitoring, says bočková.
In its opinion, it is discutible if in case of attack this device is really useful.
"If there is a kidnapping prepared, the author almost always comprobará if the child leads some kind of electronic device which can desvelar their location."
"It is now the telephone."
"According to go extendiendo the use of the devices of monitoring, also the buscará, since their sale without doubt will be carried out with great advertising.."
"In such cases, the criminals always go a step ahead of the police," says the psicóloga.
However, adds that such devices can help in the case of an attack improvisado of a pedófilo.
According to the company rc robert čech monitoring monitoring, which provides services both for vehicles and for people, even in the event of that, following an attack, destruya immediately the device of monitoring, their presence can serve aid.
"Can be configurar device to envíe regularly position after a determinado period."
"If suffers damage, at least facilitará the final position of the person in question."
"The more expensive devices have been integrated a medidor inclinación, so that if the person simply resbala and is still, the emitirá immediately a warning mechanism with the position in question, says čech.
In its opinion, a service of this kind can obtenerse even with the mobile phones intelligent navigation, in which only must instalarse a special software.
The problem of the current units of monitoring is that at the moment, it is with a size similar devices to a box of cerillas or less mobile telephones size.
Therefore, can perderse.
According to pilin of macro weil, for that reason are currently carrying out tests with that parezcan a clock digital devices.
"In addition, will have the advantage añadida that a possible agresor perhaps not identifique mechanism."
"Or that the identifique after some time, which can do that the police gane time," adds.
Although the devices of monitoring is lleven in the muñeca or colgando, seguirán using the same technology used for the monitoring of vehicles.
It is the comprobación of the position with a gps system (that is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the role of a mobile phone that comunica the current position.
The army has enough mechas to rodear all but only duran two years chequia.
The army czech bought 445 kilometres of mecha for prender explosivos.
Already last year the ministry of defence added to its arsenal 224 kilometres of mecha.
Therefore, have existencias for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is two years, four sumo.
The army bought the stv group, to mecha for explosivos. s. by cuarenta billions of kroner.
The staff of the general responded to mf dnes justifying the purchase of a so enormous amount of mecha by saying that the soldiers need for the manoeuvres of training 60 kilometres of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the pirotécnicos of the army, which was in contact with mf dnes decides however that, in this case, should make these manoeuvres with frequent use of explosivos each year also all the official general, high - mando, and even secretarias and limpiadoras.
Not querían exentos or the defence minister alexandr vondr and the captain of the army vlastimil picek.
Only it could justify that the army gaste sesenta kilometres of mecha.
Such length equivale to 25.000 explosiones.
Although this outside, the army would have existencias sufficient for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres of mecha, the army would with new purchase (even adding the consumption of special units of engineers or) existencias sufficient for the 225 indicados earlier.
The soldiers of the brigada of rapid intervention quejaron personalmente recently to the minister vondra because they say that hardly have munición for diversas weapons, so that is limitan even the prácticas of stone by question of money.
And not hablemos on the lack of underwear.
"I nor logro understand that we compren repeatedly such cantidades of mecha."
"But it is their decision and, without doubt, sabrán why actúan."
"For us, the army is a good customer at that, as company, intentamos meet" commercial, admits the director of stv group, jan děcký.
The spokesman of the ministry of defence jan pejšek defiende the hundreds of kilometres of mecha also saying that will take existencias this "munición" at least for ten years.
However, jan děcký, stv group, indicates that the mecha so only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of the products pirotécnicos for the army or the police, two years.
"If conditions are stored in a perfect, can take until four," says one of the soldiers who, by the possible criticism of the army, does not give its name.
After the finalización of its useful life, each munición must comprobarse carefully to see if remains fiable and not perjudicará the soldiers.
But these tests are not gratuitas and requieren an investment adicional.
Another argument of the ministry is that, to buy 445 kilometres of mecha, obtained a descuento.
"We are costaron a 60% less than the asked last year 244 kilometres," indicates the spokesman pejšek the centre of purchases of the ministry of defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of mecha of the pirotécnicos the police, which eliminan the munición of the second world war or the dejada by the soviético army, not supera since the 1.500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always calls for only the amount justa as to agotar the munición before the end of its useful life.
We decided for reasons of security for the pirotécnicos and, furthermore, while we can achieve types mecha more modern and fiables.
The ministry already has claras difficulties for conclusion tens of thousands of tonnes of munición for the time of the warsaw pact, when the army checoslovaco of two hundred thousand people preparaba for a campaign in the rin.
According to the pirotécnicos with those who spoke mf dnes, following a couple of years producirá the following problem with the current: there will be that eliminar hundreds of kilometres of mecha old, which is comprando now "barata."

The police realizó arrestos during an auction public in the edificio the agrícola fund, in pilsen
The police against the corruption realizó various arrestos fund in the edificio agrícola in recent days.
The detectives esposaron a businessman local media in the sector and the real estate entrepreneur luboš g.
According to think, this attempt manipular ongoing public an auction for the restitution of the rights of such a way that the ground subastado recibiese a interesado precise.
Should pagarle for this to luboš g. the sek million.
"By the time so i can say that the police seeks only to a person for soborno during an auction public and public tendering," said to právo the head of the prosecutor - general of pilsen antonie zelená, adding that at the moment cannot divulgar more details on the ongoing research.
After veinticuatro hours, the police soltó employer of 46 years.
On the way in which was able to influence in the official auction public, given the little information, as only can be especular.
The spokesman of the fund agrícola lubomíra černá responded to the questions of právo by saying that the police took out the arrest in the seat of pilsen and was really public during an auction.
"It is a client, not one of our workers," specified.
According to černá, the public is called "convocatoria auction for the presentation of proposals transferencia of terrenos accordance with the law on the earth" and carried out when there are several stakeholders in relation to the field ofrecido.
"These people, during the convocatoria, offer a higher value to their return, which must be transferido before that anuncie the value of the ground."

Luboš g. had information on who was to present to the convocatoria and, given that the time is person interested because adquirió various rights restitution, proposed to the interested in the field that not participaría in the auction.

Luboš had special contactos g. in the pilsen fund for a long time.
Figuraba in the cause of the former head of the pf václav sankot, which was accused by despachar the replacement of terrenos for the construction which had already been emitido a decision.
For example, luboš g. just to obtain from the fund terrenos envisaged for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where it should build a great industrial road to the area of borská pole.
After, the cambió very beneficiosa with the magistrado by a home in the historic centre of the city itself with a very higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the terrenos blocked evitarían construction.
The families have to pay a expenditure adicionales several hundreds of kroner per month
The hogares will have to pay from january not only for all the types of energy, but also for water and electricity, complementos calefacción and, in some cases, rent greater.
Therefore, the families will have to draw the portfolio, from january, several centenares of kroner per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases in a 4.6%, the gas around a 2%, in some cities have to pay up to a 10% more for the supply of water and also many increase the price of the central calefacción.
The subida of electricity to the families that live in apartments should ascender to a 100 kroner per year rather than now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced prices, due to increasing the support to the production of renewable energy sources, in particular the fotovoltaica.
However, the gas encarece moderadamente, especially in the time that more used the calefacción and, therefore, greater is the consumption.
In this case, also must have a couple of hundreds of kroner more per year.
While the electricity and gas is encarecen across the country, the change of price of the central calefacción varía from one place to another.
The subida of the planifica mainly the greater municipality prices.
For example, the hogares of pardubice or hradec králové pay since january by the central calefacción 50 more crowns per month, while the families of liberec pay more sek 1 adicionales per year.
The residents in prague also must soportar a 9% increase in the price of water and the calefacción, especially in the event that the city aumente rent of infrastructure.
If the rent not varía, the praguenses pay a 6.8% adicional.
Prices in prague, however, seguirán be among the lowest of all the country.
In northern bohemia, where the current prices are between the highest, both charges encarecerán a 7,4%.
Can increase considerably the prices of rent 450.000 pisos alquilados in prague, where the regulation finalizará in january.
For example, the company cpi byty, which has in ústí nad labem around 2.5 pisos, increase the rent since january in until a 100%.
The company llevará to the courts to those who are not agree with the new rent.
The regulados rents, that benefician to residents of around 300 000 pisos, could increase next year to a 10%.
The young czechs emborrachan with fernet and ron. the beer is not so, because a effect lentamente
Fernet, ron, vodka and even whiskeys good robados their parents.
These are the drinks that provocan that young acaben in medical care bebedores with a lower age to fifteen years.
The children who have just tumbados in the hospital continually to overcome the resaca already are not an exception.
This is deriva the experience of the doctors who are with such cases in the admisiones of pediatría the hospital.
"Beber beer or wine is not fashionable, because tardan much in emborracharles."
"The fashionable now are the drinks alcohólicas strong," indicates to právo the head of pediatría the hospital hořovice in the centre of bohemia, luděk pelikán.
"When logran cogerle a bottle his father of the alacena, can be whisky, but normally is fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of aligera with zumo and that not huele both," explains.
We also confirms the spokesman of the university hospital motol, eva jurinová.
"Normally, often dealt fernet or ron."
"These are the drinks alcohólicas modernas," in particular between the school.
"In some cases, used aguardiente that cogieron at home," adds jurinová.
According to the head pelikán, are bebedores of thirteen and catorce years which often appear in the hospitals.
Before hořovice, where working from this year, worked during a decade in the pediatría motol, where the ambulancias led to young people from the cercanas areas.
"A girl had to ingresar perhaps four times."
"Began to twelve years, when the trajeron with 3.5 on blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture with éxtasis," indicates the doctor of department on this case.
"Was the fair holešovice in some festival of dance."
"What is interesting is that its mother nor i sorprendió that your daughter desapareciese 48 hours," we are surprised at the head.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or even their clear tolerancia towards the bebida on the part of their children which is considered the main cause of the increase the consumption of alcohol between young people.
The experts señalan that, in the case of children, we cannot speak propiamente of dependence.
"Is meant by alcohólico to a person who has a chronic dependence of alcohol for several years, with all the associated with the same phenomena, which is not produced in children."
"In aquéllos that beben alcohol repeatedly, more must be of a social environment or familiar sistemáticamente failed," explains the head pelikán.
According to the spokesperson jurinová, this year in the pediátrica clinic in motol hospitalizaron until mediados of november cuarenta children drunk.
However, the statistics show that acuden with only a intoxicación serious and must remain in the hospital.
Young people bebedores that, following the recognition doctor, will be travelling home with the parents or the police, not count.
In addition to the cases in which children are simply meet after school and beben aguardiente, for pelikán there are three altibajos estacionales that cabe mencionar: the day of brujas, order of the year and the end of course school.
"In such circunstancia, beben by the malas notes or, on the contrary, celebran the start of the holiday."
"In the day of the brujas have come to see in admisiones until seven children drunk at the same time," adds pelikán.
The bebedores that pasan night in desintoxicación under the supervisión of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day not sufren a terrible resaca at home.
The pain of head matinal, provocado by the deshidratación and the lack of glucosa, evita with the injection of a suero glucosa and with the nutrientes missing the body.
"They have been much better, because after the agitada evening, levantan well and it pains them nothing."
"Only show confusos on where they are," señala pelikán, adding that, often, patients pierden the good humour at least when are the costs that have generado.
The transfer ambulancia and the hospitalización in a room for patients serious comes to cost a decena sek of thousands.
"Often i used the cost as a means of educarles, when the visit i say directly to children how much has cost your embriaguez and that would have to move all the summer in a job to young people to ganaras enough to pagarse this evening," adds pelikán.
The sure doctor, in its opinion perhaps as measure regresiva, that devolverle often people the costs of treatment, not in the case of children who beben.
Two aircraft l - 159 are for the first time in the hands ajenas in spain
Two aircraft l - 159 a total of five, for which the czech ministry of defence sustituyó aircraft home c - 295m, partieron tuesday to seville, where is the fabricante of the aeronaves home - eads.
This is the first time that a mechanism of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the czech army.
At the moment, only were abroad in order to make prácticas flights or demonstration.
This is the version biplaza l - czech 159t1, until the time used the army and that was in state fly yet.
The three aircraft restantes are the monoplaza l - 159.
They are still retain in aer vodochody and the intermediario the sale, the company omnipol, already been made of them the last week.
Jan peješk, from the press department of defence, indicates that are not yet know when retirarán aircraft físicamente of vodochody.
"Aircraft monoplaza l - 159, instead, were separados of aircraft reparados time, without investment or contributions adicionales by part of the ministry."
"The biplaza l - 159t1 intercambiaron in its current state," said to právo pejšek.
Added that the army is not without biplaza aircraft, since in may 2009 the army signed with aer vodochody a contract for a cuantía sek 200 million for the construction of four l - 159 unnecessary for biplazas devices.
One of the new aircraft already received the army in july, the other entregará at the end of the year.
According to pejšek, eads comprometió to that aircraft is añadan at equipamiento of some countries allies.
"In the contract indicates clearly that the company eads is which cut aircraft l - 159 and that servirán for the prácticas of pilotos countries of the otan."
"Therefore depends on the buyer will decide how utilizarlos in this framework," señala pejšek.
The newspaper hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the spanish army is not interesado in the l - 159.
The exchange of five l - 159 by a home and the purchase of other three aeronaves aircraft by 3.500 billions of kroner were aprobados last year by the government of mirek topolánek.
The ministry of defence not convocó a tender for the purchase and negoció directly with eads.
The current defence says that the exchange promueve direction the future of l - 159 export abroad.
The czech adquirió army to aer 72 aeronaves and so only used 24, by what it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft home possibly come to have legal consequences.
The european commission already denounced the ministry of defence czech before the european court of justice because should escoger aircraft carrying out a european tendering and not poniéndose in contact with a single fabricante.
The army already received three aircraft home and the last should reach the airport praguense of kbely in catorce days.

Therefore, the dedo could help to determine what men should someterse a test of próstata cancer, in particular if this característica is going asociada to a risk genético or other factores perjudiciales family, as health problems, according to eeles indicates.
During the period 1994 - 2009, realizó monitoring with a british homólogo of more than 1.500 patients with cancer próstata and, simultaneously, 3.000 men sanos.
More than half of the participants in the study was the dedo índica more short of the hand right the cancel.
Presentaban the same likely to suffer próstata cancer that 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a more long that the dedo cancel rate, this risk is reducía in a 33%; for the men aged inferiores to 60% reduction reached the 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the period prenatal, reflects different levels of hormonas that is expuesto the feto in the matriz.
A lower level of testosterona up with a more long rate.
Studies previous indicated that testosterona influences in the development of the próstata cancer.
The great genetista czech and former president of the academy of ciencias, professor václav pačes, said to čtk who knows the study, but that does not believe that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "show completely."

The university of the helado
In the "gelato university" in bologna preparing heladeros in the best times of the year.
The course básico of three days for future heladeros has the highest afluencia and visitantes throughout the world.
In reality of where has all the helado?
The gelatiere and of gelataio.
The gelatiere elabora the italian crema according to all the rules of the art of the drafting of helados.
The gelataio saca with a espátula the crema helado the mostrador, extends on the barquillo and sold.
To know this, not lack go to anzola dell "emilia in the province of bologna.
But who wants to know more about helados, should not visit the "gelato university" of the italian carpigiani company.
The fabricante has equipado the university of the helado with the congeladora in the year 2003, so that the crema the helado of their machines cumpla high ideales italians in all parts.
The course básico of three days for future heladeros has the highest afluencia and visitantes throughout the world.
Also there is more special courses of more days on the helado chocolate and prácticas in the heladería of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some sueñan with a new professional career, other risk in the suave helado their vague deseos.
This time are 40 participants 19 countries of all the continentes, from brazil to arabia saudí pasando by hungary.
To jacky, teacher of this art of california, i love the lento movement of food and in the future wants to offer a european quality in the land of the helado industrial product.
Anke, berlin, is asesora of companies and wants to create something in some years within a work enervante itself.
Two young egyptians sueñan with open a heladería in cairo.
A man of malta and another brazil want to improve the quality of the helados their bares, and a ama of canadian home, julie, next because their children are encantan the helados italians.
The master heladero luciano ferrari explains the participants subsequently the cualidades ideales of helado perfect.
It is crucial not only its good taste, but also suavidad sedosa and its good consistencia.
Luciano not olvida their training or the covered nata of the house national higher and mainly in the south of the country: "the italian helado is simply the best, and that is why each bola has something romántico."
The first step to the drafting seems facilísimo.
Luciano echa the basic ingredientes: milk, nata, milk powder, sugar and estabilizadores in a great batidora, that calienta all with an electronic programme until 85 degrees and at the moment enfría until four degrees.
Then opens the grifo the machine and is a basic crema white pasteurizada, the basis for all the types of helados milk.
Suddenly, the professor question: can the crema of helado elaborarse only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can we give rienda suelta some want to experience?
Luciano aconseja despisten trends of the time.
The talk of helado "natural," not only of ingredientes at best has used estabilizadores, mainly a natural product, probably goma guar, frijol guar.
Of course that we can draw up helado without estabilizador, only be comprarlo a day, colocarlo in a stock exchange and the customer morderá a sonoro helado of granito.
We allow certain basic variaciones in the mass.
Is emplean aromas.
With regard to the helado, the master luciano distinguishes between the ingredientes the compran in the section of fruit or in the dulces of the supermarket.
Moreover, there is polvos and pastas.
"All suppliers intentarán colar ingredientes aromatizados in its mercancía."
"But must experience some time."
Whether with sorbetes fruit with sugar and fruit frescas.
Or even with the crema helado of basic mass white, that huevos volverá a crema yellow and with cacao in dust as a basis for all the possible placeres chocolate.
Now the participants in the course can use the heladoras.
Luciano leaves them draw up every time four different rates of helado of vainilla, chocolate, moca and avellana, with or without huevos in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vainilla or other natural ingredientes.
Do the same experiment with types of helado fruit.
Who knows best depends not necessarily that takes more aroma tofe or more puré of fruit.
It is not necessary that the helado avellanas sepa to frutos secos, if contains more avellanas.
The group of work elabora adorado helado of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and something less of estabilizador.
First a mixture equilibrada resalta the taste of the helado, says luciano.
The drafting of helados is a problem of artimética: it employs the puré of melocotón with much sugar, there is that rebajar the proportion of sugar for the basic receta.
For the helado of limón lack an extra porción of sugar.
Luciano saca a utensilio with which sets the amount of sugar for the types of fruit (measurement of the vinicultor for oechsle in the mosto of uva).
Afortunadamente tables facilitan the account.
Draft helado not requires more than the application física, as before.
Not only the utensilio aid for the drafting automática of basic mass.
Also there is a utensilio, in the bate simultaneously the blending of helado prepared and enfría temperatura under zero.
In spite of all, all the automatización falls outside in regard to the small pasta.
The brazilian gustavo channel itself and to their colleagues from the top down with puré of fruit, as if it were a miniprimer giant without control.
"In all the courses," says the master luciano, "it is only a question of time that something as well."
Inspectores in a situation complicada
The european autoridad of security of food efsa has been infiltrado in the industry that experimenta with plantas transgénicas.
This issue formula currently the group of experts testbiotech, which is considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of the biotecnología.
"It appears a theory conspiración but not what we have documentado well," said christoph then, director of testbiotech, on wednesday in munich.
Harry kuiper, the director of the group of experts on efsa on plantas genéticamente modificadas, and another efsa also expert, they are contratados for years in the ilsi partnership.
The consorcios as monsanto, nestle or bayer costean.
Kuiper has worked so significant in the rules of comprobación efsa of plantas genéticamente modificadas, what i sitúa in a clear conflicto of interests, critica then.
The provisions of efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms the documentation of the situation ilsi and imitan the writing of the company, which in reality is controlada by their italian authorities in parma.
This is the second time that testbiotech critica a conflict of interests.
Thus, recently, a manager of high rango of efsa was without the support or the time of transition to the suiza agrarkonzern syngenta, and that has changed with its bando.
Recently, also mitteldeutsche rundfunk (mdr) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the eu and the industry, which made the oficinal general of the environment as well as an clarividente parliamentary of the eu.
However, efsa cannot recognise any conflicto of interests.
It recurre to all the data formal, also to some of the industry, provided that are of a high and technical quality, ordering in a report.
It does not requires the experts who work in efsa that does not have any contact with the industry.
But must exponer these contactos.
Kuiper admits his work for the international life sciences institute (ilsi) in the united states.
It denomina itself as a neutral forum for the experts and science, the industry and the policy, among others for the assessment of risk for the biotecnología without the task of lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, as then, criticise that are currently permitan plantas transgénicas without investigate the food for animals and that is not compruebe the influence of the plantas genéticamente modificadas in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, the maíz genéticamente modificado in agriculture, says then.
The current practice is to verify unicamente proteinas aisladas, but not the planta transgénica whole, which offers no results fiables.
"If they are not seeking the risks, how will find?," question acusador, then.
Angelina hilbeck view of the same way.
The scientific investiga since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and currently working in the technical of zurich institute.
In this area, the industry tries to increasingly, in the usa and in europe, influence or desacreditar critical to the scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists that are not influenciados by consorcios.
For businesses, the studies critical is not published by general rule.
"The controls the research industry of the security," maintains hilbeck.

Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the greatest disaster medioambiental of the usa, the president barack obama had admitted new drilling in the west part of the gulf of méjico under pressure of the opposition and the industry.
The partidarios querían disminuir the dependence of the new suministros of oil in the usa. abroad.
Until today has not been aclarado of all who is the responsibility of the irreparable marea black in the gulf.
In the centre of the criticism is the consortium british energy bp, which is enfrentado with millions of demandas.
A committee of inquiry encargada by obama will present its results in december.
In october, ken salazar, the interior minister, lifted the moratoria perforación following the explosión.
Subsequently, various consorcios peteroleros presented solicitudes for new intentos perforación.
Obama and salazar want descartar a new disaster using a more hard and safety regulations more stringent controls.
The autoridad control currently responsible, that after having been acusada charges of corruption has fallen into disrepute, is reform of raíz.
Obama announced way parallel cerrarán the gaps fiscales lucrative for the consorcios oil and gas.
The industry announced publicly that the total extracción in the gulf will be less thanks to a more strict regulation, to date.
"The plans of government are the greatest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the outcome of the current survey carried out by the company asesora bdo - before the ban on extracción on wednesday.
American energey alliance queja of the inseguridad in the sector: "nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The investments in new projects of extracción prolongan so soon, in detrimento of growth.
Ogonilandia is arruinada
The water of the ríos is márrón oil, huele as a gasolinera: millions of litres vertidos of crude oil have destroyed nature in the nigeriana ogonilandia.
The robo people live, the corruption and the trade ilegal of oil.
To celestine it seems akpobari well.
"Do not canséis," tranquiliza the activista medioambiental journalists: "today will go sufficient oil to vuestros" eyes.
The nigeriano of 37 years has managed to expose boys vadeando in water to the pecho with the brillo of luces reflejadas turbulence in the area: with the colorido brillo water, the scene seems almost bonita.
Not see that on the surface flotan manchas marrones of oil.
Before here cogía gambas to puñados, explains esther badom in the orilla of río bodo - jetty.
While, the aguas fluidas are completely muertas.
Five years ago vertió in the formidable humedal an impressive amount of oil by a tubería rota.
The peces the vicinity of the small town of bodo had to nadar six hours to reach aguas llenas peces: that, at the heart of the delta of the niger and located in ogonilandia, is seen as one of the regions more apestadas of the world.
In the way the recorrido the río that passes by manglares, the extensa desolación is obvia.
Instead of water, the motor of ship remueve a clear caldo marrón, who sumerja his hand in the water, sacará full of oil.
The raices of trees of the manglares elevan from the suelo as dark sticks of regaliz, tristemente aislan the palmeras that conflict and cuelgan their palmas.
In vano is seeking bandadas of pájaros, as if they were in the humedal as always: in as calla the barrier of foreign, expande in it a kind of calm fantasmal of a paraíso previous with olor gasolinera.
"What is happening here is a fight ecológica," says, huraño, celestine akpobari. "we live in constant danger to health."
Procede the comparison bélica.
The area of the settlement of the ogoni is a reñido field of batalla for years: here irrumpieron more than 60 years ago the first european exploradores, here is organizó first resistance in the years 80 with the writer ken saro - wiwa, later ejecutado here had to colocar its first factory the consortium shell in 1993, because it would be too peligroso for the employees of the oil.
Even today is banned the return of businesses ogonilandia: while bombeaban daily more than two million barrels of black gold throughout the region of the delta, of a size three times greater than suiza, with more than 5.000 sources of extracción and 7.000 kilometres of pipes, the fields petrolíferos in ogonilandia were reassured, the location is too inestable to the consortium.
Each 200 metres sobresalían plataformas of acero as estrafalarias esculturas water: "navidad arbolitos called cariñosamente the heads of the perforadoras.
Have up to 50 years, the majority have a corrosión total.
At the moment falla a cabezal, believes akpobari, then mana a chorro constant of oil in the water.
According to the valoraciones of the experts, have been vertido more than two thousand million litres 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: year after year, the amount of aceite penetra, as in the averia buque "exxon valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of alaska, one of the greatest catástrofes ecólogicas in the history of the humanidad.
Who is responsible for the duradera region medioambiental, lidiará with this.
While the consortium of shell and the robos organised of oil are responsible for more than 90% of pollution, the ecologistas see to the cabezales point of romperse and the pipes with fugas as the main causantes.
In nigeria, shell aplica mainly low estándares security normally in the world the conventional, reprochó the scientist richard steiner the consortium in 2008: only the índices of defectos the pipes are "on a múltiplo greater than in another place."
In a place, that from far seems to be forgotten, is a taller full of oil under the free sky, surgen figures of the manglares: are desnudos and cubiertos of oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes united the wells, sometimes arbitrarily esparcidos on the ground, flamea a fuego: a small ilegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil calienta in the fuego more hours, explains michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, petrol penetra through the pipes in the recipiente, later the tubería oil gotea and finalemente comes diésel.
In this way, michael and four employees producen daily until four barrels of diésel to 300 litres: "we aporta 34.000 naira," around usd 22.
The inhabitants of the delta advantage the shortage of fuel in one of the largest petrolíferos states of the áfrica black.
Nigeria only account with a single refineria.
With the absurdo and cheap price of diesel barely eur 40 - céntimo per litre illegal calentadores can offer still less: reduce the value of its raw material.
Comes "of the bunkers," that trucaron the network of pipes in ogonilandia: according to the experts, this step, pierden at least 16 million litres of oil a day in all the delta of the niger.
Only a negligible part of the provisional material premium almacenada refina clearly ilegal: the criminals organizadas networks, to which also belong politicians and high charges militares, are the best part in aljibes and venden cheap in the world market.
The activista akpobari considers purely académico the debate on whether the disaster medioambiental is rather due to the handling of the population or to the floja way of production.
"If the petroleras not comportaran as invasoras and did not entirely had destroyed by the natural hábitat of the peces, would not have sabotaje illegal, neither robos, nor refinerias."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destrozadas above all by shell until the point that only is a deducción the consortium: "perhaps it is better to submit another nacionalidad, such as china."
Michael puts nervous.
"It is still time that desaparezcáis," says the musculoso ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the unity of the army coge to the special refinadores illegal, are not threat with arrestarlos, if not a painful soborno.
The soldiers from north also want, as all the nigerianos, take advantage of the raw material.
"This condemned invento has done up to complete our country, says akpobari.
The researchers detectan defectos of peligrosos factory in motores the a380
Apparently, the a380 has a great problem of security.
In the research of a machine that realizó a forced landing, researchers hallaron a possible defecto factory, which can produce "a fallo catastrófico in the motor."

Thousands of people of luto by the mineros fallecidos
In new zelanda, more than 10.000 people thought in the mineros sepultados, which gave by fallecidos after many explosiones in a mina.
Todavia have not been able to find the cadáveres, because the security measures are still precarias in the place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago a intense explosión took place in the mina pike river near the city of greymouth.
29 mineros of ages between 17 and 62 were enterrados in the mina.
It introduced a probe in the place of the misfortune, but descubrió no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of gases toxic and successive explosiones, no rescue team could lower for reasons of security.
After the second intense detonación, the authorities and experts dedujeron that had not possibilities that the mineros had sobrevivido.
Have not been able to recover the cuerpos until the date.
Currently the family and friends reminiscent of the fallecidos with a acto conmemorativo.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplandeciente brillo the sun in greymouth in the neozelandesa island in the south.
Are silence for two minutes.
In tribute to the mineros sepultados, is colocaron 29 tables with the helmets, lámparas and nombres of the mineros.
Also had photographs and personal objetos, below items of clothing and tables surf.
The banderas ondearon average asta to the gubernamentales buildings in the country.
New zelanda esperó that the mineros volvieran to the area "of the profundidades of the earth," john key said, the president of the government neozelandés, with the participants of the acto conmemorativo.
"But never returned home."
Cannot take the death of his son until that has not seen his body, said lawrie drew, whose son zen was sepultado in the mina.

The devil, guerrero!
Does the gore encaja in the cinema artistic?
The director nicolas winding refn again explorar the fronteras the gender with their epopeya of batallas "walhalla rising."
What public will be thought the director danés nicolas winding refn the rolling "walhalla rising"?
A guerrero vikingo preso with one eye (mads mikkelsen) libera of their torturadores and to murderous enemies with almost sobrehumanas struggles, sounds ideal for viewers young people who are seeking sangrienta action, precisely because our héroe would like to use methods brutales to kill and start to their enemies the bull of cuerpos with life when bad humour.
Furthermore, unojo, as is called in reality, says almost no word throughout the film and the other characters leave carry by as much one or two sentences or a couple of penosos cries mortales.
In the opposite callan and gozan of the bonitos and terroríficos paisajes montuosos escocia, that the scenes offer the world vikingo of approximately thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for cineastas crecidos and interested in the existencialismo and movements of house very calmados.
When a film has several groups of destinatarios is a pity that we can descartar mutuamente.
The director winding refn considers its salvajes and to the trilogía on the peinado traficante of drugs "pusher" as a kind of danesa version of quentin tarantino, but refuses estoicamente to do that their works are for all the public with something more humour in the main stream or something less brutality of the house artística.
A mass brain and bite that brotan cannot deter the majority of the supporters of artistic film.
The majority of the fan of the action will die of aburrimiento, if unojo coge a ship to jerusalem with a tropa of misioneros cristioneros violentos for reasons interpretables and is atascado a eternidad in calm and the niebla before its team to america and vuelva callarse there.
It is a lástima that "walhalla rising" has not found distribuidora cinematográfica in germany and only publique in dvd.
It is a calamidad against the magníficas pictures, but also because, after the presuntuosa and sangrienta façade, hides a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is diálogos or not a action logic, everything is atmosphere, a dream febril transformed in film.
And that is why there is no escapatoria for viewers.
Refn condede barely a time of relaxation and their images glaciares and the lúgubre banda sonora of trance i make a nudo in their throats, above all, the incredible hatred, that since the corazones characters goes towards it.
Only a small young rubio, which supports unojo fielmente, conserva something as inocencia, all the other are poseídos by the ira.
Above all, the héroe one eye, whose reasons are not explain never, at any time becomes a guerrero out of the infierno for enemies and allies provisionales, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
The represents the perdición, but perhaps only for those who are perdidos anyway.
"Walhalla rising" is a film misteriosa which can be odiar and admire, for enfadarse, alterarse and sorprenderse.
A experience.
Misteriosos movements of land
The organisation of energy nuclear oiea has new indicios of a programme nuclear secrecy in syria.
The country rejected opinar on this issue until permitan controls.
On the average night of 5 to 6 september 2007, at least four aircraft israelíes fight f - 15 i atacaron a mysterious edificio cúbico in syria.
Is in the orilla of éufrates; the city more and more close, 30 kilometres is dair as - saur.
Its name appears in documents of the international energy agency atómica (oiea) is on a reactor that, apparently the syrians construyeron with the help of north corea in the cubo, hidden in a valle that comes out of río.
According to information of the international intelligence service in the united states. cia the end of april 2008, design a reactor aware under the name of the proximidades - the - kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonio, with the construyen nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technical hardly serves for other purposes than for those of the 1950s.
With the cia showed a presentation in video images of satellite borrosas.
Showed with a animación by computer where were the components of the reactor before the destrucción, which was a copia reducida of norcoreano model of the central nuclear yongbyon.
In addition taught photographs that showed the edificio since the proximidades or from the internal.
The reactor had little time was in operation, says, but not yet was equipado with fuel rods.
Today, three years later the bombardeo, is hardly more known by the then, the enigmas were greatest with time.
The previous president of the usa, george w. bush desveló recently in his memoirs that before the attack cia was completely sure that the syrians had built a reactor in the - kibar, but that just was indicios that in the country existiera "a programme of nuclear weapons."
In europe, several of the secret service agents prefieren be still more prudent and only speak of a "course reactor," although consider "plausible" the presentation of the cia.
Evidence sólidas missing, as well as to the oiea them.
When i preguntó sure that was to have a reactor, a high diplomático ahead of the nu responded in the summer of lapidaria way that the oiea needs "enough material to be questions."
The syrian deshicieron with great speed of the escombros presunto "edificio military inutilizado" and allanaron the ground to conscience.
However, in june 2008 a team of the oiea under the mando of previous inspector head olli heinonen found rastos of uranio in the - kibar, which had been fabricado by people.
In addition the oiea obtained by satellite images on a member state, sellers fair trade at the moment after the attack, which must have a value greater information of which presented the cia.
However, these photographs not arrived on the market because a customer unknown, perhaps israel, the bought exclusively.
That is why the oiea cannot verify its autenticidad regardless.
Syria always gave to understand that never had had a programme nuclear secret or built any reactor.
The uranio procedía the weapons israelíes, explained damaskus.
The oiea rejected as inverosímil after the analysis of the partículas.
Since then damaskus refuses to discuss the matter, of the same way that with regard to the images by satellite.
In addition, the controladores are prohibits a second inspection in the - kibar and entry to the ruinas of the edificio bombardeado.
Israel is also an estricto silence.
"Never comentaremos," ehud olmert, prime minister in office at the time of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Well, the research in the case has not given results from june 2008 and "transformed progresivamente in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a diplomático western high office up with a place in the oiea in vienna finally is pending a serious infringement against the treaty of proliferación of weapons atómicas, not by the vela of oiea.
The oiea considers three teams more as the key to the progress in the esclarecimiento, which must be "functional" in connection with the presunto reactor, and others such as these still exist.
The inspectores have not given publicly known until the time of what equipment tratan, or what functions have, or if seem to sospechosos.
According to the newspaper süddeutschen zeitung, the internal oiea has designado as to marj as - sultan, masyaf and iskandariayah again derivado of the proximidades of towns situadas.
The independent institute for science and international security in washington (isis) identificó these places and localizó a complex of buildings around masyaf with the images by satellite, which very probably be one of the objetos sospechosos.
Possibly under or immediately the hand of a military base, syria prohibits this reason the entrance to the three places the oiea.
In vienna it says that the syrians fear a register that the usa have solicitado to the oiea for espiar plantas militares.
The detectives were alerta on the nuclear equipment thanks to the advertencias secret service of the united states.
Through photographs by satellite, the oiea is indicios that traslada material between the three places and the cubo to the orilla of éufrates.
A western diplomático with a high office in vienna stated that at least one of the equipment can be "relacionado with the production of fuel."
But there is no indicio "activities sensibles," of enriquecimiento of uranio or of reacondicionamiento; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The kind of reactor acciona with uranio that is not enriquecido.
Of where the uranio must come and where the plutonio must separated subsequently for the central bombas, for these questions there are, in the best of cases, suposiciones plausibles.
There are doubts about whether the ruinas, not the valiosas pistas that can recuperarse, are in the three places.
As desaparecieron the burden of the camiones hundreds of suelo, nobody has information on where remain the escombros.
The oiae considers it unlikely the mina of salt - tibni, located in the few kilometres from the éufrates - kibar to the other hand, that the syrian recognised in 1998 by its aptitud as area for residuos radioactivos.
Recently, robert kelly, the previous inspector of oiea, the relacionó with the reactor in an analysis of the satellite images for the prestigiosa magazine jane "s intelligence review.
But the photographs from the órbita show that the syrian efectuaron movements of land in the three supuestos places sospechosos and eliminaron large contenedores after the oiea solicitara entry.
Can be accident but hardly contribuye to disipar the suspicion.
In addition to that, in the sector diplomático says that the oiea has used some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the syrian permitieran, to maintain the possible secret military, only the despliegue shows the scale of the interest of the inspectores.
Entretanto, damaskus critica also this proposal.
The western diplomáticos a year ago in vienna was reassured that the reactor was destroyed, that is why the issue has no great urgency, from a couple of months ago, glyn davies, a kind of ambassador of the united states. esgrime the so - called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigurosos means that the vienesas nuclear authorities have to establish the controls.
Yukiya amano, the director of the oiea, which must propose these inspections, spoke of "one option open to which i am in the future," but still vacila.
This way is very risky: for this is needed most of the council of gobernación the oiea, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not precisely ansiosos by an escalation.
Furthermore, as reflexionó a diplomático: "and what happens if at the end are nothing?"
The love in times of war
There are problems since angelina jolie started in summer with the direction of its debut still without behalf.
This same has written script, a history of love between a bosnia and a serbio.
We do not know much more to the matter, but this is sufficient for the agitación.
The rumor is very persistente, women, musulmana, enamora of its violador serbio during the war of yugoslavia.
The women bosnias associations have protestado quickly, with which in the last moment trasladaron some days of running planeados in sarajevo to hungary.
The film has been rodado in hungary and the posproducción, but there are protests in bosnia yet.
Bakira female hasecic of the organisation of victims of war wrote to the un high comisaria, acnur, for jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a bosnio, jolie is the embajadora newspaper of the un high comisaria for the refugiados.
It is not diplomática, weeks women we offered a meeting in hungary which rejected.
The meeting took place in bosnia, says hasecic.
Does not give stories of love in the fields of violations, and the position of jolie to regard delata to the victims enough on the script.
Their organisation agreement with the high comisaria of the un for the refugiados has recomendado destituir reports to jolie as embajadora, the guardian.
But what exactly jolie has written to the scenes?
The ministry of culture bosnio that leyó indent, otorgó after a tira and afloja a recording in sarajevo licence, is not all clear why jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reitera not pursues propósitos politicians with his film, was introduce with much effort in the conflicto yugoslavo, wants to show the horribles consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parties implicadas.
Its content remains impreciso.
In the circula a second sinopsis network of the film that sounds quite distinta: the loving were together before the start of the war and again found when it, a bosnia musulmana, is deportada to a field serbio in which he works as guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "victim of violación enamora torturador."
It is certain that the film of jolie comienza really before the war.
The pressure on it, jolie says, is "unfair and based on information errónea."
Currently can lograr peace with the hackers hollywood: while the script continues in the way ilegal network, as many other earlier.

The rutina democratic
Continues to increase the support for democracy in latinoamérica, as well as the respaldo to private companies.
The delincuencia creates greater concern that the unemployment.
In addition, in large part of the region, it is brazil as a country more influential than the united states.
These are some of the conclusions of the last latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively by the economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly from 1995, allows carry out a follow - up of the changes of attitude in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, carried out in september and the beginning of october, destacan two issues relacionadas.
The first is the humour relatively animado reinante in latinoamérica.
The second is the growing stability of the main actitudes towards democracy and its institutions.
The support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries of the pacific coast sudamérica (consulte the table 1).
For example, in perú, where the annual economic growth has reached an average of 6% since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40% in 2005 61% this year.
Creció also in mexico, where the economy has been recuperado after suffer a great decline of the production of last year.
However, as only half of the respondents of mexico and brazil, the two countries more poblados of the area, are convinced democrats, which low average regional (consulte the gráfico 2).
Around the 44% of those polled in the region are declared satisfechos with the way in which democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure that last year, but considerably higher at 25% recorded in 2001 (gráfico 3).
Around the 34% said that confiaban in the congress of their country and the 45% in government, the same amount that the last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulence in latinoamérica afectaron gravemente support to democracy.
The fact that it has mantenido during the global financial crisis is probably deba to many countries latinoamericanos so only were affected by a brief recession and disfrutaron of a strong recuperación.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has contribuido to protect the most pobres.
(The united nations economic commission for america latina reported this week that the proportion of latinoamericanos living in conditions of poverty as only increase marginalmente in 2009 and that has been reduced again this year, until the 32%).
However, the state of mind varía considerably from one country to another consulte the gráfico (4).
The good rendimientos economic brazil and the popularity of its president saliente, luiz inácio lula da silva, reflects in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in mexico and centroamérica, where the recession was more serious and have increased the crimes violentos.
For the second time since that began the surveys, more respondents in latinoamérica mencionan the delincuencia, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem that is enfrenta their country (consulte the gráfico 5).
Around the 31% says that, is them or a pariente near, has been victim of the delincuencia in the last year, a figure that has been reduced from 38% last year and that is the lesser porcentaje recorded since 1995.
The rendimientos economic more positive reflejan in greater support to private companies and to the market economy: around the 71% of those polled in the region afirman that private companies are indispensables for the development, while in 2007 only was the gráfico 6 56% (consulte).
Around the 58% concuerda in that the market economy is the only system that permitirá which their country is desarrolle, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that the 62% of respondents in venezuela opinan same (and 80% respalda to private companies), although its president izquierdista, hugo chávez, is expropiando many private companies.
Brazil is the country that ejerce greater leadership in the region, as indicates the 19% of respondents (against the 18% last year), followed by the united states (9%, same figure that last year) and venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the united states is the country more influential considered by the respondents in mexico and great part of centroamérica, while venezuela ostenta this title in ecuador, the republic dominicana and nicaragua.
Elections to the rubbish
No one expected that the general elections celebradas on 28 november in haití fuesen perfect.
However, transcurrieron of a much worse than we feared the foreigners who try to help the country to remontar after its problems.
It introdujeron votes in the urnas, some people votó several times, papeletas tiradas in the electoral alcantarillas, colegios destruidos and acts of intimidación.
The electoral colegios opened with hours of delay.
Many haitianos, inclusive groups desplazados by the earthquake of january, vagaban for the area trying to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, at the end, it gave for vencidos.
A dozen of the presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denunciaron fraud and asked the cancellation of the elections.
The violent protests, some of them, be extendieron by all the country.
However, edmond mulet united nations, the official of greater rango in haití, declared that were "elections" relatively good in many ways.
The observers of the organisation of american states and the community of the caribe said, with cautela, that "no opinamos these irregularities, for serious, invaliden necessarily the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The election autoridad, that according to their contrincantes is committed to rené préval, the president saliente unpopular, and with its candidate, jude célestin, should anunciar the results preliminares 7 december.
Be that the desempate will take place in january.
Is not yet have lost all the esperanzas in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, michel martelly, a rapero, and mirlande manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which solicitaban the invalidación of the vote.
But still problems can arise if the election autoridad declared that mr célestin, that hardly has support, if it has any, has happened to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemia of cólera arrasa the country and more than a million of the survivors of the earthquake is still living in tents, expects a great abstención.
At the moment, many haitianos querían vote, but not managed to do so due to a lack of organisation.
Around 250.000 documents of identidad, necessary to vote, still had not been distribuido little before the elections.
There is much at stake.
The donantes aid consider that the choice of a government of the people, and legítimo is an essential step in the reconstruction of haití.
And, as has quedado patente, also think the own haitianos.
Avanzando of puntillas towards the centre
In the weeks that have passed since lost its esposo, cristina fernández, the president of argentina, has disfrutado of a large simpatía between the public that has increased its rate of popularity in 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level which has recorded since his election in 2007.
In spite of all, that can make a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of next year dependerá if the clearly afectada madam fernández leaves hand the intransigencia of their difunto husband, predecesor and political partner, néstor kirchner.
And, at this point, the indicaciones are not concluyentes.
Mr kirchner, which seguía haciéndose office of the economic policy even after his wife would sucediese as president, i had the costumbre produce presupuestos that infravaloraban the income fiscales, economic growth and inflation.
This permitió the marriage presidential spend income adicionales its discreción.
In theory, the government of the fernández lost its majority in congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has empeorado following the death of kirchner because of an attack cardíaco on 27 october.
Some differing member states of the peronista movement in power have been enfrentado madam fernández.
However, after caóticas sesiones in which a member gave a puñetazo to another in the face and other members acusaron the government of soborno, congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," the president said.
The 2010 budget, in consequence, apply to the next year, the president that provide a margin of still greater action at the time of gastarlo.
The economy is improving considerably: probably crezca until a 9% this year.
The rate of inflation is currently in the official 11,1%, but many private calculations, in addition to wage demands of the sindicatos, the sitúan approximately 30%.
Mr kirchner, which took power in 2003 when argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, was that the growth and the reduction of poverty fuesen their prioridades, instead of the control of inflation.
It refused to negotiate with the fmi, presionó to the private sector and that the indec, the institute of statistics, adaptase official statistics of inflation.
Do moderará now the president fernández these policies?
Has convocado meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the sindicatos.
Moreover, their officials afirman who want to limit the wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been seen impulsada by the elevados prices of the exportaciones agrícolas argentinas in the world.
However, the inflation has limited the impetus to the growth achieved with a large devaluación in 2002.
Perhaps that is why the madam fernández is dando signs of wanting to restore the financial vínculos of argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government came to an agreement with the titulares bonds that had been refused to a restructuring forzosa previa of the debt that argentina had not abonado in 2001.
At present, it seems that the madam fernández is about to hold an agreement with the governments creditors agrupados in the paris club, which must around usd 6.700 million.
The kirchner always insisted that this does not implicaría the supervisión of fmi, as often be normal.
However, last month amado boudou, the economy, minister announced that the fund provide "technical" assistance to draw up a new rate of prices to the national consumption, which seems to the preludio to the limpieza of the indec.
It is clear if the president fernández wants to continue in the policy when end its mandate, bearing in mind that no longer has to your husband to hand.
If, need ganarse the support of the middle class, much of which has been cansado of kirchnerismo.
When the argentinos regresen of their holidays estivales in march, the ola simpatía by it will be decaído.
If it wants to win other elections, will have to decide whether or not, with repudia calmly, many of the policies of her husband.
The hurra by china
The voters of taiwán are acercando lentamente to a kind of union more close with the continent.
What view taiwán on its big brother to the other side of the close?
More than eur 7.5 million voters, 70% of the elegibles, acudieron the 27 november to choose the alcaldes and concejales of five distritos urban in what appears to be a comprehensive assessment of the president, ma ying - jeou.
Mr ma himself has returned a defender of the feelings of the continent, forjando innovadores vínculos empresariales, including a free trade pact part, the greatest changes in relations with china since 1949.
Mr ma happened proof, but by little.
Although his party kuomintang (kmt) ended gaining three of the five elections to alcaldía, not managed to obtain the majority of votes.
In its place, the progresista democratic party (ppd), which has been inclinado by a total of taiwán independence, was almost 50% of all the votes against the 45% of the kmt.
If had been the presidential, mr ma be in problems.
Since its choice two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has disminuido in around 8%.
For the first time, the ppd empató with the kmt in municipalities.
In the elections will be able to see the típicos elements of the elections taiwanesas, including ruidosos camiones of campaign and large aglomeraciones with banderitas and girls light of bailando clothing.
Nor faltó the mysterious attempt to murder of rigor.
Are lien, the son of lien chan, president honorario of the kmt, was doing campaign by one of the candidates of the kmt the evening before the elections.
A man of the multitude disparó young directly to the view, hiriéndole and matando to a transeúnte.
The curioso is that has not been able to determine if the man intended to damage lien or vengarse of the candidate.
In any case, says tsai ing - wen, the leader of the ppd, the shooting affected at the elections, sembrando sospechas on the ppd and provocando that the voters inclinasen by the kmt.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was china.
Resultó surprising that they were not the subject of the continent itself.
In their place, the candidates hablaron plans of alojamiento public and creation of employment.
Taiwán normally disfruta of their independence facto and military detesta the threat of china.
Therefore, the kmt usually avoid giving their vínculos with the government in pekín advertising.
But this time also the ppd avoided alentar feeling against china.
Responds to the new awareness that the chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of taiwán.
For its part, mr ma stated that had been confirmed that its policy with regard to china was acceptable to the majority of the taiwaneses.
It provides that the government of pekín siga sobornándoles with trade, in accordance with its strategy for lograr that taiwán vuelva the redil.
China lost no time enviando a negociador taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of investments and the cooperation médica.
Without doubt, i would like to achieve the integration policy, but also the first is the first.
The best will be expected to pass the presidential elections in 2012 for this.
In any case, the ppd has been reinventado.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: its former leader, chen shui - bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigaba openly the independence explícita.
However, under the leadership of mrs tsai, a new generation of moderados has arisen and the ppd is esforzando by attracting professionals and young people.
The madam tsai has been acogida gratamente as candidate of the ppd for the presidency, as its tseng - chang, that mandate under chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that can also have relations with pekín.
The madam tsai announced the creation of a group of experts that actúe plans as point of contact between the ppd and china, provided that they can llevarse out negotiations without conditions previas.
The public taiwanés madam tsai says that his party represents a "alternative fiable" the precipitado approach of mr ma with regard to china.
Mr chen seems furioso for change.
In a declaración emitida since its celda, stated that the candidates of the ppd had gone better parados if had insistido that taiwán is an independent country.
Even ordenó the mr his presidential the, a pragmático, which not presentase.
Even without interceda mr chen, the ppd will have difficulties for escoger between their possible candidates.
The kmt also must make an examination of conscience.
The valoraciones of mr ma have been pobres, despite the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the kmt have not wanted to do with him campaign.
Its lack of popularity seems to deberse mainly to unemployment and the differences crecientes between ricos and pobres.
A spokesperson for the kmt says that reestructurará his cabinet, as well as local equipment.
The large muestras ppd sugieren that the support of taiwán to a acercamiento is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the taiwaneses consider that the economic integration with china is inevitable.
According to antonio chiang, a well - known columnista, "has already been cruzado the point of not retorno."
Nominations to the grammy: the singer jazz hope spalding is the choice surprise in the category of artist disclosure.

Its ambicioso album of 2010, "chamber music society," without doubt supuso a breakthrough, and bearing in mind its voice style light and pleasant, as well as a great skill with influencias pop, funk and ritmos latins, can be at least to establish a distinción between spalding and the way towards the success of norah jones in 2003, the equivalente more near to the voters of the grammys, that últimamente have been concentrado in the area of jazz for this category.

The salvaje punk of darcy james argue "s secret society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, compitiendo against the great jazz of house of the billy childs ensemble and always risky dave holland, whose album in live with their octeto," pathways ," was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bajista in its banda.

A microbio resistente the arsénico plantea the possibility of new forms of life on earth or in other places...
The descubrimiento of a extraña bacteria that can use the arsénico as one of its nutrientes amplía the possibility of finding new ways of life on earth and, possibly, in other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curiosa bacteria here on earth, say that demuestra that it is possible that has ways of life without the main elements that consideraban essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"Crecer may be with fósforo or arsénico."
"That the becomes something very peculiar, although little lack you to be a kind of way of life really" alienígena ," commented paul c. w. davies the arizona state university, coautor of the report that appears in the edition line of the thursday of the publication science.
For a long time, we consider that there are six major elements essential to life: the carbon, hidrógeno, the nitrógeno, the oxígeno, the fósforo and the azufre.
However, the researchers have discovered that the bacteria, hallada in monkey lake, california, can continue creciendo after replace the fósforo by the arsénico.
"You plantearte what more is possible," said ariel d. anbar of the arizona state university, coautor of the report.
According to indicated anbar, the discovery is important for the search for life in planets different from the land, given that the researchers need to recognise, know the aspect of life.
The study focuses on a microbio discovered in the land.
However, the convocatoria a rueda of press for debatirlo, which is not divulgaron details of the descubrimiento, generó a great speculation on the internet on the possibility that the report indicase descubrimiento of life extraterrestre.
It did not.
What the descubrimiento "yes shows is that in other entornos planetarios, could be organismos that use other elements for impulsar its bioquímica and that the whole of elements" standard "that we consider indispensable for life perhaps not so fijo," commented charles cockell, catedrático of planetary and space sciences research institute, open university, in milton keynes, united kingdom.
Cockell not formó part of the team of research.
"This work is novedoso because demuestra the replacement of a on the other element in the bioquímica and the basic structure bioquímica," added cockell.
The descubrimiento is not realizó by accident.
Felisa wolfe - simon of institute astrobiología of the nasa, which dirigió the study, centró in the monkey lake because presents elevados levels of arsénico.
The arsénico and fósforo are similares from the point of view químico, so that especuló that a microbio expuesto both could replace one on the other.
"The arsénico is tóxico primarily because its químico is similar the behaviour of the fósforo."
"In consequence, can resultarle complicated the organismos diferenciarlos."
The arsénico is enough, however, different as not to work as well as the fósforo by, for what falls and, decirlo in some way, apelmaza the maquinaria bioquímica ," explains anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterias known as gfaj - 1 and expusieron to concentraciones ever greater of arsénico, to which adaptarse achieved, and used for crecer.
The microbio growing better with fósforo, but the fact that show that can live with arsénico in their place plantea the possibility of that there can be a natural way of life that used arsénico, whether in other areas of land or in another planet or luna where the arsénico is more common.
Jamie s. foster, professor auxiliar microbiología in the university of florida, indicated that the idea that it can replace the arsénico by the fósforo is not new, but never had found an example that demostrase that works.
The common arsénico was more in the first eras of the land, pointed out, so that the researchers especularon the first forms of life can haberlo usado.
"Yes which suggests that could be other means of generar life, not only the way in which life is formaba in the land formerly," indicated foster, that not formaba part of the team of research wolfe - simon.
The research contó with the support of the nasa, the department of energy and the national institutes of health.

The tentativas of moelis and cooper resolve the financial tribulaciones of mgm and meet the more than 140 creditors the study, requirieron much more time of esperado.
After several months of discusiones, to the end of 2009 the parties acordaron put to the sale.
However, the auctioning atrajo just a few postores and none prepared to pay more than usd 2 billion that creditors seeking.
Before the spring of this year, the bureau again design while the team of mgm began to work in a restructuring plan which, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors in the end of october.

To edge combinado with dance, dance star mickey (fisher - price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking paid the technology of elmo live last year, the muñeco animatrónico 14 pulgadas plays games change of time as simóm says, and can make the step lunar, thanks to their innovadores feet articulados with wheelchair device of blockade.
The children who probaron the juguete usaron mickey as a instructor of dance, although their parents quejaron by the lack of a control of volume.

More promueve the one hand moderado the maintenance of the order in china
As a sargento instructor urban, tang shenbin marked the step in a place of the city, inspeccionando with severidad to the nerviosas people to your office, emitiendo orders in voice low with autoridad military.
He wanted to which the member states femeninos of urban chengguan, the corpulentos policemen of the order of china, temidos and despreciados by their measures enérgicas caprichosas and its inclinación to violence, comunicaran a certain impression a puñado of spectators.
"Firmes!"
"Attention!"
I muéstrenles, susurró, "how are the muchachas bonitas!"
Four muchachas that barely had the adolescence with white guantes and chaquetas verde oliva idénticas and trousers adjusted to draw the attention.
Four pares shoes black perfectly alineados.
Four sombreros elegantes colocados perfectly top of the cabello tied up with moños to rayas blue and women.
"Personalmente, i think that have a apariencia normal," said mr tang, desdeñosamente.
"Models are lindos."
More of a government has treaty limpiar the image of the urban inspectores of china.
A city ordenó that all the new reclutas have a title of degree.
The province of guangdong cambió the colour verde grisáceo blue of the uniformes a supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan central, in china, sustituyó the use of force by miradas intimidatorias: in 2009, according to a report, 50 rodearon official a díscolo carrito of snacks, and noted with the ceño fruncido constantly for half an hour, until the vendedor travelling recogió their things and marchó.
Xindu urban, a district of 680.000 inhabitants in chengdu, has elegido a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to their police urbana 13 women, expressly elected by their apariencia, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give to the tosca police a more suave, female side.
Lamentablemente, until scarlett johansson should fight to increase the ínfimo respect of china for with these escuadrones the city.
And by a good reason, argumentarían critics.
Unlike the police, these are autorizados only to meet ordenanzas official of the city, imponiendo multas and other administrative penalties.
But the means of news chinese retratan rutinariamente a different reality.
In january 2008, the inspectores the province of hubei killed through blows a transeúnte after having usado its celular to filmarlos while disolvían a protest against a vertedero of waste.
Last year, a manual of training for inspectores of pekín was hurtado and published on the internet, in which is described as azotar with eficacia criminals without hacerlos sangrar.
This year, a vendedor travelling sandías of shanghai suffered brain damage after a riña with five official.
A video game full of violence, available to unload in line, presents inspectores entrenados by the chinese that atacan sellers callejeros.
"Chengguan has left a cicatriz regretted china daily, in the government," a national publication, last year after another controversia on tactic.
The daily called "a limpieza really meticulosa."
The sceptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district solicitara through a warning eight new reclutas femeninas in october, a editorial in the beijing evening news preguntó if women were deberes real or were simply a distracción escénica.
The answer seems to be a bit of both things.
The warning of the district called candidates femeninas 18 to 22 years, with a good is "and the five faciales features armoniosos."
Should have a altura above the average, than 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ pulgadas.
The retiro at the age of 26 years is obligatorio.
The officials said that the work was físicamente too arduo for women with more than 25 years.
"Its image is the important" district, i said a anónimo official to rednet. com, a web site quasi - government.
"First, the cualidades externas of the candidates determinarán if cumplen with the requisitos, as altura, weight, faciales features, etc."
Then comes the temperamento "and the internal cualidades."
The chengguan femeninos are as floreros, said, and added, "in addition to be floreros, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng lihua, subdirector of the office of the city of district administration, is not ansioso by respaldar this description.
But noted that the demands of working altura were estándares in many avisos chinese for both sexos.
Then comes the requirement of faciales features armoniosos.
If this means be apuesto, is a matter of debate between the chinese.
Certainly, the minusválido or desfigurado must not stand.
"We cannot allow that a person coja or a jorobado vengan to work here," said mr zheng.
"Its image not be well."
Liu yi patrol, who baoguang close to a monasterio square, has 22 years, with its mejillas coloradas and a boca sutilmente curva.
It does not believe that the acento in its aspect is sexista, said.
"Do you believe that parezco sexy with this uniform?" preguntó a look sardónica.
His colleague of work with hoyuelos, xu yang, of 21 years ago, said "our work to present the image of the city."
Nor is oponen them to their working time determinado, said, because abrigan career ambitions greater than simply ahuyentar sellers in the callejones where it means that circunscriben its business.
Every morning, the escuadrón enfrenta more or less to a dozen sellers ambulantes lanzan ordinary or in bicicleta, tratando sell many panecillos or tazones of tofú as possible before being echados.
"Mr wang, is that marcharse."
"I have said many times!" señorita said xu as a vendedor escapaba ordinary, abandonando temporalmente its cart tirado by bicicleta with guarniciones of fideos.
The official describen their deberes as more monótonos that agotadores.
"This is more or less the same every day," said huang jing, 20 years, who study marketing in their free time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that the official femeninos carecen of the power of its homólogos masculinos confiscar the mercadería of sellers.
Can amenazar with denunciar only to the infractores their supervisores men.
This tends to protegerlas of the repentinas demostraciones public of animosidad against the burocracia, which are common in all parts of china.
This year, hundreds of citizens in kunming, the provincial capital of yunnan, amotinaron then that is esparciera the false rumor that official chengguan had murdered a vendedor.
More than a dozen police or official chengguan resultaron heridos night in the episode; 14 of the government were volcados vehicles or prendidos fuego.
At the moment xindu has evitado such violence.
But the calm barely is guaranteed.
Only two streets of the apacible square baoguang, where the official femeninos patrullaron this morning, more than 50 people met in a esquina.
The official had confiscado a motocicleta that was being reparada in the acera instead of a taller, as the regulation requires.
The owner of the motorcycle gritaba groseramente.
The situation is estancó for 15 minutes before the official, with bad side, abrieran step to the codazos until their vehicles and are fueran quickly with the motocicleta and its owner.
Li xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator allotted to escuadrón masculino, remained behind, with your insignia white given back to hide their name.
As the official femeninos, the coordinadores, men of 40 years or more, play a role purely of support.
Unlike them, not teach them to maintain a elegante image.
"Sometimes luchamos verbalmente."
"Sometimes luchamos físicamente," mr li with total naturalidad said.
"The greater part of the time is the public that the fight" begins.
The fiscales not levantarán charges against the senator ensign
The lawyers senator announced on wednesday that the fiscales the department of justice have exculpado senator john ensign of the imputaciones criminals that surgieron of his affair with a former assistant of campaign and their efforts to ensure through lobby work to the husband of women.
The legal decision ends with the threat more serious than enfrenta ensign, the republican of nevada that was regarded as possible republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on their national affair took titulares last year and dañara his career.
The office of ensign said that sintió "surely contento" by the decision, which was then a research to a whole year.
Senator still could face a measure disciplinaria of the senate committee of ética.
Lawyers ensign said that the department of justice had "informed us that the senator ensign is no longer an objective of its research and that there is no plan to levantar charges against him for this issue."
The department of justice not quiso make comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many lawyers of ética outside the department of justice, who said that seemed to have significativas evidence to indicate that ensign could have confabulado for violar a ban on lobby federal criminal.
The interviews, the correo electronic and other documents that divulgaron in first place in october 2009 in the new york times showed that ensign had helped to douglas hampton, who was one of its ayudantes, to obtain work lucrativo through lobby, for lograr the silence of hampton and his wife, cynthia, on the affair of senator with it.
The madam hampton once worked as tesorera a campaign in ensign.
Ensign was in contact with several patrocinadores politicians to encontrarle work to mr hampton and called on behalf of them after that had contratado to mr hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As hampton had been recently an assistant of ensign, was excluded according to the law of do lobby to their former empleador or the senate for a year.
The experts in ética said that the inusual between ensign and hampton, who were friends íntimos before the affair appeared in desacuerdo with the so - called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks restringir that former state employees use their personal connections to do business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "seemed to be a case facie of a conspiración premium for violar substantially the estatuto revolving door," said stanley brand, a lawyer in washington that especializa in defender customers investigados by the government.
While the officials of the department of justice rehusaron explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case ensign, mr brand and other lawyers of ética said that the time of the department seemed cautious to accept procesamientos political after several reveses important for their section of public integridad, including the last year "s decision to abandon the processing against the former senator ted stevens, in the midst of charges for bad conduct of procedure.
The federal fiscales "are clearly cobardes," said melanie sloan, executive director of the citizens to the responsibility and ética in washington, a group of defence that brought several complaints against ensign in the case.
"This básicamente means that the officials of the government of high rango now can assume that the laws are not aplican," added to them.
Paul coggins, the main advocate of ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a public prosecutor of the department of justice on monday and other so - called more at the next day, diciéndole the department not wanted to levantar charges against their customers.
The defence of ensign team had been cooperando with the fiscales in the attempt to persuadirlos that senator, as his office reiteró in a declaración on wednesday, "actuó agree with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments that i gave to the fiscales.
"I do not feel comfortable entrando in details on my discusiones with the department of justice, i can only say that pensamos that tomaron decision justa," said.
Last month, the commission "s federal elections decided to change a research in a queja separada by the group of ética, that alega a payment of 96.000 dollars of the parents of ensign hampton election violó the federal law.
The electoral commission said that was not sufficient evidence to show that the money was not more than a gift.
Nv energy is an important company of nevada which was supported for a long time to senator, which managed to work through lobby thanks to the aid that ensign gave hampton.
An electronic correo sent in december 2008 showed that after the company accepted to hampton as lobbista, the head of cabinet of ensign, john lopez, informed with hampton and i said that was "machacando" the ministry of internal on an issue in disputa.
Ensign also attended a lunch with hampton and other client of nevada, allegiant air, and called the secretary of transport to establish a meeting on behalf of the air line after that had contratado hampton to lobby.
When for the first aparecieron the news of the affair last year, ensign i asked perdón to their constituents and abandoned its position as republican fourth leader in the senate.
After maintain a low profile for many months, two weeks ago ensign i told reporters that planeó postularse to a third mandate in the senate.
When the vocero of ensign, jennifer cooper, announced that ensign already was not the subject of a criminal investigation, said that the senator expected that the committee on ética follow the example of the department of justice and concluyera rapidly its research.
"The senator ensign has deseos continue with its difficult work on behalf of the people of nevada," said.
The appeal of cheshire apuntará to twitter
Had half a dozen of them "chateando" in the filas the chamber of the court.
Minute to minute, enviaron reports of the espantoso testimony way twitter.
At the end, the defence says, there were more 140.000 messages of twitter on the process that abordó the violación and children atados its camas in a house which was prendida fuego.
On thursday, the process broadly followed steven j. hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of cheshire, connecticut, is ready to reach a final official, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty adopted by the jury.
But of mr hayes have tabled escritos lawyers, in the court that delinean the arguments of the appeals that probably ocuparán to the courts for years.
One of the most provocativos says that the intensos reports on the process, including the broad use of twitter by journalists means of information masiva, created "an atmosphere of circus," and such saturación generalizada and inmediata with details exaltadores made that public pasiones ejercieran a inapropiada influence on the jury.
The reclamo could force to the judges of appeal to lidiar with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the chamber of the court.
"According to what experimenté during this process, i think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the chamber of the court is afectando the rights of the individual to have a fair process," said thomas j. ullmann, main advocate of the defence of mr hayes.
The judge of first instance jon c. blue, state of the supreme court rejected lacónicamente the demandas in a fallo last week, saying that the means of news were "carefully controlados" and that there was no proof that the jury has been led by the passion.
But probably will not be the last word on the subject.
During décadas, the court of appeal have recognised that the coverage of cases celebres can generar questions on the imparcialidad of a process.
In a historic fallo of 1966, the court suprema united states revocó the condemnation of a osteópata of cleveland, doctor sam sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case sheppard vs. maxwell, which had "an atmosphere of carnaval in the process" due to the media.
It believes that the crime was inspired by the television and film "the fugitivo" programme.
Some lawyers said that the court of appeals examinaron the condemnation of mr hayes half a century later, could feel intrigados necessary for the argument that could be new rules to control the form of communication from the rooms of the court, something inimaginadable in the time of the case of doctor sheppard.
"There is a reason general concern on the impact of the new media" in processes of high profile, john j. donohue said iii, a professor of the school of laws stanford, that studied the penalty of death in connecticut and wrote a report in the said that this was impuesta arbitrarily.
The professor donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigados for the idea that limit the communication inmediata since the rooms of the court could do that the juicios fueran more justos.
The issue of twitter is only one of many of the issues delineados by lawyers hayes, which probably will be discutidos during years, retrasando a execution.
The defence lawyers also afirman, for example, that hayes could have been perjudicado when the judge blue rehusó permitirles that testearan the reactions of the jurados potential, mostrándoles photographs espeluznantes the scene of crime during the selection of the jury.
Some jurados have said that were horrorizados by the photographs of the victims, jennifer hawke - petit, 48 years, and their daughters, hayley, 17 and michaela 11.
The defence lawyers say that also cuestionarán constitucionalidad the penalty of death and sostendrán that the judge incorrectamente removió to a jury that had criticised the fiscales, and that incorrectamente had presionado for a verdict by its extraña decision of ordenarle the jury deliberar during a weekend.
The jurados not were kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract the greater part of the interest.
They observed in a recusación the verdict archivado last month that the case dominó the news in connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for gobernador and the united states senate.
They argued that the media constantly echaban leña the fuego the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeración of tweets of the media, the cameras and the court" s reporteros outside, wrote lawyers, "was something never seen here in the new haven and perhaps in the whole state."
Your attention in the coverage of tweeter is controvertida.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the queja on the fact that the news inmediatas were more important that the reports handed over lentamente, were a vision ludita which would be that the policy of the court on the control of the coverage outside weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the court of appeal often felt atraídos by the arguments on the adaptación requería in the courts due to the social changes and tecnológicos.
The lawyers of hayes are presionando by this reclamo.
In writing, refirieron to the decision of 1966 the suprema court, which revoca the condemnation of the doctor sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that exigirían that the new means requerirían new rules.
"This case," wrote, "is the case sheppard vs. maxwell of the 21st century."
How can the civismo tender a puente for unir the divisiones?
After a remarkable campaign by the invectiva and the negatividad, has been desencadenado a little civismo this week in washington.
Is it a harbinger of a genuina cooperation bipartidista future or a time ilusorio before a rapid return to the fight partidista in the capital?
Tuesday "s meeting between president obama and the leaders of the congress does not place any progress in the major issues that must be the treaties during the sitting saliente.
But so that all say, was at least a discussion cortés on the differences between the two parties, as well as a shared recognition of their responsibilities to govern, it is time to be another episode vacío in order to win points partidistas.
The meeting of wednesday the commission of public deficit of the president was equally civilizada, despite the differences that subsisten policies between the member states.
It seems clear that the interaction close during a period of months generó a respect mutuo that we trasciende the gap ideológica still separa to the member states.
That is scarcely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of test, sondeándose mutuamente to identify signs of cooperativismo and commitment, while tratan assess the limits of the public and the paciencia of the voters for a renovada partidista war.
Reason for which the tuesday and meeting the posteriores evaluaciones of the same on the part of the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The differences filosóficas between obama and the republicans are too large and are very deeply arraigadas as to sugerir any rapid climate change that existió during the last two years.
It is that we are talking about taxes, social expenditure, assistance sanitaria or support, the two parties are in polos opuestos.
Anyway, the choice of november has suavizado humour in washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way of say things," said pete wehner, an official of the bush administration now in the centre of ética and public policy.
"Are inevitable after the elections.
The elections are pasiones partidarias, which then extinguen.
That is good ."
In some issues, in particular those that figuran in the agenda of the sitting saliente, the republican and democrat have no other option to find a solution.
The bush reducciones taxes vencen at the end of year, and nobody is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way of preservar some or all the reducciones, so permanent or temporary.
The same way, it is likely that there is a commitment to ampliar subsidios of unemployment, probably because the republicans can do not believe that they are in favour of the reducciones taxes for the ricos, denying the subsidio unemployment for the workers desempleados.
After the meeting of the tuesday in the white house, there are more optimismo by a possible trato on these issues during the sitting saliente, together with the ratification of the new pact of desarme nuclear start (strategic arms reduction treaty).
But william galston, of the institution brookings, warns that the successful cooperation in the apremiantes issues of the sitting saliente does not necessarily conducirán a continuous bipartidismo when the new 112do. congress reúna in january.
Said, on the contrary, it is very likely and until inevitable, that begin a period of desacuerdo.
"After the things that we must do are carried out, in the short term the psychology revertirá situation for one of confrontation" said.
Also wehner expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the civismo can lead to a genuine cooperation.
"I see the greater part of what sucederá between now and 2012 as a test for the acontecimiento main 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new majority republicana in the house and the voters in the tea party, which contribuyeron decisivamente to its creation.
For more awareness that have the leaders republicans on the dangers to exaggerate its position, know that must try to fulfil its promises of recortar expenditure the state and overturn the new law on health.
These lines partidarias already been observan clearly in iniciales reactions against the recommendations of the commission deficit, which include the reform of the code tributario and the increase of some taxes and the age of retirement, and the recorte of expenditure.
The copresidentes alan simpson and erskine bowles have been commissioned to one of the work more difíciles in washington and, according to its own assessment, have introducido to force the issue of the deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignorada.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 member states to publicar its plan as an official recomendación, and have been luchando to get close to this figure.
The greatest resistance is between officials elected in the panel, suggesting that there are, at least currently in issues fiscales, few foundations or desire for the compromise.
Galston predice two stages in the batallas between the republicans in the white house and the congress.
The first sucederá next year in the form of clashes partidarios, when the republicans desafíen obama on the budget, taxes and then the assistance médica, followed by a period of greater cooperation bipartidaria.
What would lead to the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partidismo of the recent election, a majority of americans still wants to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation conduce to a point died, as happened in 1995, then both parties observarán with attention the reaction of the people.
Anyone that consideren losing is probably cambiará course and buscará commitment.
However, this can be a vision optimista.
The partidismo and the polarización currently are greater than were to mediados years 1990, and it seems to have a hueco ideológico between obama and republicans largest of the congress of which had between president bill clinton and republicans in its time.
At the same time, the activistas of both parties see 2010 as the mero preludio to a more momentous choice in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo shows this week can be bienvenido by many americans.
But this requerirá much more effort from both sides to find points in common in the issues that are still divided.
A document american filtrado retrata to moscow as the paraíso corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracia," and leaves a part of the sobornos and protection that recauda money directly to the kremlin, as reported in february the us embassy in russia.
Is reported that both the police and the federal security service manejan huge chantaje systems, which helps to explain the high cost of life in moscow.
They recaudan money not only of business legítimos, but also of organised criminal groups.
Each of the burocracia stratum, what the prime minister vladimir putin has denominado "autoridad vertical," making its part as the money goes up in the level.
The note, which was sent to washington under the name of ambassador john beyrle, was published by wikileaks in their place on wednesday websites.
The note is based in sources whose nombres have been censurados.
It was written while yuri luzhkov still was mayor of moscow, and what great part of the blame corruption.
The president dmitry medvedev despidió in october, but has habido little evidence of a limpieza since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, yelena baturina, which has an important construction company, have refused sistemáticamente the accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won a number of demandas by libelo on such accusations.
In september, when a canal russian television i preguntaron on a documental that sugería that was corrupto, said: "is a madness, a patraña, a fastidio."
According to the surveys, the russians believe abrumadora that their society is corrupta.
But it is inusual find the details explicados detalladamente, who were already in the report of the embassy, and it is quite extraordinary that are the diplomáticos of a foreign country which do that.
"The eslabones directos government of the city of moscow with crime have led to some llamarlo" disfuncional ," and to say that the government works more as a cleptocracia that as a government, says the note.
"The criminals disfrutan elements of a" krysha " (a term of the world criminal and mafia which literalmente means" techo "or protection) traspasa the police, the federal security service (sfs), the ministry of internal affairs (mvd), and the office of the tax, as well as all the sectors of the burocracia government of the city of moscow.
"The analysts identifican a structure of three levels in the world criminal of moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the most high."
"The sfs, mvd and the milicia are on the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the inspectores corruptos are in the level more under."
"This is a ineficaz system in which the groups criminals llenan a vacío in some areas, because the town not proporciona some services."
The report says that the sfs recauda the money of larger businesses, and that the police points to the small comercios.
A source, stated the report, "explained that the dueños trade of moscow entienden that the best is to ensure the protection of the mvd and sfs (instead of the groups of organised crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power that the criminal groups, but also that are protegidos by the law."
"For this reason, the protection against pandillas criminals do not is more a priority."
The note notes that, while the recaudación of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has confesado that has made little progress.
The note of the embassy reports on men taking maletas, probably llenas of money in cash, within the same kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, medvedev must rely on the burócratas," he said georgy satarov, director of the group of experts indem in moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this burocracia."
"It does not belong to a political class, because there is a political class in russia."
Without the policy, without the opposition, without a separation of poderes, said, the corruption that is inevitable.
To national level, indem considers that the corruption costs to russia more than usd 300 billion per year.
In a recent survey on percepciones globales of corruption llevada out by the government transparency not international organisation, the country was classified as 154 (countries are classified in the less the more corrupto).
The disclosure of the note of the american embassy, which not happened until late at night when moscow, surely causará disgusto within the russian government, and in spite of that luzhkov can be culpado by the debilidades of moscow, could be an opportunity for the kremlin argumente that is solucionando the problem.
Entrevistado for the cnn by larry king, putin suggested that the documents wikileaks could be mentiras and reacted furiosamente by a revelation that stated that the american diplomáticos called batman and medvedev robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is relaciona with our interaction, which is an important factor of the domésticas policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honesto with you, not sospechamos that this would have done with such arrogancia, with such pressure and, you know, to be done in a way as inmoral."
The veterans of the jemeres rouge obliged to deal with the past
In a classroom specific débilmente iluminada, with walls manchadas and descascaradas, the director of the school secundaria anlong veng recordó the man who had built, the last leader of the jemeres rouge ta mok.
"Here all aman to ta mok."
"It was a good leader and preocupó for its people," said sreng kor ma, 42 years.
Known as "the carnicero" by its brutality during the government of the jemeres rouge, the comandante remains popular in this remota former fortaleza of the jemeres rouge in the north - west of camboya, where built hospitals, puentes and other infrastructure, and where still live thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the jemeres rouge rindieran before the government, the lealtad sustained by a long time is still finally desafiada in anlong veng.
In april, a local forum for the truth and the reconciliación permitió him to the victims enfrentaran publicly to the people who had participated in the regime.
In june, the government distribuyó here a book of text of school secundaria that for the first time i teaches the history of the jemeres rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in july, a court mixto united nations and camboya emitieron the first condemnation of a former member of the jemeres rouge, sentenciando the former head of the well - known centre of torture tuol sleng, kaing khek iev, better known as duch, 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, the anxiety has crecido between the veterans of the jemeres rouge of anlong veng, complicando the efforts for the reconciliación and its intentos reintegrarse to society camboyana.
"There is resentimiento and fear among the former jemeres rouge, but can do nothing," he said chhang youk, director of the centre of documentation camboya, an independent organisation that investiga the regime.
"For them, life under the jemeres rouge was gloriosa, but the regime has become a símbolo of evil."
"This is creating divisiones within families."
During the government of the jemeres rouge of camboya, between 1975 and 1979, were ejecutadas or murieron of hambre, disease or excessive work, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the vietnamitas invadieron and derrocaron the government liderado for pol pot, the wreck of the regime and their militares huyeron to the border of camboya with tailandia.
There launched a insurrección that lasted until the last movement to be rindió in december 1998.
As pol pot, nuon chea and ieng sary addressed the war of guerrillas from its foundations in the montañas and the selvas of western camboya, ta mok cultivó supporters in anlong veng.
But to mediados of the 90 years, after a peace agreement patrocinado by the un condujera to the country "s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of combatientes of the jemeres rouge began to desertar towards the government, culminando in the rendiciones of ieng sary in 1996, and nuon chea and khieu samphan in 1998.
Pol pot died of natural causes in 1998, and ta mok, who had resistido, was capturado by forces of the government in 1999 in the cercanas montañas dangrek.
Died in a prison phnom penh in 2006 while expected the process.
Without the support of their benefactores, the more old combatientes jemeres rouge fell into the common miseria absolute which is in the rural camboya, and many feel nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few officials elite of the jemeres rouge conservaron their jobs administrativos local to change on deponer weapons, the soldiers rasos remain agricultores pobres and not cualificados.
"This people has obtained few benefits of the rendición," he said sok leang of the centre for the justice and the public reconciliación, which offers foros throughout camboya, even in anlong veng.
"They have incorporated the ideología agraria utópica of the regime."
"Them were criados without any concept to make business."
Sor lim, 55, who is unió to the jemeres rouge when it was a teenager 1974, luchó in the selva close to anlong veng before dedicated to life as agricultor rice poor in 1998.
"Life with the jemeres rouge was well," he said.
"Ta mok gave of eating for all."
"But now it is difficult because we have to autoabastecernos life."
The current court of the jemeres rouge has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, is expected that the court to prosecute nuon begins chea, khieu samphan, ieng sary and his wife, ieng thirith, another former minister of the jemeres rouge.
The mandate of the court is the process to the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but has not said if perseguirá cases in addition to these four.
This is not servido much for calmar the miedos in anlong veng.
The recent media speculation has been centrado in im chaem, 64 years district, who was a head in the province of banteay meanchey during the government of the jemeres rouge at the end of the years 1970.
In 2007, she said to the researchers in the centre of documentation camboya that had supervisado the construction of the dam trapeang thma, a project in which thinks that have been killed thousands of workers forced.
During a late bochornosa recent, im chaem again of work in the camps to their home on pilotes timber in a way of land in the afueras of anlong veng.
When the sun arrojó sombras long on the pasto reseco, im chaem rehusó talk of its past in the jemeres rouge.
She said that if the court convocara is not presentaría.
"Camboya is in peace and stable," he said.
"If there is more procesamientos, there will be war."
The prime minister hun sen, which desertó of the jemeres rouge in 1978, has also advertido repeatedly that there will be inestabilidad if the court seeks to more sospechosos, although the experts and historians cuestionan.
"Camboya must cavar a agujero and sepultar last" said.
But deal with the past is precisely what camboya must do to make progress, said chhang youk, the centre of documentation.
"The reconciliación, according to khmer, is back to unir pieces rotos" said.
"Is our obligación together these pieces rotos so that we can understand."
The centre of the first green text approved by the government on the jemeres rouge, so - called "to history of democratic kampuchea," 75 pages.
Was distribuido in anlong veng in june as a suplemento the book of text the history of school secundaria of the ministry of education, which contains less than four pages on the jemeres rouge.
As in the greater part of camboya, young people of anlong veng know few details on the jemeres rouge, despite the vínculo of the city with the regime.
Valeak touch, 19 years, a student at school secundaria of anlong veng, said that the new text book ayudaba to students understand an important part of its history.
But their parents reaccionaron with scepticism when led the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book of text and the court," he said.
"They have sospechas because are not seguros on the amount of people who procesará the court."
This resistance has fact that the process of reconciliación is complex and difficult, said sok leang.
But the public foros, the book of text and the court are comenzando to produce a impact, stated.
Anyway, the jemeres rouge retain a charm poderoso here.
In the montañas dangrek, a path with too many malas herbs and covered of plastic bags desechadas conduce to a rectángulo of black hollín covered by a techo corroded of hojalata.
The body of pol pot was quemado here on a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea, 31 years, a vendedor cell on the verge of path, said that not much knew about the man who was cremado there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place van there to rezarle," said.
Was the birthday of nuom sothea, and later that decided walk until the place of the last day of rest pol pot, where dejaría a manojo of plátanos maduros with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus acepta renunciar to its reserve of uranio calificado for armamento
In a victory sorpresiva for the campaign of president obama to protect the material nuclear throughout the world, the government of belarus announced on wednesday that renunciará to its reserve of uranio highly enriquecido, a componente critical of the nuclear weapons.
The trato was revealed in a declaración conjunta published after the minister of foreign affairs hillary clinton rodham reuniera with the minister of foreign affairs belarussian sergei martynov, apart from a summit of security.
For years, the american government had been tratando of persuadir to belarus that renunciara its uranio highly enriquecido and it seemed that had reached a point without retorno last spring.
But the american officials i said at the washington post that are carried out a couple of operations clasificadas with belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranio calificado for belarusian armamento an installation of investigations.
This prepared the ground for the agreement on wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a civil servant, who spoke from the anonimato due to the confidencialidad the issue.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the summit of security nuclear of 47 nations chaired by president obama in april, which excluyó to belarus.
And so seen was a good logro ensure the invitation of the former republic soviética to the next summit in 2012.
"Really i felt fascinado by the fact that quisieran a place in the summit of security nuclear 2012."
"This demuestra that this process is working," he said ken luongo, president of the society for the global security, a group that promueve security nuclear.
Clinton said that the agreement is a very significant and important step given for belarus.
In april 2009 obama promised in prague protect all the material nuclear vulnerable throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the us government has helped to six countries deshacerse of all its uranio highly enriquecido.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries made under the administration of george w. bush.
At the time of the summit of security nuclear of, the belarussian president obama, alexander lukashenko, had declared that the nation never renunciaría to its uranio.
"We have conservado uranio highly enriquecido (hundreds of kilograms of what is básicamente uranio calificado for armamento) and the uranio under enriquecimiento," he said lukashenko at this moment.
"This is not our raw material... we are going to fabricar bombas sucias, and not going to vendérselas nobody."
"The usamos for purposes of research, is it."
However, belarus acercó to the united states a few months ago, indicando interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first tarea withdraw the uranio of belarus, in october, was particularly complicada, that the material had been slightly irradiado.
The officials said that was loaded in a special train that viajó more of an installation 2.000 km to russian for storage and eliminación.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on monday and was made in aircraft.
The american government gastó 13 million dollars for the tasks, and the greater part of the money usó to suministrarle belarus the installation of inquiries with uranio enriquecimiento under, that is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew bieniawski, an official of the department of energy that working in the reduction of global threat, said that "this was coordinado and orquestado with great care to strengthen the confidence" that condujo the agreement signed by clinton.
The james martin center for nonproliferation studies estimated this year that belarus poseía at least 40 kilograms of uranio calificado for armamentos, as well as hundreds of kilograms of uranio highly enriquecido.
Belarus is eliminar its reserve towards 2012 according to the declaración conjunta.
Relations between belarus and the united states have been tensas for years, mainly due to the represión áspera of lukashenko of human rights.
But the declaración wednesday suggested a potential détente.
It stated that "while with agrado welcomes the progress in these issues of global security, the united states and belarus recognised that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in belarus remains a central issue is to improve the bilaterales relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The spanish government will not put reparos flights of the cia
The spanish government will not put reparos flights of the cia with prisoners taliban and al - qaeda direction to guantánamo by spanish territory, as expressed in a telegrama us ambassador in madrid.
So reflejan documents filtrados (cables) by wikileaks the daily the country, where it adds that the then vicepresidenta first of the government, maría teresa fernández vega, asked that the spanish executive estuviese informed "being able to demonstrate that ejercían a surveillance apropiada on foreign aircraft that atraviesan spain."
In june 2006, following a report of the council of europe in which acusaba of complicity in prácticas contrarias to the human rights a dozen countries, including spain, there was a meeting between the former american ambassador eduardo aguirre and fernández of vega.
The vicepresidenta recognised that the report of the council "cogido the government of zapatero outside game" and insisted that spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"The vega stressed that spain has no reparos intelligence flights through spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informados" to avoid any be "pillados desprevenidos," relata aguirre in a cable.
Also the then titular, miguel ángel external moratinos, pointed out the spanish ambassador that the executive "wanted to give this matter the profile as low as possible, although, to be in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity of influence."
For its part, in january 2007, the fiscal vincent gonzález transmitió the embassy not to try to block the initiative of judge ask the desclasificación of the documents of the national centre of intelligence (cni) and the ministry of defence on the cia flights.
"These reports contain no element incriminatorio or any information sensitive," explained the embassy after talk with the tax.
However, us reflejó its concern about the "aparente coordinación between the spanish judge and the german fiscales," more than by the information desclasificada cni or the ministry of defence.
"This coordinación between independent researchers complicará our efforts to manejar the case discretamente between governments," regrets aguirre.
In march 2007 in a lunch meeting between the us ambassador and the interior minister, alfredo pérez rubalcaba, this commented that "although spanish judges are rabiosamente celosos of its independence and will do what consideren appropriate," he had given instructions to their colleagues "to evitasen comments of inflamada retórica, in an attempt by rebajar the temperatura."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the pp in this matter.
"Pese its orientación general proamericana, our experience suggests that the pp not dudará in capitalizar any indication that the government of zapatero toleró or deliberadamente us ignoró actions that pudieran be interpretadas as possible violations of human rights, even if they revelaciones have negative consequences for the us government," señala.

The popular ganarían 4 escaños in congress and the psc perdería 9
With the results of the 28 - n, the pp could be decisive in the municipios lérida tarragona and barcelona
Following the significant increase of votes and members experimentados in the recent elections autonómicas, the pp catalan already has the view in the general because, has adelanto or not, the prospects are more than positivas, because the number of votes which this training obtiene in these comicios usually doblar that receives in the catalanas.

These calculations constatarían that catalana square is fundamental to pp and psoe.
According to the analysis of the popular, erc perdería a member - now has three - while icv quedaría with a member or ganaría one.
But, of mantenerse the electoral timetable, the quotation more inmediata producirá in may of 2011 with the comicios municipales, where the popular can also be decisivos in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capital of province and in its place at the forefront of the diputación barcelona, one of the administrations that more budget handles - 661 million euros to 2011 -.

Given the debacle republicana, not would be descabellado that this training pierda its representación in the council barcelonés - is needed to obtain the 5% of the votes -.

The célula catalana facilitó thousands of passports to the qaida
In addition to the seven arrested in barcelona, tailandia there were three
The seven paquistaníes and the nigeriano arrested by agents of the directorate - general of the police information in barcelona formed a célula yihadista that led from tailandia, facilitaba passports to different groups of the qaida, including "the tigres for the release of the land tamil" (ltte) and "laskar and taiba" (let), author this last of the attacks of bombay that caused the death 106 people in 2008.
The ministry of the interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "operation kampai" has quedado "weakened" the apparatus of counterfeiting of the qaida at international level and, therefore, its capacity operativa ."
The researchers calculated that the célula, the two years that has been active in cataluña, has been able to send thousands of passports to tailandia, where were falsificados and then distribuidos the groups that integran the galaxia criminal the qaida so that their "combatientes" can cruzar the western european fronteras and other countries with total impunidad.
The célula destamantelada is not the only that the yihadista had operativa network in europe, hence that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the services tailandeses, other european police units, for what is not descarta that territory of the eu lleven out in the coming days blows similares developed in the evening last tuesday barcelona.
In coordinación with this operation (were arrested. paquistaníes junaid humayun, atiqur rehman, jabran asghar, malik iftikhar ahmad, mohammad saddique khan begum, tanveer arshad and the nigeriano babatunde agunbiade), in other tailandia developed with the captura of the paquistaníes muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the tailandés sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
These were that levelled in bangkok célula asentada in spain and in other european countries.
The catalana network - part of it was golpeada in 2009 - robaba mainly to tourists passports that cumplían with the requisitos marked by the so - called "global deal islámico."
That is to say, the documents should be in the name of varones of between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas estampadas.
In means of the research stresses that, in time, no dato has been found that vincule arrested in cataluña with the bombay attack, pese to the author of this attack, "laskar and taiba," has been one of the groups receptores passports robados in spain and then falsificados tailandia.
However, cabe remember that days before outside committed this attack, from cataluña were enviados through a transferencias a thousand dollars that were agency "invertidos" in the purchase of mobile cards that then were used by the members of the "commando" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police has incautado abundante documentation.
The pp requires more to aparque the concert tax
The leader of the ppc, alicia sánchez - camacho, had opportunity yesterday to exponerle personalmente artur over its conditions to support its investidura as president of the generalitat, idénticas already planteadas during the campaign and summary in giving priority to the recuperación of the economy and prescindir aventuras filo - soberanistas, as is the concert economic that the leader nationalist wants to plantear in ecuador of his mandate.
The president of the popular catalanes came on the meeting of artur more with the security that gives have obtained 18 members in the elections last sunday, figure more than enough to be done to, because the ciu needs that at least one of the candidate formaciones that ejercerán the opposition abstenga in the vote of investidura.
Of a possible entente with the pp depend on the futuras alianzas that the nationalists want to keep the congress when elections are held in general, but of time, the talks that these days maintains more with the rest of political leaders are made in key catalana.
And in what respecta to the president of the pp, to support a investidura "will be aparcar all the speeches soberanistas and independentistas," as well as the economic - similar concert of the basque country - that the leader convergente seeks to even someter referendum.
Both leaders have in common their political commitment to adelgazar the apparatus of a autonómica very inflada administration and the eliminación of tax sucesiones and donaciones.
Of the details of the negotiation on the investidura of more ocuparán, on the part of the ppc, jordi cornet and dolors montserrat.

The geriátrico says that the deaths were not by "lack of measures"
The dueños the centre of olot not descartan that their celador matara more than 11 ancianos
The responsible for the geriátrico caritat olot (gerona) offered a rueda yesterday of the press to highlight the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of joan vila dilmé, enfermero that while was killed at least there used to eleven ancianos that had his office.
The director of the residence, joan chamber, compareció acompañado letrado the centre, the lawyer joan cañada, and announced that "the wish of the caritat would be able to ejercer accusation against the responsible" but "legalidad and the responsibility of the deaths obligan us to take the situation procesal responsible civilians."
And it is also of the social desprestigio that can suffer the entity for not having detectado to time criminal activities of the celador, the great threat to the caritat cobra now form of sustanciosa compensation which are already calculando legal representatives of the family of the victims.
Joan vila dilmé has confesado that the first crime is remonta august 2009, and that since then has not left to kill.
The judge already pointed out in the auto ordenaba the exhumación of eight cuerpos - old patients of the geriátrico - that sospechaba that in many cases no doctor exploraba personalmente to the fallecidos but which, according to the age and the patologías of patients, despachaba the trámite by telephone.
The caritat yesterday, through its director, refused outright this extremo and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time, the cause of what has happened."
The advocate of the caritat added that "in the cause not only there is a indicio that action has habido imprudente by any other person who is not the defendant" itself.
The bautizado as "the death ángel confessed anteayer 11 asesinatos and detalló that the first crime committed the 29 august 2009 to, a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case caused the death pinchándole an overdose of insulina, unlike the first crime that we made ayudándose a mixture of pastillas sedantes.
The director of the caritat points which is complicated control that the personnel from the centre has access to the medicamentos.
The pinchazos insulina and the cocktail of sedantes would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the enfermero, in its afán to alleviate the sufrimiento of the internal, used for darles death.
But will be the analysis that are doing in the laboratory which must aclarar if vila not miente and buscó for its first victims a death less cruel or if, on the contrary, the abrasó by within dándoles lejía as has already confesado did with the three women that killed between 12 and 17 october.
In the caritat not to give credibility to the demonstrations of celador, or even the number of asesinatos confesados, that does not descartan is higher, and justifican its attitude in the different versions which has given vila in their visits the tried and in the little sense that has to cambie its way to proceed after having committed, with success, eight asesinatos.
It is for that to say that is put at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this suceso.
The bce threat
The investors reaccionaron sharply yesterday to the threat of trichet yesterday that advertía "the markets must not underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The diferenciales periféricos have closed with force and the actions of the european banks have subido more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the capacity of the bce of equivocarse and the euro has repuntado which is hardly a signal preocupante.

Bull network triunfa in f1 with a secret weapon of siemens
A software diseña mejoras in the coches in real time.
Since bull network irrumpió in the world of the fórmula 1 in 2004, its history in this selecto universe of the speed has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment nobody took into consideration the options of a escudería newly arrival and, in spite of the ascendente trajectory of recent seasons, last november, in the recta end of the championship all bet for the triumph of ferrari of fernando alonso.
Finally campeón without desmerecer the skill as pilot, the german sebastian vettel, nor the capacity of motor renault that propulsa her car, in the world of the fórmula 1 has become a legend "weapon" secret that the multinacional siemens has put in the hands of bull network to make in a team winner.
It is in reality of a powerful simulación software processes that the german put in the market in 2007 with very remote from the high competition automovilística purposes.
Denominado plm, this poderoso instrument informático has been used to design cadenas assembly of fábricas manufactureras throughout the world, plantas of energy, instruments of high precision.
The aim is to reproduce, simular faithful the product or the process before construirlo real way, avoiding this way fallos and expenditure evitables.
Plm has facilitado the development of the fotográficas of fees, chambers of aircraft sukhoi or of the coches nissan utilitarios more célebres.
Siegfried industrial russwurm, responsible for the division of siemens, explains that the use of this instrument informático in its factoría fórmula 1 has enabled bull network to design and lead to effect "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modificaciones, changes and mejoras that detectan during the careers and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the escuderías in the year 1992 had an average of 10 técnicos in your team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four mejoras in vehicles during each season.
In the team of bull work today 180 young professionals network of high cualificación, equipped with potentes computer equipment, analizan and proyectan whole fate of modificaciones in the bólidos.
The directivo siemens explained that software plm is able to analyse and improving all the elements of the bólidos bull network with the exception of motor, which is the entire responsibility of renault.
Is modifican materials, the fuel, the aerodinámica and elements of security.
The changes can be taken by the virtual reality of the simulador to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through lasers and autoclaves of high technology.
As a single limitation this madness of technological perfeccionamiento is the figure of usd 40 million which each team of fórmula 1 may spend a maximum in each season in order to facilitate the competition.
Bull network has montado the factory in high technology to design and produce its bólidos in a town to 50 kilometres of london.
These are two buildings in which are restringidas visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that there acontece is considered "high secret."
The plantilla for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two pilotos, the campeón vettel and mark webber.
The héroe of the fórmula 1 bull network, without doubt, is the recent campeón sebastian vetell.
Between the immense resources tecnológicos that the mark of energéticas beverages has since service of their participation in the circuits, they esconden other protagonistas whose competition is inestimable and its notoriedad nula.
The head of technology of the factory, steve nevey, says that five years i could say that the avances + d in the coches of carretas aportaban 50% of the victorias and the pilotos were responsible for the rest.
These porcentajes have variado today and the technology sum 85% of success, while the pilotos aportan 15% of value added.

Sabadell bid by "robar" a million customers to their rivales in three years
More optimista other directivos, the consejero delegado of sabadell bank, jaime guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a year hard for the banking, but descarta inicialmente a new crisis of liquidity and vaticina the end of the war in pasivo.
Pese to this, provides for a desplome of the márgenes of interests, which is intentarán compensar in part with subidas of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expected catch in three years a million customers, individuals, their asignatura pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and power sobrevivir in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank pondrá in place in 2011 a new plan director who will have a duration of three years.
The objective, in addition to sobrevivir without need to recurrir public aid of frob, is gain market share with the captación of a million new customers - 700.000 if it descuentan which can get out of the bank -, its great asignatura pending, that until now had mimado more at the pymes and that the customer minorista companies.
This year has captado 250.000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their share of the market in particular is 3.5%, while in companies supera 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011 plan - 2013 is the commitment by productivity, or what is the same, austeridad, with reduction of costes as objective, and whose retos expondrá the bank when present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to fijarse objectives and hacerlos public already that the financial crisis has trastocado all the plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, in fact, cerrará this year, its director optima plan, set four years ago, although inicialmente was to three, but the situation of the markets did that ampliará a exercise more.
The customers that stop escape the savings banks will be its main objective.
In a breakfast organised by the apie, guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a year "difficult and far - reaching."
The executive, in fact, believes that the departure of the crisis in spain "will be lenta."
Furthermore, in two or three years will be very difficult to create employment ," something essential for the survival of the banking, insisted business.
And, although believes that the war in pasivo - that penaliza márgenes - is reducing, the price of the primas risk which are paying banks and for their emisiones boxes to obtain liquidity are relocating already to the price of the credit for compensar the fall of the márgenes.
"The issue of liquidity and the funding is estructural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not closed the grifo, but the diferenciales are highest," recognised guardiola.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on thursday to limit the long - term credit and suban the price of the diferenciales - see cincodías of 22 and 27 november -.
Also recognised that the trend of banking now "is to subir committees," but there is a "competitive framework."
The director of sabadell plan is based in the growth orgánico, although, as always, the group does not descarta corporativas operations.
Not in vano, ensures that in spain "will requerir tamaños greatest."
"Next year is going to move all," he assured.
He says that the needs of capital are "subido immensely" and not descarta that some spanish between financial entity in numbers rouge.
And points that the frob can meet the market in the captación of funds to new recapitalizaciones.

The ceca descarta a second oleada of mergers in the boxes
The director - general of the ceca, josé antonio olavarrieta yesterday that will producirse, removed a oleada mergers of savings banks and insistir again in the speed with which is ejecutando the restructuring of the sector.
When the process of concentration of the arrancó savings banks españolas, were several entities that ensured that not participarían in this first stage and that reservarían for the second round.
However, the director - general of the spanish confederación savings banks (ceca), josé antonio olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that this new oleada operations will producirse.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporación cajasol the group of banking cívica you cannot say that there is is a second round, which are ajustes."
"The greater part is completely made; instead of 17 may go to 13 ó 14 but all the major processes have already done and tutelados by the bank of spain, which in that has worked much also," the directivo.
In statements during a breakfast of the executive and directivos association of aragón (adea), olavarrieta has expuesto that the process of concentration is acometiendo "to the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfechos as will be produciendo the deadlines that in its day, not now, is marcaron in the business plans with the bank of spain," enfatizó.

Olavarrieta recognised that "there are a number of opinions very little afortunadas on the lentitud of process" that demuestran "a lack of seriousness and sense," because "what does the bank of spain is remember that we have to be before the end of the year within the term."
The director - general of the ceca josé antonio olavarrieta, assured yesterday that spain has the financial system more riguroso across europe and "probably" of the world, and atribuyó to those who put in tela of trial a "lack of conocimiento."

Also recordó that the spanish banking went very well closure of the evidence of stress that realizó bce in july.
Zapatero and the german red line
Berlin has optado by mantenerse in the euro, but has established the conditions for the entire union.
The tensiones government in the markets have provocado a double response.
On the one hand, josé luis rodríguez zapatero has avanzado new ajuste measures, since reducciones fiscales to the pymes, regulation of private agencies of colocación or supresión of the 426 euros in aid to parados without provision, until the privatisation of 49% of aena, the management of the airports of cold and the prat and 30% of loterías of the state.
On the other, the vicepresidenta elena salgado, with the support of the expresidente felipe gonzález, has sumado the criticism to the cancillera angela merkel on its responsibility in desatar the current crisis.
How is that interpretar these movements?
Go ahead that the position of merkel is not a mistake in its policy comunicativa.
On the contrary, is another round of tuerca in the difficult process of redefinición of the euro.
And that germany has a radicalmente new vision of what must be its future, that choca with that of maintaining the antiguas tradiciones good part of its partners.
Against the european resistencias, in germany comienza especularse on the three possible salidas to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by that same, austria and holanda, among other countries, while the south abandonaría the monetary area.
The second, the recuperación the framework, although now seem science fiction, with a very favourable aware of the opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a rediseño of the euro, in line with the proposals germanas of greater control macroeconómico, rigor presupuestario, multas to countries transgresores, possible suspensiones of payments of some of them and extension of the private sector of the costes ajustes potential.
The german position is clear and are definiéndose for a long time, so that now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the fmi as the european commission estimulaban déficits, the german government pulled out of the hat a reform constitucional to impedirlos from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergencia between what germany creía that tax should be done (rigor plans and stability in the public finances), and what were practicando their european partners, including france.
The second in the front gave the country centroeuropeo when merkel alargó penosamente the decision of rescue grecia.
Since then was the subject of feroz criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in germany and public opinion and the published were very against the rescue of grecia.
Finally, in recent days of october, new merkel emerges with a clear position, exigiendo the reform of the treaties of the union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to force the prestamistas private to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpretado as antieuropea, as has precipitado the irish crisis and all the other.
But its proposal, although a both edulcorada, has been adopted and, in the next few months, we should attend to the process of reform of the union that posibilite those measures from the 2013.
Germany has trazado a red line that we do not think cruzar.
And is saying to us all that, although now has to take measures with which perhaps is not very agree, from that date the former functioning of the euro, will be finished.
The 2013 significará the birth of a new monetary area, in the countries infractores will be severely sancionados, can be forced to declararse suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector also correrá with part of the cost.
Germany is señalando that we must continue a severe path with high rates of growth and investment, moderación in consumption, mejoras savings in the productivity and competitiveness and external saldos positive.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous agujeros in the balanza of payments, as the spanish has chaired the growth in the years of boom, simply not the will tolerar.
The envite is clear.
And we would be wrong in not entenderlo.
It is not only of reconducir the public deficit to 3% in the 2013.
What we require is much more hard.
And the worst that in these circumstances podríamos do is engañarnos ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence stop step to a greater calm.
And that aprovechemos ventana opportunity that we have given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president zapatero also has understood and its double manifiesto (reforms prometidas after the meeting last saturday with large companies and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggests that, pese to the criticism merkel, has been open way tesis of which must be put at home.
But the red line that germany has trazado there is, and does not seem that the vayan to move.
And, between the possibilities that contemplan, to abandon a monetary zone too atiborrada of countries little serios, cannot excluirse.
Then, germany always we can say that we had avisado.
Sport and fraud of law
Tretas as the alonso and ramos before the ajax demuestran ingenio but will not escape to a sanción.
The expulsion presuntamente urdida by two players of the real madrid (xabi alonso and sergio ramos) in the disputado party on 23 november against the ajax in the champions league has provocado that escriban ríos of tinta about whether or not such behaviour is antideportivo and, possibly, if both players should be sancionados by uefa.
As is well sabido, lack of a few minutes to end the (that your team had already clearly won party), the two players lost deliberadamente time to the time to draw sendas faults to lead the árbitro they show the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the real madrid already acabará as leader of his group, both players cumplirán the sanción reglamentaria next liguilla party, against the auxerre card, clean and will be able to move to the next stage.
Finally, the committee of disciplina of uefa has punished with the two parties to the coach, josé mourinho team, and with different economic cantidades the players involved.
The provocación of a yellow card or similares in circumstances such as this is not a new, but rather frequent practice in the world of football.
It is so extendida that form part of the ethos, of the rules escritas, but seguidas, not this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case relatado must be to has been protagonizado by a team of the body of the real madrid (which in its presume of nobleza anthem and honour, and that in times pasadas has multado their players for acts análogos) and the dramatización orquestada, apparently, for mourinho, who adds an episode more to his dilatada history of technical histriónico and provocador.
In any case, the debate revolves around if this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradice the principles of sport, is to say, if with these actions comete fraud of law; because, in effect, are actions respetuosas with the sports regulation, but seem to eludir its sense.
The issue is to examine the kind of damage that provocan the spirit of sport.
One of the goods that understands the spirit of sport is the integridad física of players contrarios, aspect that with these actions was not in danger, in other words, there was no stake violent.
Another of these goods to the alude clean with the game is to prevent the team of unfair to the players infractores take advantage of the team contrary, which does not happened.
Well now, the paradox of the action of the players of the real madrid is that this is not acomodó what normally caracterizamos as trampa or fraud of law, because its violación of the rules are not made to escondidas to try to avoid the sanción, but that precisely its action tried to be more obvious to receive the punishment of árbitro.
Esperaban and accepted gustosamente the sanción.
Another issue is what kind of get the infractores advantage on the faults examinadas intentional.
Here it seems necessary constatar that are not coloca in situation desventajosa the rival or obtiene benefit in the same party, because obviously the result of the action is make the own team with less players.
And nor is a useful strategy for the next, because the club party will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage, obviamente, is that the players empezarán the next phase of the league of champions without cards that can amenazar its participation in a future party.
But this is a long - term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminación, because the team can be eliminado to the first change, and also with this action the sanción and pasan cumplen players a party to the second ciclo cards, in which the suspension by acumulación cards are produced with a less than in the first ciclo.
So that, to go pasando rondas, is not so clear that is an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the spirit of sport, which itself is part take decisions estratégicas favorezcan to reap the maximum advantage of enabling the rules.
In the course which concerns us, the players not actuaron to evadir the implementation of the sanción (this yes would be a clear case of fraud law), but rather that elected when someterse to it.
Tomaron a decision estratégica without sortear the punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between the ingenio and the law is difusa fraud, on this occasion i believe that it was a clear case of ingenio.
The controversy, it seems to me, for two factores arises: because it was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which was carried out the transmission of the directriz provocarlas.
The damage provocado to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and estético.
Ofensiva offers to attract the cenas navideñas of groups in bcn
The dictadura timetable concentrated this year a avalancha of reserves for on 16 and 17.
Proliferan the celebrations autosufragadas by employees, who want to spend eur between 20 and 30.
As the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of december also back the cenas grupales previas to the navidad, which are still ejerciendo ball of oxígeno for the restoration and the ocio barcelona, but that because of the crisis have desembocado in a ofensiva of prices tight in order to attract the customer majority: almost all want to spend eur between 20 and 30 in cenas or meals, coinciden the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.

As is happening from 2008, when began the stage of vacas flacas, many businesses have eliminado collective cenas by presupuestaria issue.
Not to prescindir of the tradition, many workers the mantienen paying their own pockets.
Is which is the coyuntura, and other require batalla prices, confirms the president of gremi restauració of barcelona, gaietà farràs.
The representative of the patronal, today, not dares to vaticinar how will the celebrations of this month.
"The people will think long before reservar."
"Wants to leave, but has the alertas encendidas on the issue of the prices," points.
The business irá well "to those who give quality good price and with good service," adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a escalón with the crisis, so that the strip around eur 25 has become mayoritaria in demand.
In a survey in various establecimientos céntricos constata the collapse of petitions to the night of 17.
In the group soteras indicate that there is a auténtico boom of solicitudes for this friday, with the pretensión to spend less than eur 30, what have respondido adaptando their menús to the coyuntura, with fórmulas full eur 25 to 35.
In another of the andilana more potentes groups, with 16 establecimientos in the city (hostal of the rita, market, the fonda and other), the peculiaridad the timetable has conllevado more reserve anticipada, even since the beginning of november.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menús for all the gustos from eur 19,95 until 30," detallan.
In an grup, which abandera the mussol, attic, ququ, and until a total of 23 local, mantienen optimistas after detect a rise of the facturación since the second half and a good, although concentradas, prospects of business for the navidad.
Sources of the group destacan that 18 will also be a day hiperactivo level of groups of friends that precelebran the fiestas.
One navideño aggregate of its six menús group have, with the eur 30 or more as budget and the percepción that there are predisposición star to spend a 10% more than last year to change exigir more details, as cava.
We also see brotes greens in some companies that again invitar their employees and feeling that the volume of the groups is something more.
On the part of the patronal fecasarm (which includes entities such as the association of bares, restaurants and ocio of barcelona), its vice - president, enric gomà, confident in start to see the end of the túnel and maintains that in all the reservations are "animadas," although the customers "negocian the maximum."
That yes, the ilusión by the celebrations has not descendido, pague who pague, indicates.
The programme nuclear paquistaní generates great inquietud in us
Islamabad produces weapons atómicas "a faster pace that any other country."
The filtraciones wikileaks confirm the vínculos between the taliban and pakistán.
The content of the correspondencia between the us embassy in pakistán and the us department of state filtrada by the portal wikileaks confirms the enormous inquietudes that causes in washington nuclear programme paquistaní.
Apart from the esclarecedores and jugosos details that offer on the content of the talks and the thoughts of the representatives diplomáticos americans accredited in islamabad, the documents revelan that cooperation between the two countries in the field of security atómica, in time to go on the increase, "decrece," and that the inestable asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster pace than any other country of the world."
The particularity of the programme nuclear paquistaní - that the weapons are not ensambladas but that remain stored by components to dificultar its destrucción in case of attack - - is one of the main reasons desvelo in washington.
As well as enumera embajadora in pakistán, anne w. patterson, in a report up to the visit of the then consejero of national security, james jones: "the nuclear proximidad of some instalaciones territory under attack talibán, the rumoreada dispersión of materials and the vulnerabilidad the transport of nuclear materials atómicos."
The high number of people implicadas in the arsenales and in the nuclear programmes of missiles is contemplado, not only for us, but also by russia, as proliferante and reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistán has had to contratar staff with estrictas creencias nuclear religiosas to protect the instalaciones; given the fall of the educativos and cultural levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities of reclutar to people who trabaje in the nuclear programmes or missiles," said the expert yuri korolev, the russian ministry of foreign, in a meeting with their homólogos americans.
What is more novedoso the documentation filtrada for the portal of julian assange is the ever less cooperation between us and pakistán in issues of proliferación nuclear and the high rate paquistaní production of nuclear weapons.
An office of the embassy in may, which califica "frustrante" communication with pakistán, says: "the transparency is frecuentemente inexistente; the offers of aid are unanswered or are descartadas."
In other message, peter lavoy, official of the national intelligence to southern asia, constata that "despite the economic disaster, pakistán produces nuclear weapons to a faster pace than any other country of the world."
The embajadora patterson also calls on washington, during a visit of head of the army, the general ashfaq kayani, very clear that deje "" to responsible that "the pakistán army must end with the support tácito terrorist groups."
To the caza of the head of wikileaks
Obama nombra to a high responsible for the fight antiterrorista to prevent new filtraciones.
Interpol emite a red alerta in order to continue the movements and localizar to assange where is.
Everything relacionado with wikileaks and its founder, julian assange, form a complicated laberinto where it is difficult to have certeza on the facts.
Yesterday interpol emitió a "red alerta" to "localizar and continue the assange movements."
However, it is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Furthermore, it is not new, but that dates back of 20 november.
And does not have to do with the last filtración of more than a quarter of us million documents diplomáticos but with the accusations of that the australian afronta in suecia sexual abuse.
In addition, the creator of wikileaks lawyer, mark stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact with mr assange."
Was the day 20 when the international police body with its headquarters in lyón (france) dictó order at the request of suecia, but not the revealed until yesterday, after receiving autorización of the authorities of that country.
So things, the 188 countries of interpol have indicaciones identify or localizar to assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradición."
Although the interpol cannot ordenar the arrest of an individual countries affected by a red alerta, many of the member states, according to the organisation has explained, yes consider the so - called network notice free way to proceed to a national arrest - - must acometer the body of police, especially if have an agreement bilateral extradición, as is the case of suecia and inglaterra, where it believes that is assange.
The assange movement has outraged to lawyers, that publicaron a letter yesterday denouncing the founder of wikileaks, 39 years, has been shown willing to respond by videoconferencia to the questions of the suecas authorities.
Remember also that assange requested and obtained permission to leave suecia of the taxation of their case, to which comparan with the mítico lavrentiy pavlovich beria, head of security stalin.
"This seems a cacería, not a legal persecution," denuncia the misiva.
While the world search - and from australia their mother defiende the inocencia of his son - - assange continues in whereabouts unknown, but not callado.
On monday granted from a place indeterminado an interview to the director of time through skype magazine, a conversation in the who asked the resignation of the us secretary of state, hillary clinton.
"If it can show that was responsible for ordenar to diplomáticos americans that espiaran in the un violando international treaties that us has signed, should resign," said.
Its opinion was denostada yesterday by the secretary of the press of the white house, robert gibbs, which described "ridícula and absurda" the request of resignation.
"I am not sure why we must all import the opinion of a type with a web page" stated in the chain cnn.
The obama has commissioned a high itself responsible for the fight antiterrorista, rusell travers, to prevent new fugas of documents.
The attempt of the mouthpiece of the president barack obama restar importance to assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaman politicians and comentaristas conservatives.
Peter king, congressman that from january presidirá the committee of national security in the house low, has asked the department of state that estudie the possibility of include wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to intervene and their funds and perseguir any that are of any contribution or aid."
More far still has gone tom flanagan, a asesor by president canadian stephen harper, which has had to retractarse after say that assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should make in objective and use a plane not tripulado or something."
Who is not disculpó was mike huckabee, minister baptista, exgobernador arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Who is in the government which leaked information is guilty of traición and any thing that is not the implementation would be a punishment too amable," in the chain fox declared.
Puigcercós seeks peace in erc with guiños the related to carod
The leader republican party permitirá a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural ejecutiva and the end of the asambleario system.
Joan puigcercós seems to have hallado the receta for sortear the internal enésima revolt in the filas of erc, without north by the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that its resignation is insuficiente straight to the related to the exlíder josep lluís carod - rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluida as their own mentor and that it can cause in all the quebraderos head that had with other currents extintas.
Therefore, the leader of esquerra intentará ganarse to the new critical with guiños permitan blindarse until the elections municipales.
To begin with, puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national consejeros erc can pronunciarse on their continuity in secret.
Through papeletas, and not to hand alzada.
If the carodistas want to vehicular true vote of punishment of the president, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of filas wants to avoid the image of both as the division of sometimiento of their person.
In several interviews, said that it is not consideraría ratificado with half more one of the votes, but added, without precisar porcentajes, that it would be good not a result "to the búlgara."
The next carod require the president something more to put its position at the disposal of the militancia, a gesture that not applies when puigcercós controls the maximum body between congresos.
But the availability of the majority not enough to forzar dimisiones, are going to try acordar with the ejecutiva a road map here in may.
For this, expect participate in the drafting of the document of reorientación estratégica that the direction someterá national vote of the council the day 18.
Its intention is avalar puigcercós to change that this prometa forward autumn the congress to the 2011, something that the cúpula already gives by fact.
The leader of erc recognised that the "polifonía" damages the stability and that its aim is to do that, once and for all, the organisation is capable of lavar the trapos sucios doors towards within.
In this line, it is sintomático the article that the conseller in - office josep huguet signed in your blog.
The ideólogo of puigcercós considered, titular of innovació gave on the fact that the change of various objectives will be refrendado "leader."
And enumeró five, of which destacan two.
The first, the ejecutiva "recomponer" to that represente at least 90% of the militancia, namely include faces new that provengan of afín to carod sector.
The second may be the great innovation.
Huguet proposes that erc liquide once the asambleísmo as functioning mechanism.
So, propugna a reform of the estatutos that enable us to hold the congresos through delegados elected by sufragio.
Ending up with the asambleario model, an exception in the system of spanish, has been a obsesión parties of the puigcercós team, which already batalló in this respect in the last two congresos.
In fact, the convulso cónclave 2008 made the request to the direction of reviewing the asambleísmo in a specific congress of reform of estatutos.
This quotation is still pending, because the internal marea of recent years desaconsejaba afrontar the matter.
Now, without critical sectors in the acecho, can be a good time to retomarlo and try cerrarlo forever.

The dedo in the llaga... "we aprietos," espetó dulcemente the writer argentina the public, mayoritariamente of young people, who gave quotation in the book fair international guadalajara (fil) to hear this table redonda moderate by marisol shultz and where participaron valenzuela, sergio ramírez, mayra montero and luis garcía montero.
Luisa valenzuela leyó a text that devoted to gonzalo celorio and that shultz definiría after as a great cuento, with luisa in the first person as leading in search of knowing what is the "llaga," of medical doctor, of the that will not obtiene answers although yes pistas in the same hilo narrativo.
In the infectólogo emerges convinced: "the paciencia is not my strong, perhaps it is my llaga."
At the end, then a frustrado acercamiento with the traumatólogo that has been stolen the aliento in half of the corridor, but who will clarifies that llaga is not a scientific term; it is the psicoanalista who revela the misterio: "the real llaga is open, it is the cicatriz" symbolic.
The leading suspiró aliviada and concluded "of the llaga only logré know that is what real open and that there is no," but convinced that the placeres and the trampas of the language must be very entreverados.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The nicaragüense sergio ramírez also expuso a deleitosa narración that tituló elogio of the invención, where the dedo in the llaga not been nombra but at a time discovered.
With pinceladas of realismo mágico, account of a famous hechicera, that the same tocaba clouds, traía back to men who had gone far or reparaba the virtudes that had lost a doncella, narración viró to speak then america, the great novel which does not faltaron their own cronistas from the outset that the contaran and quoted bernal díaz castillo who critica the excesses of told by the capitanes conquistadores.
"Cervantes that inventó us all (writers) burla of witnesses fingidos that aparecían did in the stories presentadas as real, but otherwise never have come to count the history of america with imaginación to which i faltaba until the modesty."
However, stressed "are the locos and the embusteros which better imaginan" and it is where converge reality and mentira, where no longer knows that of the narrado belongs to a bando or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogeo.
What is called in fact the "tradition cervantina."
"Yours heritage are what is."
In its time, the writer mayra montero acotó and aplaudió variedad of interpretations that gave the invitation of the fil with its bureau redonda dedo in the llaga.
The cubana - puertorriqueña pointed out the suyo towards the great social llaga of violence in their country - and comparte latinoamérica - product of the disputas traffic and sale of drugs.
"I believe that the good literature, the good poetry, good songs encierran a compromise tácito that of course is not premeditado," said, the reality of the literature following quote that is the commission and the dimension of the compromise that was established between author and readers, and that in a "reaction química" of this last.
The evening closed the spanish poet luis garcía montero whose speech was also that dedo "emphasis in the llaga writer committed the writer."
Considered that in a world living prisa, also in the customs intellectuals and control of conciencias that redunda in dogmatismos, olvidando "that behind every statement there is a small not and behind each negación there is a small yes."
"To be dueños of our thinking and be dueños the reality we have to matizar: and matizar means many times to the dedo in the llaga and molestar to those people who are much more cómodas thinking in caricatura, in black and white, ideas establecidas and without matiz and molestar also to the poderes prefieren a world in black and white," said, invitando to regain the sense of write.
Romano is by its first title
Rubén omar romano account with three derrotas end, has had altibajos in his career, but has already sabido achieve in three times the number decisiva.
With the grief of santos laguna and monterrey in the end, also face two different estilos marked by their técnicos, who find between yes with a contraste marked by the results.
Rubén omar romano account with three derrotas end, has had altibajos in his career, but has already sabido achieve in three times the number decisiva, although until now has been in white and is therefore that this occasion is a very special for him.
The argentino has finished consolándose with the medalla of the subcampeón, has quedado a step backwards from the ganadores and end consecutivas curiously with the same team has played.
The estratega santista came to its first end as coach in the torneo opening 2002, when was the riendas morelia with the global which fell by 4 - 2 to toluca; then, in the closing 2003 also came to grief decisive and also the lost with global of 3 - 1 and was precisely to rayados.
Already with santos laguna, in the torneo bicentenario 2010, once again to the diablos, rubén again suffer a revés, since its team ended empatado 2 - 2 to the choriceros after 210 minutes of the game, but in the tanda pénaltis was advantage by 3 - 1 with two opportunities for sellar the title to finally three players suyos fallaron since the 11 steps and suffered the voltereta 4 - 3.
Rubén already lost two end with the diablos rouge and a monterrey, its rival in time, therefore does not suffer the same fate, seeks to emerge from the maleficio and be able to celebrate for the first occasion a title for him, although says that the most important is the institution.
"I want to emerge campeón, no statistics, this is why i want to break a club, by a afición to which i must and consequently vendrá the title for my, but what previous is more important," said the timonel when it cuestionó about the numbers that has against playing end.
Very vigente has the end of the former, which ensures, has learned much, "the only education that we can have is that until the árbitro silbe the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the raya, the players also, because the previous time, with two criminal by throwing already were prepared to emerge corriendo and i believe that this is not a teaching, until the end of the party we can celebrate."
Know that this number could definirse in shot criminal, something that does not worry, because hopes in their players: "one never seeks to reach the tanda of regular criminal, one seeks to conclude in time, but sometimes there is no other and we must be prepared, in the previous torneo estuvimos prepared, desafortunadamente we made a bad jugada the destination, sometimes by the nervios or the anxiety of having the title in the hands, but it was us, that we left something to this end that esperemos does not come to this body."
Romano has in its hands fail to be a technical subcampeón and test for the first time the glory that give the qualifications.

450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro - quebec has concedido contracts directos by a value of 450 million dollars to engineering companies for the project hydroelectric eastmain - 1 - to - sarcelle - rupert.
In the centre of this avalancha of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formado by businesses bpr, dessau, groupe sm and axor, which has obtained without a tender previa the most important contract, the management of the project, by a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called énergie gérance, was created in 2004 raíz the decision of hydro - quebec rely in the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project hydroelectric of 5.000 millions of dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium énergie gérance obtained the lucrativo contract without that realizase previously a public tendering.
For the quebequense party, the ethical recourse to consorcios of companies plantea a serious problem that threatens to eliminar competition and cause a subida prices.
"It is a new method of colusión and eliminar competition."
"That is to say, the people, instead of doing so in secret, now make openly," said yesterday the member of the party quebequense sylvain simard in a rueda of the press.
Later, in the morning, mr simard planteó the issue in the national assembly because, according to says, does not understand how we can benefit the public interest in this way.
The minister of natural resources, nathalie normandeau, responded by the late, denying firmemente has produced a colusión with this contract.
"Empiezo to cansarme," protestó, defendiendo that the pq had actuado so "deshonesto" and "with lack of rigor."
He said that "the minimum" would be that the pq disculpase.
The fórmula of the consorcios is a common practice in the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The draft eastmain presents a high level of complejidad, bearing in mind the scale of the works.
The works already have begun and durarán until 2012.
In particular the case, the contract has been concedido without entrase in stake competition; it has treaty of a negotiation.
In addition, the fórmula of the consorcios has ceased to be the exception to the rule in quebec, even for relatively sencillos projects.
As publicaba last week i devoir, the fórmula of the consorcios in the sector of the asesoramiento technical is still sometida a research in the government.

In this way, the company dessau working in partnership with the majority of its main competidores, as top +, génivar, snc - lavalin, roche et tecsult, and others.
Each combinación, and there are dozens of them, conduce to a single person, namely dessau legal.
In what respecta consortium énergie gérance, the minister normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the bay james responds to a dynamic of workforce particular and hydro - quebec responds specifically to it for the years 1970."
The great head of the project eastmain, réal laporte, société d "énergie of the baie james (sebj), has given an explanation which has highlighted the fact that the contract of management of the project has been concedido direct.
"If respondes a tendering and there are few participants, your prices are going to be more elevados."
"Tienes two options: puedes come in contact with the players in the sector and decirles: we are going to negotiate an agreement satisfactorio and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," mr laporte pointed out.
The consortium contract concedido the énergie gérance form part of a long list of contracts of more than 50 000 dollars obtained by the quebequense party.
The contracts were concedidos by hydro - quebec or the sebj for the eastmain project - 1 - to - sarcelle - rupert.
After the comprobación, i devoir has identified 109 asesoramiento technical concedidos contracts between the year 2002 and march 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratorios geotécnicos.
Snc - lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, génivar managed 16, tecsult 14 and dessau 10, without taking account of its participation in énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negociados.
In total, amounting to usd 449.783.344, including the contract of énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain simard has given to understand that the four companies that are the consortium (bpr, dessau, groupe sm and axor) are "good known of the liberal party of quebec."
The minister normandeau has made that the pq is also vinculado to these companies, which is "financian," before precisar that it is more of their leaders.
Barómetro of consumption the etiqueta "verde" no inspira confidence responsible.
More ecológico, but deeply escéptico.
The consumidor quebequense hardly confidence in the players of sustainable development, as well as in the marcas of fair trade or in the certificados ecológicos to guiar their elections.
According to the barómetro responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. the consumidor is sumergido in a universe mediático by where pululan messages that defienden a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of information fiable and considers that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if has increased the consumption of products so - called "socialmente responsible" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to very little credit to those who seek venderlos.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that does not confían in the environmental commitment of the companies or in the advertising ecologistas of the same, revela the tool of measuring elaborada by the observatorio of responsible consumption the university of sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers in doubt the fiabilidad official certificados that portan the so - called justos products, as well as the credibility of the products and marcas etiquetas indicando that are "ecorresponsables," señala the barómetro.
The same way, as only a 14,6% of the quebequenses take seriously the speeches of the political on this issue.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently sustentado by close to a third of the consumers quebequenses.
In fact, the gaps and the dudoso nature of the information that a 46% of consumers desechen this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the barómetro, after the more high price of these products.
In addition, a third of the quebequenses say desconfiar also of the supuestos rendimientos of products or services ecológicos that they are trying to sell.
Furthermore, practically half of the consumers changed their hábitos in 2010 and, especially, changed the marks of one or several products for respetar their convicciones.
61% has given priority to the purchases in its neighbourhood shops and has preferido buy products alimentarios cultivados in their region, señala the barómetro.
More verde and responsible (rate of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), the homo consumus of quebec adora occupy the position of the rey of reciclaje which seeks to reduce their impact on the environment preocupándose for the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the barómetro, that social conscience appears to be of doors (its) afuera: car in 2010, as only 28% of the quebequenses indicated that has used the public transport or have shared car for defender their principles ecologistas.
In addition, the 39,1% of the participants of this broad survey of behaviour, which has just completar its first edition, supports the use of the bicicleta and ordinary desplazamientos.
A loan for the state regains excentris
The government of quebec, who have asked comprometa financially in the recuperación the complex of cinemas excentris pos the société angus and the parallèle, acepta cooperate, but only through a loan.
The société of développement angus and the parallèle, that esperaban a donation of seven million dollars from the ministry of culture to return to buy daniel langlois the complex cinematográfico excentris in the bulevar saint - laurent and devolverle its true cinéfila vocation, have not obtained what pedían.
The government has accepted implicarse in the matter, but on their propias conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the government of quebec proposes a loan whose cuantía would be, in fact less than the expectations iniciales; this could constituir a viable solution in ventajosas conditions, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec last spring had already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12,8 million, but since then the solicitudes have been revisado downwards.
The president of the société développement des entreprises culturelles (sodec), françois macerola, that lidera the expediente excentris, remitió a proposal and a plan of action to the minister st - pierre.
Has remitido a final report a decena days ago.
However, the sodec received a contrapropuesta cabinet on tuesday.
The parallèle and angus have term until 31 december to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that must desecharse completely the idea of a donation of the state.
Remember that the association of owners of cinema and complex cinematográficos rooms of quebec oponía to a state "s direct investment for respaldar recuperación excentris, arguing that the ministry of culture must not fund building projects, since it has not done with other rooms of cinema.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector itself reclaman an economic aid considerable.
Daniel langlois, the owner of the same, has carried over ten years the burden of the author in their local cinemas the complex, after finance its own construction, which could justify a derogación on the part of the council of the treasury.
The lack of independent rooms for películas is patente in montreal and excentris had sabido fidelizar to its clientela.
The company angus and the parallèle, dirigidas by christian yaccarini, impulsan for its part a campaign of funding in private, waiting together 700.000 dollars for abrirse path towards the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these, the parallèle rooms, continues proyectando películas in excentris.
The aim of the future compradores is reabrir three rooms next 27 february, proyectando preciosa film of xavier beauvois "des hommes et des dieux."

Is levanta the velo of canada acomplejado...
The new cables diplomáticos americans divulgados by wikileaks desvelan what the united states consider as a complex of the canadian with regard to the americans, but reflejan at the same time the feeling of superioridad of these last towards canada.
That the canadian diplomáticos americans surprised that the electorate not piensen in relations canada - united states when they are going to vote and believe that the visit of president obama has helped the conservative government to achieve aprobase its budget in 2009!
The four new comunicaciones between the american embassy of ottawa and washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather jugosos details that content really sustancial.
A cable of 22 september 2008, is to say, for full federal election campaign, relata to what extent the united states do not fall in the issues debatidas by political leaders.
This caused great surprise the american envoy ambassador to ottawa, david wilkins.
Mr wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders will see condicionados by an inferiority complex practically inherent to the canadian the time to address the issues domésticas diarias, instead of leaving such choice to the united states (as during the campaign on the free trade in 1988) ," writes.
Therefore, concludes, the united states are "the elefante proverbial this choice: omnipresente, but potentially too peligroso to talk about it."
The ambassador has even more problems in understand this "silence ensordecedor" because the two countries mantienen intensas relations and economic policies.
"Lógicamente view, the capacity of a candidate, of a party, and even more, the head of a party to manage these essential should be a key factor in the relations which should think voters at the time of the vote."
We can see this feeling of importance also the cable sent the 22 january 2009 by terry breese, responsible business in ottawa, to prepare the president barack obama to his first visit to ottawa.
"Its journey contribuirá to ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of february on the federal budget, by which canada registrará deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a plan of recuperación between 30.000 and 40.000 millions of dollars," writes mr breese.
In any hand is mención that the government had to prorrogar parliament before navidad in order to prevent sustituyese the coalition or that the parties of the opposition condicionaban its survival in the quality of the recuperación proposed plan.
Another communication of january 2008 signed by the ambassador wilkins alerta to washington on the increasingly negative image that transmiten the series dramáticas difundidas in the cbc of united states.
It concerned the emission of the ambassador border, little mosque on the prairie, intelligence and h2o, in the references are made little sutiles to maher arar, to the "no - fly - list" or even the secuestros to the cia realice enérgicos interrogatorios.
Another cable mind that, during its first meeting bilateral, hillary clinton preguntó to its homólogo french bernard kouchner if europe would be prepared to acoger some prisoners of guantánamo.
Mr kouchner replied that yes, but dependía "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has submitted a document to the secretary of state in connection with omar khadr, a muslim of 15 years of canadian origin."
"Secretary accepted review the expediente."
Finally, we can mencionar that have been calentado the ánimos in relation to the site wikileaks.
Tom flanagan, former consejero very close to stephen harper, stated in the radio cbc that responsible for this fuga masiva should be "murdered."
In the united states are echo of mike huckabee.
A global plan to renew the iluminación
Yesterday, the un has proposed in cancún a renewal of the iluminación plan doméstica industrial, commercial and in a hundred countries to reduce the gases effect invernadero (gei) in an amount that is almost a third of the reduction adicional that must llevarse out to stabilise the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambicioso plan falls in the whole of large projects particular that the un expects to be adopte in cancún to compensar the lack of compromisos binding reduction in the countries industrializados.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the bombillas incandescentes, which still monopolising between 50 and 70% of the market, sustituyesen by bombillas fluocompactas or, even better, for bombillas diodos electroluminescentes (or "led" in english), prevent large part of the 1.800 million tonnes (gt) of gei emitidas in the planet to iluminar human.
The iluminación is responsible for 8% of the emisiones world.
Is the equivalente 70% of the emisiones park automovilístico planetario.
In copenhague, last year, the large countries issuers, as the united states, china, europe and others, including canada, comprometieron with a reduction voluntarias plans to disminuir the emisiones globales of gei 53 gt to 49 gt.
However, should disminuirse still 5 gt this amount to stabilise, before 2020, the increase in the temperaturas in two degrees centígrados in order to prevent descontrole.
In the bombillas incandescentes, 95% of energy disipa in the form of heat and the rest, is to say, a 5%, produces light.
In the case of the bombillas fluocompactas, the gasto in energy is reduce of 75% and with the new bombillas led, it is a reduce still two times more energy consumption.
The bombillas fluocompactas duran an average of between 6.000 and 10.000 a. m.
The new bombillas led, as that has launched the fabricante philips this week (a company which, moreover, has participated in the study of the un), have a hope of life of 25.000 hours and consumen 80% less energy than a bombilla incandescente, what we are to have an idea of savings that can be achieved with the substitution plan that is aplicaría in 100 countries.
These new bombillas can also function with reóstatos and emiten very little heat.
Above, contain nothing of mercurio.
Various specialists have expressed their reservations in relation to the bombillas fluocompactas, because that contain mercurio and that must eliminarse as residuos peligrosos, which is not always possible in the countries in development, except that manufacturers affix instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of emissions of mercurio in the planet are not the bombillas fluocompactas, but the carbón térmicas plants, which emiten a great deal of mercurio to produce electricity derrocha with the bombillas incandescentes.
Only in the united states, these central emiten 25.000 tonnes of mercurio per year.
The report detalla the advantages that international ofrecería this programme to each country.
For example, indonesia save in this way one thousand million dollars a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of co2, that is to say, the equivalente to 3.5 central térmicas whose construction costaría 2.5 million.
Costa marfil expected ansiosamente the announcement of the electoral results
The secretary - general of the un, ban ki - moon, has solicitado publication "inmediata" of the results of the presidential elections in marfil coast, given that have expirado the deadlines set.
"The secretary - general highlights the need for the independent electoral commission complete its work and anuncie the results provisionales immediately," resalta a spokesman of the head of the un.

However, the bando of gbagbo account with the annulment by the council constitucional of the votes "fraudulentos" in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion forces of the new (fn) since the coup of state failed september 2002.
Pascal affi n "guessan, director of the president of the expense of marfil campaign, has afirmado that the manoeuvres of intimidación of the voters realizadas by the fn in the north of the country had disuadido the supporters of the president saliente to go to vote.
The whole election could be anulada if the council constitucional acepta the complaints presentadas by gbagbo.
Now, the adversarios of gbagbo consider that the most high court for the country is not neutro, because that is directed by paul yao n "dré, a close aliado political gbagbo.
Alassane ouattara, a man of the north that lie any connection with the old rebeldes, has tried to "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked gbagbo that respect, but has not gone as far as to reivindicar victory.
Their allies afirman that gbagbo bloquea the publication of the results because knows that has lost and to present a queja before the council constitucional having prevented that the commission the dissemination of the election results, it would be ilegal.
The second round of the presidential, on sunday, should have put the guinda the process of reunificación and reconciliación of a country divided in two years ago.

Subject clotilde reiss: the eliseo has exaggerated the mediation of syria
For more than ten months, between july 2009 and may 2010, the fate of clotilde reiss, the young french investigadora arrested in iran for "espionaje," has had in vilo the public in france, has alertado to diplomacy and has acentuado the deterioration of relations between paris and teherán.
All under the atenta sights of the diplomáticos united states.
The american documents obtained by wikileaks and consultados by monde unknown revelan certain aspects of this crisis.
Describen how the eliseo has explained its strategy to the americans to the point of darles councils to manage their propias "hostages" crisis in iran (a small group of senderistas).
Show how the french responsible tried to convince washington that the release of the young french not occurred in exchange for the release of majid kakavand, a iraní arrested in france and buscado by the american justice for tráficos of material for the programme nuclear iraní.
Finally, revelan the cruda reality of how the french presidency tried manipular to the media to the idea that the president sirio, bachar al - assad, had desempeñado an essential role in the release of clotilde reiss.
In reality, did nothing.
A telegrama diplomático redactado on 12 august 2009 in paris the title "iran: french comments on the way of managing the cases of hostages."
The consejero of the eliseo for estratégicos affairs, françois richier, acompañado of director of the quai d "orsay for the north of áfrica and oriente means, patrice paoli, conversan with the american diplomática kathleen allegrone.
I explain the french method.
Aconsejan the americans to do so next to repatriar to their own citizens retenidos to force in iran.
"Haced noise," say, "soltad continually" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "inocencia," "liberation inmediata."
All for avergonzar the regime iraní, cuidadoso of its image.
"When the iraníes you pidan that paréis, hacedlo more frecuentemente yet."
Because, once agotados the intentos of negotiation for discretos channels, "the silence solucionará nothing," the iraníes are "experts in dilatorias manoeuvres."
Mr richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a tactic iraní usual: the taking of hostages to the political chantaje."
Announced that the release of prison of clotilde reiss (producirá the 16 august, day in refugiará in the embassy of france) "requerirá the payment to the iraníes of a great amount of money" (230.000 recompensa).
In addition, señala that the eliseo anticipa other hostages, a phenomenon that crisis "is going to increase."
The iraníes could "in a future next stop to another of the close of 1.800 french citizens living in iran, says.
28 august 2009.
Clotilde reiss out of prison after 12 days, but is bloqueada in iran.
Spreads the following information: the iraní majid kakavand, whose extradición applying the united states by traffic ilícito of electronic material delicado towards iran, has been put in freedom in paris by decision of a judge.
The american embassy, like many observers, dudan of this extraña coincidencia.
To washington, which closely networks clandestinas iraníes acquisition of material for the nuclear programme, the excarcelación majid khakavand is a bad news.
Does france has accepted a exchange?
Will release the iraní change of the french?
During a new conversation with kathleen allegrone, on 4 september, françois richier guarantees that was not the case.
The eliseo, says, not only "has been surprised by the decision of the enormemente judge," but which has tried to oppose the same.
"Has habido negotiations intensas between the french presidency and the minister of justice" (in the time, michèle alliot - marie), but "the french government cannot overturn the judicial decision," comenta.
Mr richier also wants to show majid kakavand continues under the french "close" monitoring of the information services.
The consejero of the eliseo marks a number of telephone reports, cuelga and, after, the diplomática us that the iraní "is currently in a few buildings paris gestionados by the embassy iraní."
During the arrest of clotilde reiss in iran, the eliseo not escatima efforts, used comunicados and "fugas" organizadas in the media to believe that the president sirio bachar al - assad plays an important role "" and "influential" of "mediator."
The americans observan this activity with a certain irony and comprueban that the manipulation brings its frutos, since several articles of the press transmiten french the official version.
A telegrama with date of 25 august 2009 mentions "the" blitz "mediático of the french officials."
What must be such "gratitud" towards mr assad, question the embassy in paris.
"Despite their statements llenas alabanzas, the french officials recognise in private that so only have a vaga idea of what really have done the syrians."
Then, the document is the reasons that have led the eliseo give rise to this fiction.
The great effort of communication "is subject validar the sarkozy policy of openness towards syria," opinion.
A policy iniciada in 2008, that "in view of many voices criticism in france and abroad, acababa be tachada of prematura and desmerecida."
The paris "exaggerate the role sirio," seeks "show to syria elogios that can cosechar if plays a constructive role in the region."
The objective also consists in "sembrar the semilla of the discordia between syria and iran."
The american embassy knows of good source.
The 11 august, françois richier i hopes: "of course, do not know if the syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we have grateful."
"At least, this should cause confusion between the iraníes."
Clotilde reiss regresa france the 16 may 2010.
Nicolas sarkozy receives in the eliseo.
In a communiqué, thanks to the presidents of brazil, senegal and sirio that have desempeñado a "active role in favour of the release of our compatriota."
After midnight, young people coreanos cannot play in line
The government surcoreano going to adopt a law so - called "of cenicienta" that impedirá adolescents to participate in games line after the average evening blocking access, according to have indicado responsible gubernamentales.
In december someterá a draft law to parliament to ask to businesses of games in line bloqueen access to dichos after midnight games to young people of less than 16 years, according to have indicado representatives of the ministerios culture and of family.
"Many children juegan all night and, later, it is difficult for them to study in the school and carry a normal life during the day."
"Pensamos that this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to dream," the afp declared jo rin, responsible ministerial responsible for the draft law.
The games in line estarán new available to the six of the morning.
Businesses dispondrán a year in order to prepare for the implementation of the law, needs.
The government is plantea also ask to businesses that limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people as well soliciten, added the responsible.
Furthermore, will make available to those who solicite computer programmes gratuitos to limit the time of connection to the internet.
Corea south is one of the countries most "conectados" and newspapers are news regularly on various facts linked to a intensivo of internet use.
The country is also the campeón undisputed of the world competiciones games in line.
In november, corea south won four medallas of gold in the world cyber games, where other 58 countries are faced.
2018 world - 2022: the fifa referred to the countries organizadores
In the middle of the storm caused by the sospechas corruption, the executive committee of the fifa designates the thursday to the countries organizadores of copas of the world of 2018 and 2022, a political choice clearly where the struggles of influence and the lobbying can reach primar on the criteria técnicos.
One thing is clear, 2018 edition of the competition of the fifa will take place in europe, bastión traditional the disciplina (four candidates: inglaterra, russia, spain, portugal and netherlands, belgium).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exótica, given that the international federation expects conquistar new territories (qatar, australia), after the continent africano a premiere in 2010, or continue with their implementation in the united states or in the lejano oriente (japan, south corea).
The list of the personalidades which formed part of the delegaciones (david cameron, prince william, josé luis rodríguez zapatero, josé socrates, bill clinton, the emir qatar, the heads of government belgian and dutch, zidane, beckham, cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a world.
The transactions between the scenes, therefore, it is possible that duren until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a jerarquía between the candidates.
According to the report for the assessment of the fifa, candidates english, hispano - american portuguesa (2018) and (2022) have better arguments that their competidores.
However, these consideraciones will not have too much weight to the 22 members of the executive board of vote at the time.
The sunday times, responsible for the revelaciones that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the ce (reynald temarii and amos adamu), could have arruinado well the opportunities of your country, cuna world of football, which only acogió the once, in 1966.
The bbc added leña to hoguera on monday difundir a documental that has been in evidence to three influyentes members of the ce, ricardo teixeira, nicolas leoz and issa hayatou.
Enough to disgustar to the fifa and avergonzar the responsible english, which have been launched to a lobbying intensive in recent weeks with david cameron the head.
The head of government hopes reeditar the coup given successfully by his predecesor, tony blair, that was achieved in 2005 for london the organisation of the jj. oo, 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to restore the brillo of inglaterra before the ce?
It is not clear, since the duo spain - portugal also has many strong points thanks to their world stadiums, already ready, their experience (of 82 in spain, jj. oo in barcelona 1992, copa of europe in 2004 in portugal) and its culture futbolística.
However, the economic and financial bleak prospects of both countries could echar down its ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the british and the doubts about the solvencia of spain and portugal only who manage is to points to russia, convertida in a outsider weight in spite of the gaps in their candidature (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the prime minister vladimir putin decided not to move to zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a direct reference to the accusations of the english language press against the member states of the ce.
"Are sacando to relucir their trapos sucios, trying comprometerles," he said putin.
For 2022, the united states, which have the experience of 1994, seem to favoritos more lógicos.
First potencia global economic and seat of the main patrocinadores the fifa, the country appears to llevarle advantage to japan and corea south, which have developed by separado one excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem to prematuras for two countries that have organised together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the world 2026 to china, fervientemente deseada by the fifa, lead to asia quedara without possibilities for 2022.
Alongside qatar, which has presented its project basis in stadiums futuristas, and australia, the fifa proseguiría with its expansion towards new horizontes, but both countries have more risks than certezas.
Australia, like japan and corea, also could verse perjudicada by the weakness of the rights of tv paid (in role of the difference horaria) by the european countries, the espina backbone of the war for the fifa.
Second mandate: the evidence
Of gaulle really had dudado.
Mitterrand had given to understand that dudaba.
Valéry giscard d "estaing and jacques chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And nicolas sarkozy less still.
A mandate in the eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state volverá be candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this not well with the combined misterio that asociarse often the presidential role.
Therefore, should be aparentar always that doubt.
Towards a hand and the other.
In 2006, although not creyesen, the friends of jacques chirac afirmaban that not descartaba a third mandate.
The 15 november, in tone, nicolas sarkozy indicaba that tomaría seriously its decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that dealing with the members of the ump, on tuesday night in the eliseo, the possibility of "two mandatos" has provocado true revuelo.
What this is the official announcement of its candidacy?
Far less.
The president so only indicaba that the reform constitucional 2008 limitaba two the number of mandatos five years.
Simply transmitía the facts, not a announcement.
It is not the first time, with a tone which speaks of the presidential jocoso, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better still, of the cases, pasaréis seven years and a half conmigo," had soltado in july 2009.
On another occasion, in may 2010: "do not penséis that i am not planteo what vendrá after."
Their afirmaciones of anteayer to bring more to the candidacy, nor less.
Raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidature in the ps, on the one hand.
But is not the fact that ségolène royal has subido to the palestra what leads to nicolas sarkozy sincerarse.
Quite the contrary; the fact that your candidature in 2012 resulte clear is that leads to many people of the ps reclamar that they organice the batalla before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, the voters of right prefieren the candidature of françois fillon to nicolas sarkozy (the 46% against the 44%, according to bva - l "express).
"We have a candidate and in the ump there is no discussion on the subject," has reaccionado inmediata and prudentemente the environment of the prime minister.
"If thinks that can lose, will not be candidate," jean - pierre raffarin view.
"Always pensará that can win," corrige alain juppé, resignado before the evidence.
Euro: the bce is obliged to maintain its adquisiciones letters of the state
The last meeting of the council of governors of the european central bank (bce) of the year should allow precisar modalidades exit the crisis, or at least, anunciar the interrupción a large number of operations of conventional monetary policy that should not finalizar at the end of the year.
As a result of the crisis of the debt soberana, the european institute of emission frankfurt certainly cannot permitirse be so perentorio if it wants to agravar a situation arriesgarse more than complicada today in the european markets of obligations.
The political cost would be as high.
Yesterday, during a rueda of the press, the french minister of finance, christine lagarde, has supported the active role desempeñado by the bce in favour of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the european states.
Has not wanted to say if considered that the central bank should do more, for example increasing its programme of purchase of state obligations.
"I reservo my opinion for my fellow europeans...."
On the eve, in bruselas, during his hearing before the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament, the president of the bce, jean - claude trichet, there was no more elocuente in terms of their intenciones, indicando only that the programme of purchase of letters of the state in the market secundario "continuaba" and that "already veremos what decidimos" during the meeting of thursday.
The only that it is clear is that the bce will maintain its main type invariable in the 1%, the more low level of its history since may 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of the treasury by part of the bce has been duplicado last week to reach around eur 1.350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscretos operators of the market, would have bought irlandeses titles and portuguese again yesterday.
In total, central banks of the eurosistema have acquired qualifications for a cuantía of 67.000 millions of euros from may 2010.
Between the operators of the market, not doubt the most minimum that seguirán purchases (consulte page 29).
The economists nor prevén any significant changes of direction.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months already have disappeared arsenal the bce, this still makes asignaciones ilimitadas of liquidity to beneficiosas conditions and with duraciones that varían between a week and three months.
The economists expect that today prolongue this device for some months.
"I do not imagine that will modificar considerably its programme."
"If not, run the risk of causing new tensiones short - term" economist of commerzbank, michael schubert view.
"Seems more likely to be produzca a way out progresiva announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipa by your side norbert bräms, economist in salt.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the speeches on the market of the public debt, "the bce should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to the market is stable mantenga," adds norbert bräms.
Bearing in mind the importance of the exposiciones of european banks to the markets of soberanas debts in the area of the euro, the institute of emission does not has more option to maintain their presence in the market.
"Must compensar any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way that impida a subida marked the rendimientos abonados yesterday by the member states more frágiles," opinaba an important gestor of obligations.
Because, if the rates of interest is put by the clouds, the states will have even more problems in order to reduce their debt, or even for estabilizarlo.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In italy, the government of berlusconi capea the temporary
After that italy has started the week of a disturbing, the situation mejoró slightly yesterday with the reflujo the types of the obligations to 10 years.

Nieve and ice: 24 departments in alerta orange
The nevadas still provocando difficulties of movement, especially in the network secundaria in britain, and can afectar diversas economic activities.
Currently, veinticuatro departments are in alerta orange due to the risk of nevadas and training of ice.
Eure, eure - et - loir, deux - sèvres and vienne have been sumado to twenty departments which were already in alerta orange, dieciocho from wednesday to the day and two, dordogne and gironde, the group unieron for the evening.
According to météo france, the strong nevadas falls afectan north of gironde and charentes, but also nieva slightly in island of france.
We expect a layers of nieve between 2 and 5 cm, puntualmente of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even until 5 cm, in the region parisina.
The departments concerned are charente, charente - maritime, côtes d "armor, finistère, gironde, dordogne poitou and those of the regions of low normandía, island of france and lemosín.
The nevadas are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of movement and afectar some economic activities, alerta météo france.
In the côtes d "armor, has been banned the access to several roads departamentales vehicles pesados of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the ejes guingamp - lannion and saint - brieuc - loudéac.

Financial metre of grand paris: first borradores
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the island of france has reached its álgido point, llueven thousands of millions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, hablamos of the 23.000 million for the metre of the grand paris must build the société du grand paris.
To start this sgp, the state has announced a asignación funds of 4.000 millions of euros.
In the teórico level, this sum will be the permitirá subsequently to the sgp obtain loans in the markets to fund a part of its dual bucle.
Today, finally, we have the first auditors.
The law of rectificativa of 2010, examinada finances in the committee on national finances of the house this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipamiento and the increase in tax on the offices in the island of france.
The first, according to leemos in article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution société du grand paris."
Moreover, is fijada in numbers: "the product of this tax is 117 millions of euros a year."
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "for modernizarlo, increase their product and destinar said increase to the société du grand paris."
So how much obtendría with this method?
Who knows.
In the text does not give figures.
But is far from 4.000 million.
"Is precisely that the resources fiscales is añaden to the 4.000 millions of euros of the asignación of funds that movilizará the state and to be concederán to the société du grand paris measure to move the project," we can read in the explanatory statement of reasons.
It is not to the sgp surprised this system.
"From the moment that create income (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cubrir studies for three years and after receiving the 4.000 million later, according to explicamos."
"Registrará in the budget and utilizará role of the needs."
The sgp estimated that empecerá to receive the 4.000 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which the 4.000 million prometidos not figuran in the credit, can lead to a parliamentary debate slightly encendido.
The first public sitting will be the 7 december.
Hackers vengadores and espías diligentes
The issue wikileaks has a dual value.
On the one hand, desvela a scandal aparente, a scandal that such only seems scandal before the hipocresía that rige relations between states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, announced profound changes at international level and provides for a future dominated by the regresión.
But let us step by step.
The first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expediente created by a secret service (regardless of the nation in the pertenezca) is formado exclusively by recortes of the press.
The "extraordinary" sexual revelaciones americans on the customs of berlusconi so only reflejan what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those who belong to berlusconi) and the profile siniestramente ridiculizador of khadafi leads a long time dando ideas the artists of cabaret to create their sketches.
The rule according to the secret dossiers as only must be formados by news of conocimiento public is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If visit a librería dedicada publications esotéricas, verá that each repite (on the grial labour, the misterio rennes - i - château, the templarios or the rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This must be not only to the authors of texts ocultistas do not want to do research inéditas (or do not know where seek developments on the inexistente), but because those who are engaged in ocultismo so not only confían in what i already know, that reconfirma what had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of give brown.
The same aplica to secret files.
The informador is perezoso, as is perezoso (or has little ansia) the head of the secret services (if i could not be what i know, editor of the libération), that only considers true what can recognise.
The information top secret on berlusconi that enviaba the american embassy of rome the department of state was the same publicaba the previous newsweek the week.
Then, why have caused such revuelo the revelaciones of these dossiers?
On the one hand, as only say that any person cultivada already know, is to say that the embajadas, at least since the second world war and since the heads of states can llamarse by telephone or take the plane to meet cenar, have lost their role diplomática and, to the exception of some ejercicios limitados representación, have been transformed in centres of espionaje.
Any espectador that vea películas of research is perfectly aware, only aparentamos, so that we do not know for hipocresía.
In any case, the fact repetirlo publicly infringe the duty of hipocresía and gives a bad image of the american diplomacy.
In second place, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the world "s secret more secrets to the country more poderoso affects considerably to the prestigio department of state.
Therefore, the scandal affects both to the victims and to the "verdugos."
But entremos in the real nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at the time of orwell, could concebirse all power as a big brother that controlaba every gesture of their súbditos.
The profecía orwell has been made since reality, be able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every compromise made, hotel visitado, motorway taken, the citizen convertía in this way in a comprehensive victim of the eye of the power.
But when it demuestra, as happens now, that even the criptas power cannot escape the control of the secret of a hacker, the relationship of control ceases to be unidireccional and are becoming circular.
The controls to every citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, elegido as the vengeful secret) can know all the citizens of the power.
How can aguantarse a power that it no longer can retain their own secret?
It is true, as georg simmel, said that a real secret is a secret vacío (and a secret vacío can never be unveiled); it is also true that all conocimiento on the nature of berlusconi or merkel is in reality a secret vacío, without secret, since procede the public; but desvelar area, as has done wikileaks, that the secret of hillary clinton were secret vacíos means quitarle all power.
Wikileaks has not made any damage to sarkozy or merkel, but yes, and very much, clinton and obama.
What will be the consequences of this herida causada a potencia so poderosa?
It is clear that, in the future, the states no longer be able to put in the network any information reservada, because that would be as publicarla on a poster in full street.
But it is also evident that, with the current technologies, we cannot expect maintain talks confidenciales by telephone.
Nothing is more easy to find out if and when a head of state has been desplazado aeroplane and it has been in contact with one of the homólogos.
How can maintain in the future relations private and confidenciales?
I know perfectly well that, at the moment, my foresight is something of science fiction and, therefore, novelesca, but i imagine to actors gubernamentales desplazan discreet in proceedings with itinerarios incontrolables, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, escondiendo some data escritos on the heels of their shoes.
This information is conserva then, in a single copia, in cajones closed with llave: in order to auditors, the attempt espionaje of watergate took less success that wikileaks.
In the past, i have written that the technology currently avanza as a cangrejo, namely backwards.
A century after the telégrafo without cables has revolucionado comunicaciones, the internet has returned to create a telégrafo with cables (telefónicos).
The cintas of video (analógicas) had enabled the researchers cinema to study a film step by step, avanzando and retrocediendo, discovering all the secret of the assembly, whereas now the cds (digitales) only allow progress or back of chapter in chapter, that is to say, to proporciones enormous.
With the high - speed trains, we can go hand in rome to milan in three hours, while in aircraft, with the desplazamientos that conlleva, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, nothing is outside the normal that the policy and the communication we lleven of new technologies to the coches caballos.
A last comentario.
Formerly, the press intentaba understand what is tramaba secret in the embajadas.
At present, are the embajadas which call for information confidencial to the press.
Climate: the chapuzas in france in its promises of funding
A year after the copenhague agreement, it is time to examine whether the promises of funding have been respetado rapidly desbloqueadas (so - called fast start or precoces) realizadas by the developed countries.
And have been revealed the chapuzas francesas.
In the copenhague agreement, the developed countries comprometieron to provide 30.000 millions of dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The european union comprometió to aportar 7.200 millions of euros in three years and france 1.260 millions of euros (that is to say, 420 million per year).
During the opening of the cop16, the eu has put on the table their best letters to convince its partners that compromise with the financiaciones fast start is real: a report detallando measures of its member states, a rueda of the press, a great event complementario, the distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency result apreciable and was apreciada by what really applies: the countries in development and the society civil would that all the developed countries hiciesen the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The eu has announced that released 2010 2.200 millions of euros, which the sitúa in the right path towards the fulfilment of its commitment to 7.200 million in 2012.
But, if the situation detalladamente estudiamos, things are more complicadas.
According to the copenhague agreement, the money must be "new and adicional" to ensure that an effort is realice complementario, without prejudice to the official aid to development.
Unfortunately, has not been reached an agreement on what is meant by "new and adicional."
When the european commission proposed a armonización, some member states, including france, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each which escoge the reference that more conviene.
For example, the european commission has taken as a reference year 2009: it maintains the international funding and añaden 150 million in three years concept of funding fast start.
Other countries have elegido references similares in what respecta the year or the level of official aid to development.
On the contrary, france believes that the financing of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and adicionales."
In other words, it cannot be a reference to the total expenditure of the previous years or the level of official aid to development.
In particular, the total cuantía of the aid of france to the countries in development can remain stable (or even disminuir), while seeks to respeta its commitment in the field of funds "new and adicionales..."
Another crucial element, the distribution between donaciones and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and which escoge the method of calculation.
Some, such as france, equivale consider that each euro paid to a euro donado.
Of course, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for determinadas investments that are rentables (frecuentemente, projects relating to the reduction of emisiones based in technologies more effective), it is falaz present a euro that is going to recover as equivalente to a euro which is dona... as much, only should computar for their compromisos the cost of the loan for the country which gives the loan (that is to say, the equivalente at a rate of interest).
But france is not useful such reasoning: "respeta" your commitment to 420 million euros doing a 91,5% of loans (eur 389,8 million) and 8,5% of donaciones (36,1 millions of euros); consulte the document of the eu to see it for their own eyes.
This is the only country of the union that uses so frecuentemente the loan.
Germany used in a 46%, while dinamarca, the netherlands or eslovaquia, among others, respetan its compromisos with a 100% of donaciones.
In other words, when the majority of the european union aporta a euro to fulfil its commitment, france so only ten cents and considers that the effort is aporta comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its funding fast start, france makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in the time and, on the other, in connection with the real financial effort.
Gastando so only 36,1 millions of euros, manages to give the impression that spends 420 million "new and adicionales," as had prometido.
The manipulation of the ministry of finance (because it seems that it is bercy who has been occupied the arbitraje) could have a double negative impact, both within the eu (why were the other member states to continue donando when can simply prestar?) as in the negotiations, since the countries in development are not tontos...
The chapter of the funding precoz is peanuts, relatively short - term, in connection with the whole of the negotiations on the climate.
But could be a grano arena of more in the vast maquinaria that is the cmnucc.
Esperemos that is not the case.
Is what fuere, it is indispensable learn this first year of financiaciones precoces.
Firstly, france could anunciar a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respetar their compromisos and the same way that the restantes countries of the european union.
But, especially, france could do that avanzasen debates on gambling stake in relation to the long - term funding (another chapter essential is debatiendo currently): we do not libraremos of the issue of the "nature adicional" or the method for computar loans.
France could change its position to volverse as progresista in connection with this issue as it is with other.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new environment minister, madam kosciusko - morizet, which will cancún next week.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of france and on its vision of the "adicional" and the use of the loans contribuiría to improve the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the negotiations.
On the pesticidas warning ingeridos by children
A child of 10 years ingiere in a different day 81 substances químicas, according to indicates a study published on wednesday the partnership générations futures (the former movement for rights and the respect of the generaciones futuras).
The partnership, which warns that its results "do not have a significant value estadístico bearing in mind the limited number of muestras analysed, but are illustrative of the problem tratada," adquirió in supermercados of oise and paris between july and september the food which often consume a child of ten years in four and a tentempié meals per day.
These meals taken as a model, which respetan official recommendations (five parts of fruit and verduras frescas, three of dairy products and 1,5 litres of water per day), as well as the golosinas, were examinadas in the laboratorios in search of substances químicas, pesticidas, metales pesados and other contaminantes.
The balance of plato is abrumador: 81 substances químicas, of which 42 clasificadas as carcinogenic possible or probables and five substances clasificadas as carcinogenic seguros, as well as 37 substances susceptibles to act as perturbadores endocrinos (pe), according to the studies of diversas international institutions such as the centre of research on cancer.
"Although, in practically the whole of the cases, does not exceed the legal limits for each of the substances químicas individual, our study shows clearly that the exposure of consumers to contaminantes possibly carcinogenic and / or pe is preocupante," señala the partnership.
For the breakfast, the mantequilla and tea with milk containing itself alone more than a decena residuos carcinogenic possible and three regarded as carcinogenic seguros, as well as close to a veintena residuos which can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, importada of brazil, as tentempié planned for the college, contains trazas six substances químicas, including a fungicida banned in france.
The same aplica to the judías greens of kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detectado trazas a powerful insecticida banned in the eu.
In addition, the russian steak, the atún in lata and even the barra of bread or the chicle were aderezados with pesticidas and other substances químicas.
In the water of the grifo, discovered the presence of nitratos analysis and cloroformo.
In the dinner, the rodaja salmón was the more "nutritiva" with 34 residuos chemical detected and even the analysis of the plato of plastic used for calentar food in the microondas not was completely clean.
The risk end that generan these "cócteles of contaminantes" for the consumidor "probably underestimates," says the study.
The europe - lv ecology - i verts (usa alliance), for its part, has proposed "in front of the seriousness of the situation" apply a moratoria on the use of pesticidas to curb "the increase in the asociadas diseases to the civilización."
In july, a study of the european agency for food security (aesa) indicaba the presence of residuos of 365 pesticidas different identificados in the fruit and verdura consumidas in europe, of which 76 in the cereales.
