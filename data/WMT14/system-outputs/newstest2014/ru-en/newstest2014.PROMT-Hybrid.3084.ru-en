Germany, the first in Europe is entering "uncertain sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe, where it will be allowed at the registration of children born hermaphrodites instead of male or female indicate "uncertain".
At the child's parents the right for time will leave the column "floor" in the birth certificate blank.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can record "X" (uncertain) for a time.
This decision is aimed at to push parents to rush to operation to "schedule" sex.
Statistically, one of 2,000 newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Anger because of the sentence to the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 dead as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, angrily responded to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators who appeared in court and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Began to flow which spent nearly 10 years which are in hiding as one of the most searched people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for its role in creation of the explosive devices used during act of terrorism yesterday.
It can be released within 15 years if receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist region of Kut, during which 202 were lost, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were wounded.
He was also found guilty on several other charges, including a wave of explosions of churches linked to terrorism across Indonesia on Christmas eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence while they could insist that the person nicknamed "demolition man" for the reputation of the master in the production of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision compounded painful memories of the mother from Perth with the June Cortina who lost the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny from the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.
Barely concealing tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that it should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before rasstrelny command — ms. Cortina AARP said.
— I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandchildren anymore and I will not see my daughters ".
The Sari club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in the van parked outside right after the 11th evening was put on 12 October 2002 in action.
Peter Hughes was in a bar "Paddy" where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives, only 20 seconds earlier.
After that act of terrorism it for a month fallen into a coma and "died" three times, connecting to a life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of a terrorist cell "Jemaah Islamiyah" responsible for a bloodbath — Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
To save it from life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounded hundreds — it not so much.
Began to flow is the last of the parties to act of terrorism in Bali appearing before the court.
He disappeared for almost 10 years, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed a former leader of "al Qaeda" Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence witnessing: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reassociate the terrorist groups in south-east Asia and "al Qaeda".
"He did not give up" — ms. Cortina said.
Until recently he did not regret for that at all, how many he grieved other people.
The sentence is imposed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the act of terrorism, which will be marked later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be many tears" — ms. Cortina says.
Began to flow can still appeal the sentence.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 plane will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects after fixing in the markets in Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered, and to Europe.
"We count that in total we will receive such arrangements more, than on 170 copies of planes of this kind", - quotes "Interfax" of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, told them at a press conference with the prime minister of France Jean-Marc Airo.
The head of the Russian government noted that with the French colleagues serious cooperation because it is a joint project is configured.
We discussed today, some financial issues that are associated with insurance, but we hope that after the plane will become stronger in the markets in Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope it will ever be delivered and to France" - the Russian prime minister stressed.
SSJ-100 - plane built by the Sukhoi Civil Aircraft company, in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is based on the modern technology and offers a high quality standards and comfort in the segment in 100 passenger seats.
Goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work assiduously at training.
In the past two meetings of "Hawks" Khabibulin at first let through six pucks from "Tampa Bay" and then four from "Ottawa" and, in the second game was replaced after the fourth let-through puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not manage it, - Khabibulina quotes CSNChicago.
I should find confidence on training, perhaps it is worth impending them as games, and to try to achieve the best results.
You need to learn the last game and work over the deficiencies that have been.
There are several small components that I should improve, but in training I feel pretty well.
But for some reason after several heads everything turns into several snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I am a one - always try to hold perfect game.
If I pass four, five, six, I'm not happy.
No matter what happens before my gate.
I still work myself not to let through as many pucks.
It's great that my your team-mates support, but in principle, everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to implement them much better.
But that was what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to win back the next game better.
Energy of Dnepropetrovshchina began its unique program to save... nests of storks
In the old times becoming accustomed to the yard of storks, peasants to the high column set the wheels from a cart and heavy nest is good on it saved.
Such special support are not set for a long time so storks chose columns of power lines - bound industries rely on wires thanks to what the aistiny settle costs reliably.
The grandmother Anya near which house in the village of Ivanovka of petrikov area years twenty there lives the aistiny family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite the efforts of its residents.
Birds put top new industries, and the bottom layer already gave between wires, is on the verge of collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for seven storks who clustered each year, at the metochion, removed and raised for the summer of three to four chicks, but there is no wish to remain without electricity.
As soon as birds flew to warm regions, the grandmother Anya convened in Tsarichansky RES, which has the support.
And did not even expect that there would react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest in general still remains - the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky said.
On the wires that turned out, in fact, already in the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kg corrosive began.
At any time of the bird could be lost from the electrical discharge.
And local residents risked remain without electricity because of damage wires.
Therefore linear tuners began operation to rescue the nest, and any longer for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk national university, who developed the scheme to transfer the nest helped.
They provided training for staff in regional networks.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of nests.
To begin estimated that in the area in an emergency state there are more than 50 aistiny "apartments".
For their renovation, the special metal platforms recalling the crater were welded.
The base is knotted willow branches, and then transferred old nest there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old industries as the basis that birds have learned a nest and returned to it.
Already then storks will complete housing.
A month ago in the village of the eel of the novomoskovsky area, the first nest was reconstructed.
Near the electrosupport put a new reinforced concrete column and has posted a platform with the old, has inhabited nest.
The entire operation cost to energy engineers nine thousand UAH.
And the other day, the same warm-houses took place in the village of Ivanovka of petrikov area on the grandmother Ani metochion.
Here the platform was fixed in the old location, only raised over wires.
Watchers are confident that a thorough, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" underwent capital repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction expects four more nests in pokrovsky and Tsarichansk Areas of Dnepropetrovshchina.
Incidentally, while one rescue rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day all area was flown by a sad message - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky area, in the opening day of hunting for pheasants, poachers for the sake of entertainment shot the swan family living on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - locals fed them and did not offend.
When villagers, hearing gunshots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans already pipe-borne water the dead.
At present the Apostolovsky district office of police finds out who shot the birds included in the Red List.

Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
It seems to me, we on about 15 years ago returned.
The Sports minister Vitaly Mutko expressed the view of unrest in the stands during the Russian Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartacus".
I'm a supporter of the organizers of sporting events were responsible for all this: clubs, the league, RFU.
But we see that they took a drgy position.
They're waiting for someone will come from the party and will bring order.
It is very good position, but not entirely correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite the stewards, but not let matters drift.
We are now developed a government decision-in-principle on rules of conduct at stadiums.
When it is accepted, we will closely deal with this issue.
But I still will necessarily invite to myself all the organizers of football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state supposedly give the act faster.
The feeling that is fans of "Bavaria" to Yaroslavl came and made it all.
And we are onlookers.
And in general, it is terrible - to see how the rostrum is watered from a fire engine.
And it in the country, which is preparing for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we are on 10-15 years ago returned", - Mutko said.
A lawyer with cocaine dependence who warned the leader of a criminal group on the police investigation, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided information to Crime Boss to Neil Skarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be opened
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool royal court.
The prestigious lawyer who said the drug baron about major police investigation because he was afraid of revealing the secret drug addiction, was jailed for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave criminal authority to Neil Skarboro classified information to investigate its work for drug trafficking after has been threatened because of the cocaine.
A lawyer who nicknamed the Bash and nicknamed among criminals "a cool lawyer" was arrested at his home in 2011 after police operation on surveillance Scarborough of which he represented in the court related to drugs earlier.
Officers noticed how 32-year Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn of the County of Lancashire, while that was at the dinner of the bar association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta "regularly used" class A drug after tests showed trace amounts of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Within eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get illegally information on arrests of two people at the request of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under surveillance as part of a widespread investigating criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire and Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire at the time.
They and 32 more persons were imprisoned later after the police withdrew during a series of raids heroin and cocaine for the sum of £1.5 million and also more than £200 thousand cash.
42-year-old Ditta said information to criminals because of fear that his cocaine dependence will be disclosed.
Today in the Liverpool royal court of Ditt which works in a law firm of Forbes Solicitors, which is in Blackburn it was disgraced after recognition of his guilt in two cases of alleged obstruction of justice following the results of a three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the crown.
He admitted storage of cocaine at a previous court sessions.
Exposure of a lawyer happened after police investigating the activities of Scarborough discovered that he regularly spoke from Ditt by telephone from February 2011.
Two detectives traced the suspect and establish how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and posted drugs, 60 per cent purity in a black glove for golf under waste bins of counsel.
Shortly after the Scarborough repeatedly broadcasted called up from Ditt who Ivud Park of the Blackburn Rovers team was at the dinner at a football stadium.
A lawyer returned home behind drugs; among them nine talk took place.
The court learned that Ditta "regularly took" cocaine after tests found class A drug traces in his hair, a purse and on their credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, however denied the cocaine use, told that talked to the suspected dealer as that was his client, and insisted that their communication is "lawyer secret".
During the detention of Ditt took the wallet and tried to take out some credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, the pattern of hair was also taken from it.
For questioning by police he said that, along with the workplace, he has both a home office, and clients came to her home on legal affairs.
The court, however, knew that after important arrests it called the largest contributors to drug trafficking, which number he represented in court earlier to say that detectives know about them.
In an angry speech of Anne White said: "If someone is also aware that it is not necessary to break the law, this is a criminal lawyer".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing its position of the criminal lawyer as he entered too close relationship with certain clients.
Contact that we are talking about — that is not simply a drug dealer, and the drug dealer supply of medication for their own lawyer.
Some of his talk will certainly be lawful, as he was their lawyer.
But it largely has exceeded the limits of the normal relations of the lawyer and his client.
It had intervened with the police investigation as hard as you can allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour their profession, and disgraced it.
He, too, came up with certain clients, in particular Scarborough and allowed to question the lack of interest.
Ditta did not admit guilt and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer whom I am not and would like to pass information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would make it immediately".
But after the meeting, the senior officer Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta turned from the criminal lawyer into the criminal had just begun to getting drugs at organized crime figures".
His addiction to cocaine has made it hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main actors in criminal groups who requested it to gain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of ethics and inspire in society trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed the trust and tried to be met with the profession.
Investigations into the case of Mr. Ditt conducted division of Lancashire on particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already made it a sentence in three cases of storage of cocaine, and now also on obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve just punishment for offenders.
Let this case will serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of law.
We will find you and we will bring to justice.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after a confession in conspiracy to supply of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
35 more people participating in fraud in the sum were sentenced to 153 years for the crimes connected with drugs.
On the site of Ditt organized conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he said that the work of his dream - is a lawyer representing clients with the death penalty in America, the ideal partner for him at dinner — Mohammed Ali, and motivation in work - this inequality.
Producers of jets are at war on seat width, when on the game large orders
Among the leading manufacturers of planes fierce dispute regarding the width of the seats of a tourist-class on long-range missions erupted, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.
The dispute is fostering round the width of the seats, provided on long-haul flights to passengers of the economy class, whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the statements about the effectiveness of the last aircraft proposed Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the implementation of the industry standard that would provide a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in salons of economy class, but her main American competitor to Boeing said that airlines must solve it.
The dispute goes when aircraft manufacturers compete on sales of more and more large versions of the twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and on the effects potentially record orders are expected from 17 to 21 November.
Configuration of the rear of the plane — especially whether 9 or 10 people in a row sit — is central to the alleged economic efficiency of new projects "mini-airbuses".
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accomodate 20,687 people based on seats in economy class more than 17 inch in width posted on 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy class of 350 people on the seats 18 inches wide rowed on 9.
Giants in aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus addresses directly to the public before an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
It did recently as may be the beginning of new advertising war, demonstrating to financiers a slide from three people in the restaurant next to each other under the name "would You agree to it? "
"Boeing proposals long-haul flights on seats of narrower than at the regional turboprop aircraft" — head of the sales of Airbus John Leahy said.
With changing diets people gain weight, but plane seats dramatically has not changed.
Among the early 1970s when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards of modern distant travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the Department of Health of the United States.
The grasp of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the health service of the US.
Airbus claims that her competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s when the average grasp of the waist of those who were named by "jet public" recently, was already.
Airbus said that commissioned a study showing that the additional inch in width of the seat improves the quality of sleep for 53 per cent.
Boeing challenges Airbus figures by the size of seats and said that producers should not interfere with decisions on how to airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that ease of salon depends not only on seat width.
"It's actually is limited to providing to airlines choice and the ability to do that in their view they should make for success" — an expert from Boeing in salons Kent Kreyver said.
They don't want that we decided to them, which will do for them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase in space on each side, but for suppliers, they tend to be a factor that may affect the profits.
Behind this dispute there is a race for orders for aircraft evaluated on at least $700 billion at the catalogue prices in the coming decades — there is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As for the first reported in July, Reuters news agency, the location of seats — him that stirs up rivalry in the fight between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing declare 20 per cent increase in profitability in one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models in comparison with the market leader in this segment, 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER.
The alleged characteristics of Boeing are partly based on comparison of 10-seater ranks 777X with original 9-seater configuration of ranks a constructive solution 777.
The prize in specific prime cost declines when compared with 10-seater configuration, currently in use.
"The reason why Boeing does it, is to compressive more seats and make the aircraft more competitive compared with our development" — Kevin Keniston, head of the department of comfort for passengers of Airbus in Europe said.
On the other hand, analysts say parlours with complete 10-seater series for existing the 777th indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangements that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is caused by the threat from the 777th model" — a specialist in the interior of the passenger compartment Mary Kirby, the founder and WFP Girl Network editor said.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver a chair, but offer a catalogue of vendors from that airlines can choose.
The sellers of jets traveling the world even carry with them roulettes to check the competing lay-out.
Extolling comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with very dense configuration of salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus proposals A350 with 10-seater ranks, but said that it still did not sell it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of salons, offering broader places when passing on some of the planes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern planes as experts say, her appeal to a new industry standard "will hardly" take off "but can divert attention from a wave of sales of the model 777X.
Oleinikov: third of the villages of the Moscow region the Fully subsidized
The lieutenant governor of the Moscow region Yuri oleinikov said that almost a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
In total donations from the budget of the region receive 187 settlements of 288.
In 2013 187 settlements of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
Share of benefits in the revenue for the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - absolutely subsidized.
Within the budget security from the regional budget about 25 billion roubles go ", - oleinikov said.
Also vice governor noted that only at three urban settlements - mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the amount of income of the budget was more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Proceeds of rural communities in many areas less than 3 million roubles, "it is not enough at all".
Maintenance costs of local administrative facilities in 88 settlements of Moscow area are made by over 70%, "thus decline in quality of services is observed", Oleynikov noted.
Previously he requested municipal leaders of the Moscow region to think out November eko-settlements need integration, the association to urban districts or change of administration.
These proposals will be met by the end of January.
Before the governor of the Moscow region said that within the administrative reform in the Moscow region is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisk, kashirskoye, solnechnogorsk, Kolomna areas, Lyubertsy and Kotelnikakh is request for integration of municipalities.
Discuss this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The chairman of the Moscow regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov also stated that about 30 villages in 12 districts of Moscow region plan to consolidate all in the future admreforma.
It is bound by that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region less than a third have the "acceptable" financial base, and 100 is subsidised.
The concern about security in Mozambique increases due to a conflict of influential people
Under Zamora Machel statue looking at them from top to bottom, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the Maputo centre to chant slogans on the world at a demonstration, rare here.
"We want the return of the world; we want stability "— Vanessa said de Sousse, executive director of investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country, it replaced a business suit with the t-shirt adorned with an inscription "We require security" in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday the crowd at capital Square of Independence.
Within two weeks almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo came — these are one of the most brutal clashes since a truce over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was supported at first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then the government of the apartheid era of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the armistice of 1992, it is the opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country hardly will again come down to a full-scale conflict, but recent events forced to be fidgety foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal fields in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling party Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party accuse each other of the created tensions.
Renamo's party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on the former rebels then flared when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakama — the leader of the group, told the Financial Times of Fernando Mazanga, the representative Renamo.
The government blames Renamo instituting clashes, accusing party of the attack on soldiers.
The president Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Guebuza said AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt the "loser" who wanted to use "all that remained of his forces to try to prove that he can force the government, their own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that wars want to avoid.
However, concerns grew after the message that Mazanga said Renamo's refusal of the 1992 peace accord.
He said the Financial Times that meant non-compliance with the agreement by party Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness" — said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between parties made for easing of intensity which was increased by a series of collisions this year a little.
"It is two influential people (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) who faced foreheads" — Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open university and expert in Mozambique said.
None of them is not a good negotiator and none of them are not prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The party of Renamo, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo been falling since 1992, whereas new party — the democracy movement of Mozambique (MDM) that was founded by a former member Renamo, as expected, was improving its performance on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza who should resign next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want the world because he does not want to leave the presidency" — said Mazanga.
It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has, however, it has carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key road leading from the North to the South.
Most of the fights took place in Sofala province which is a few hundred kilometres North of Maputo, but includes Beira — port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June of Rio suspended the use of tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened with attack on the railway.
Mazanga it was evasive when asked him whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo's party wanted "to alert the international community that matters in Mozambique go too well", – said Mazanga.
Instability strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also excited by corruption, slow rate of development and kidnappings which became frequent recently, speaks Fernando Lim, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country had the government and the president who has to find a solution to these problems" — he says.
Omar Sultuan, the demonstrator, said that people just want stability.
"No one is initiated by neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the resumption of peace, they want a free access to roads" — he said.
Instructions for use electronic devices on aircraft in Australia in the meantime, will remain in force
Passengers of the Australian airlines will need and turn off further the tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the U.S. to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allowed the American carriers to change the procedures so that passengers can read books, watch video or play games on the devices during take-off and landing, provided that those will remain in "flight mode".
Passengers can already do it during the main part of flight, but many irritates that they have no access to the electronic books during take off and landing.
The Australian media believe this decision, which demanded that the American airlines to carry out a vast amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change the procedures in the near future.
In the office of civil aviation security also noted that they consider the application, but stressed that restrictions on use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight still ​ ​ work in Australia.
"Office of civil Aviation security has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices on planes" now — it said.
The fact is governed by rules that require airlines to provide maintaining security at any time, and from passengers — to follow safety rules on which they are reported by crew members.
The Virgin company that already discussed with the Office of civil Aviation Security increased use on board the entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but said that it will follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome a review by the Office of civil Aviation security of the question of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (on board wireless entertainment system) is by our planes" print secretary said.
Qantas said that will follow the rules in place at the time.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and soon we do not plan it to change" — she said.
The resolution FAU extends to the American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we certainly will carefully study the solution of the FAW and reason, caused it.
For carriers of the US the impact of the resolution will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Traders will have to prove that their planes have resistance to radio frequency interference from mobile devices, and also to review benefits, training materials, rules on the transport of hand luggage and instructions to passengers.
"After the airline will test and will confirm the noise the stability of the fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices, such as tablets, ebooks and smartphones, at any height" — said FAS.
In rare cases poor visibility the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices in a boarding.
In addition, according to the panel's recommendation, heavier devices must be placed under seats or in the overhead luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Obama refuses the words on health care
Among the criticism storm president Obama is pushing back on the often repeated, unambiguous pledge yesterday that "if you like your medical insurance plan, you can save it".
Seeing that hundreds of thousands people receive notices of the termination of rendering services from the providers, republicans scarified the president in recent days that he misleads the American society.
Yesterday Obama adjusted its initial public promise slightly.
"Most people who have health insurance, which works can save it" — he said in his speech in Boston.
For what he called "revival in the news" on the end of service delivery, Obama called for the Americans receiving these notices to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than projected.
"You get more favourable conditions" — he said.
The administration announced that it should be no surprise that 5% of people who buy insurance themselves may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the law on affordable health care.
"Let me say directly to those Americans: you deserve better "— Sibelius in a statement to the committee on Energy and trade of the House of Representatives in Washington said.
Sibelius who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the platform for Internet sales goes "dreadfully poorly" since October.
"I'm frustrated and angry as everything — she said.
— I very much want to return your trust ".
The angry Sibelius dropped this phrase which was caught by the included microphone, to the assistant sitting behind it at yesterday's hearings in chamber after hot debate with the member of the House of Representatives Billey Long, the State of Missouri republican, about, whether she is obliged to enter the program of health care of Obama.
After more than three hours of hearings Long once again strongly requested information Sibelius why "architect" of the law on Affordable Health care has voluntarily waived the insurance sponsored by the government to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she imposes on millions of Americans now.

Koulson resorted to breaking of phone to check the secret message
The former editor of the News of the World newspaper Andy Koulson allegedly used "breaking of telephone, surveillance and the opposition" in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clarke held the post of Minister of interior at that moment.
The prosecutor, q.c. Andrew Edis informed Old-Bailey's court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received doubtful news that Clarke meets the "an attractive special sovetnitsa" Hannah Polbi.
The newspaper requested the private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to hack voice mail of Polbi and trapped her at home to an interview, but also Koulson too called it and left voice messages — heard court.
"Charge believes that Mr. Koulson who is currently NotW editor - it is not such a person who will stand next to someone's house, hoping to take someone by surprise, he is the person who likes to offer history for people to see what they say" — Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: breaking of phones, surveillance and the opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first?
If he knew about hacking phones?
He said that no, we say: "Oh, yes! "
Rumours of Clarke's novel for the first time drew attention to edition to News of the World when the source, which is sexually interested in Ms. Polbi was said: "Don't waste time, it with Charles".
The tape with the voice messages received from his phone at least three times was withdrawn from Mulkeyr's house in August of last year.
Investigators also found computer records of the private detective in which Miss Polbi and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period when she was under surveillance, the grandparents of Ms. Polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, the former chief reporter Neville Tyorlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled surveillance movement of Ms. Polbi.
Having left it a voice message on June 18 the 2005th, Koulson told: "I have a history which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I very much would like to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Edis said that Koulson's participation in this story happened on the same script as other influential people, for example to the former interior Minister David Blankett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Koulson imposed confrontation with Mr. Blankett on the affair with a married woman while he met sootvetchitsy Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Koulson and Brooks deny conspiracy to other people in order to hack into the phones from 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyr, Tyorlbek and Uezerap admitted breaking of phones.
In grounds of the Ministry of Interior there is no sister Circle group, which in the U.S. ranked Leps
In the databases of the Russian security officers of fraternal Circle group, which Washington was on a singer Grigory Leps, it does not appear.
As noted to "Interfax" in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation after in mass media there were messages on entering by the U.S. Treasury Department of Grigory Leps into check lists on suspicion in belonging to the Euroasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle", all databases were checked, but such group it was revealed not.
Distribution of this information helps to uphold the myth of the so-called "the Russian mafia" that was ostensibly working abroad, believe in power structures.
"Even in the name, 'The fraternal circle', is a certain element of mystery, a hint of a secret box contains.
"All this is very similar to a PR event", the negotiator of the agency said.
The US Treasury announced on 31 October, entering in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "sister Circle" of Arthur Badalyan, hryhoriy Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The names on this list are suspected of links with a certain Vladislav Leontyev and gafurov Rakhimov that are seen as influential members of criminal groups and are in sanctions lists of the US since February 2012.
According to American authorities, hryhoriy Leps "serves as a courier for delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
In the production centre of grigorii Leps declined to comment on allegations of the US to the singer, calling them "nonsense".
In 2011, the US President Barack Obama carried fraternal Circle syndicate to the number of "significant transnational organized crime groups" and asked the Ministry of Finance "to undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations".
Entering the man in black lists of the U.S. Treasury entails freezing of its assets to the US and a ban on business contacts with it of people living in the States.
Scientists shed light on how the movements of the tail of the dog are associated with her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dog wagging its tail to the right side (in terms of the dog) while alarmed dogs vilna with a tail, mainly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in wiggle by the tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, the neuroscientist from Trent university, says: "It is well known that gave people the left and right sides of the brain differently participate in shaping driving forces who cause positive or negative emotions".
Here we tried to look at it and at other species.
He added that the same as a person at dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to multidisciplinary povilivaniye khvostov of other dogs, researchers tracked animals when they watch movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analysed their behaviour.
Perhaps we will understand already soon why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have demonstrated to dogs of video with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors, and we can manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right".
When animals saw for the rest emotionless dog moved the tail to the right (in terms of the dog wagging tail), they remained entirely weakened.
But when they noticed that the tail inclined mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging tail), their heartbeat became frequent and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think dogs deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs learned from the experience, what movements they should worry, and what — no.
He notices: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and often wiggle their tail to one side are associated with more friendly behaviour, and the right side provides less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience".
Researchers say that these results can yield to owners, vets and trainers a better understanding of emotions of the animal.
A specialist in behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, visiting fellow at veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said he was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides have value for dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from the university of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn heads to the left if look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if look at the happy dog.
And in other scientific work of the university of Victoria in Canada, said: "Dogs approached more frequently a dog robot when wiggle of her tail went to the left, but not to the right instead of becoming alarmed — contrary conduct in relation to the Italian research".
He said that the differences could be because dogs are in various studies not fully perceived animals in movies or dogs robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs respond to the real dogs, he explained.
"While on various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs no exception" — he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour could perhaps be registered very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another.
Whether the elite of Europe is prepared to do business with England?
Campaign of Business for Britain was launched in April with the commitment to bring together representatives of business and to determine which changes the founders of prosperity and jobs of Great Britain want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to introduce the ideas of Great Britain, business and the EU.
The YouGov company interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad swath of business in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
Findings of the poll would be surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses looking for export capabilities beyond Europe now, paying particular attention to the countries that modernized and grow, while EU countries to stagnate.
They want the government gave priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, but did not spend time in a long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views of specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to the laws on production, most business leaders felt that control of these core competencies must be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that spending from regulation by Brussels now outweigh the benefits of staying in a trade area of Europe - 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally, most of the proyevropeyska configured from all companies have agreed with him even.
The last and most indicative - our survey of business executives found that a clear majority wants Britain taught a course of a variation of the contract and for its relations with the EU based on trade, but not on policy.
This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists "significant change" that will return powers back to Britain.
The stakes are high - fulfilling the changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for Great Britain will provide 16 per cent shift in the voting remaining in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports its plan to review conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.
It also shows that the case is that the review will lead to significant shift in the current balance of power back towards Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are becoming more and more necessary because the eurozone took a way of closer economic and financial association.
The priority should be given to jobs and growth in Britain, and as show our survey, it means a strengthened focusing on trade for business and fundamental changes in standard activities of Brussels.
The politician in Turkey went on hunger strike against the wall of the border with Syria
In the middle of October, the authorities began the separation wall near the town of Nusaibing in south-eastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of pro-Kurdish party to PMD was sharply against construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin Aisha, which is on the border with Syria Gökhan went on hunger strike to protest against the barrier on the Turkish border with Syria, told RIA-Novosti in the press service of the Party of Peace and democracy (the BDP) on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protests.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey Muammer Gyuler at first denied the construction fact, then stated that the wall was built for border security.
"The mayor Nusaybina to Aisha Gökhan, a member of the BDP, went on hunger strike, converting a protest against the wall into deadly fight", said in the press-service of party.
The mayor believes that the wall is designed to insulate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, Kurds crossed the border freely during half a century.
"It is a inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree", - quote to Aisha Gökhan representatives of the party.
According to the press-service, on November 7 in Nusaibing a meeting against the barrier is planned.
This morning in the Saratsky area, the driver of the Peugeot car left on the opposite lane for 115 km of the route Odessa-Reni, and faced bus in which there were six people.
The press-service of the office of GSChS in Odessa region reports about it.

In Siberia you should not be a Wigan: the Orangery tomato will not replace soup
Why the vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent for RIA-Novosti unclarified.
The people who absolutely denied animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here to them not to transfer winter without loss to health, and no casing tomatoes compensate for them, the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of the Day of Wigan consider.
To drink oil in litres
The strict vegetarianism when refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia to adhere to such strict rules in food, at least insalubriously to health.
Full refusal of animal products is harmful.
Animal protein contains essential amino acids that are very difficult to repair the vegetable.
It is necessary to include in a seimas at least milk or eggs "- the dietician Marina Bogay is sure.
It cites as an example the fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest with him vegetable/seed oil - underwear.
"To consume it in quantities are necessary for a man, you must drink in litres! "- the nutritionist says.
Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to diet in the winter.
During this season, the vegetarianism is particularly called into question.
In the context of our realities require exceptional food.
Not to freeze the increased calorie content is needed.
"If the person limits himself on animal products, respectively, the calorie content he did not gather additionally", he says.
A registered dietitian Olga paznyak agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit isn't an option.
It is better for person to feed mainly on products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set to the best assimilation and uptake of these products.
And in winter, people don't want not cucumber pogryzt and hot soup or something else posytny "- the doctor explained the position.
According to her, from this, that vegetarians can eat, various cereals, grains, legumes, local vegetables, remaining apples at the winter, the frozen berries are relatively useful.
But, clearly, it is not enough for good food.
According to a gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a level of vitamins sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
Full transition to vegetarianism in our rigid environment when the temperature could change in days to 30 degrees and in May snow lies is inappropriate.
The body to life needs energy, and that, above all, fat "- is made by the doctor.
Doctors note that the veganstvo is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
And in line to vegetarianism, we give them the defective.
Pregnant women also need more protein, vitamins and microelements from the menu.
"Veganki them is received less", - Bogay is sure.
Arifulina said that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play those toys that wants".
It has already created organism, the skeleton, bodies.
And yet the children should eat fully.
If parents give it any microelements or amino acids, choosing to him that he would eat, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.
"Tomorrow, you will not restore the lack of certain substances for brain development, sight, bones any more", she says.
All interviewed medical professionals agree in opinion on low quality of growing in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruit.
That lead to us and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer microelements necessary for us than (grown) in an open ground.
"The Quality of products, not that", says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to reap a higher yield causes damage to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and not fragrant" - the doctor gave examples, adding that they were likely to be stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizers.
Also become suppliers not of vitamins, and pulp.
The Head of Laboratory of Siberian physical-technical institute of Agricultural Issues, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with it.
She said that at the right approach and respect for all the rules and requirements in greenhouses cultivation of full vegetables is possible.
If they try to banish more from square metre, of course, and will begin to water more frequently, and to overfeed plants with mineral fertilizer.
For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes quickly grow, they large but watery and unsweetened ", she explains, adding that the quality issue first depends conscience on the manufacturer.
Russia out of the fight for urban pollution cars
Attempts to solve traffic problems of the major cities were observed in the majority of megacities of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
It was typically talked or their reorganization and expansion of roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and timing of their use.
The example of Singapore, where the rigid quotas for a rise in the number of private cars is imposed is widely known, and the right of acquisition are bought at auction.
Its price may exceed the price of a car by two to three times.
The European cities, including London, imposed fees for entrance to the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, enter the so-called green zones where travelers is allowed cars with certain ecoclass also using quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The environment agency the protection of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 "the five-year plan of clean air" in the total cost about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As said "Kommersant" the director of enforcement of transport pollution of municipal bureau of Environmental protection of Beijing Lee Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year period - reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, growth in the number of private cars to the greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) as well as increase for no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.
According to the agency, now Road in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the general air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme - limiting the use of the road, as well as additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, urban measures of "The green five-year plan" include the transition to fuel European standards accelerated compared with another country, the introduction of local system ecostandards and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on outdated vehicles (in addition, a boost financial programme to replace old cars on hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and the office), development of public transport (including high-speed).
The ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the People's Republic of China their six) one day in a week (the relevant information contains in registration plate of the vehicle), and also delivery of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of action of a lottery, the total of permissions to registration of private cars in Beijing made only a third of number of 2010) is also among automobile innovations of Beijing.
According to the existing "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020" state program, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in their 2012 was 138).
According to the Ministry to protect the Environment and Natural Resources, in 2011 on "mobile sources" 41% of all pollutant emissions in the atmosphere of cities fell.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars exceed industrial and, in St. Petersburg, by nine times ten times.
In the Russian Federation so far, only start thinking about opportunities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that the administrative and fiscal measures to suppress demand for road trips - business clearly unpopular, they can be taken by society only on condition of their total universality.
If Moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters poorly sensitive to any regulatory to influence the official and personal cars and cars "exclusive" users that the total number is not less than 200,000 (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).
The other day urbanists from the WHAT center in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of the urban areas between a housing estate, the area of pavement and the number of road transport is analysed.
Key findings of investigators: the city centre is provided by roads twice smaller required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but storage of cars, not to expand, and to reduce the carriageway (the streets became more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of a security zone of the historic center (the total area about 3212 hectares covering a number of central regions of the city).
Will lead tax maneuver that increases the tax on mining (MET) on oil at the same time, with lower export duties and excise rise to a rise in the price of fuel.
According to experts, these measures may provide additional 619.3 billion rubles in the budget.
Trip on dirt, rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bvelle and his team perform almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country of doctors there is not a lot of — only one on 5,000 people
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. George Bvelle — one top 10 heroes of CNN of 2013.
You can vote for it or for any of the other 10 main characters that he became a Hero of the year of CNN.
This person would receive $250 million to continuation of the outstanding work.
For 21 years George Bvelle saw his father was restored to life and falling again into unconsciousness, wandering on hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Dzhamef Bvelle was injured in road accident in 1981, near Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon.
First at it the hand was only broken, but the arising prior infection spread to the brain and caused bruising that recalled itself until the end of life.
"In Cameroon, there were no neurosurgeons — George Bvelle said.
If we had money, we would make it from Cameroon.
Instead of this Bvelle escorted for years, the father in a crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment which they could get.
"It is hard — Bvelle said.
— You can leave the house at 5 a.m., come running in the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There is a lot of patients.
Some may die because they should wait.
The situation is not much changed since the father Bvelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States — one doctor for 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could address to the doctor, it would be too expensive for much of them.
Two of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health expenditure in it are private.
"Their only problem is poverty — Bvelle said.
— And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives ".
Seeing the suffering of the father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle has resolved to do anything about it.
Last year, Dr George Bvelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central hospital Yaoundé.
It also established ASCOVIME non-profit organization that provides countryside trips on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, and his group of volunteers assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, and to 30 people deadlock in vans, tie medical belongings to roofs and go on a rugged terrain to visit the villages in need.
Not always they are accompanied by good luck.
More than once they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they meet, as real heroes: it is a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms which local residents can only proposal.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for a holiday, and Bvelle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun.
The next morning, the crew begins accepting hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on each trip" — Bvelle said.
They come with all the district in a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics of the day off provides various medical services.
Many people were receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, the proposed points, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening the crew provides simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations were usually performed in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to cover operational and sanitary equipment processing, Bvelle and his volunteers work into the early morning hours of Sunday.
It is excessive speed, but rural musicians usually help maintain the commitment of the crew.
"They all night beating the drum that we were awake and continued to work" — Bvelle said.
On Sunday members of the crew go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students performed 700 free operations for last year, and they know that their aid may be of great value to those they help.
One person explained that the free operation to treat hernia received by him would enable it to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family" — the man said.
In addition to these clinical receptions at weekends and work in the hospital as a surgeon Bvelle also works at the nights in private clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, according to him, provides 60% of financing its non-profit organization; other means be covered through private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps" — Katie O'Malley, a medical student of the second year of Drekselsky university in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the group Bvelle said.
He always or in hospital, or attempts to earn money for the organization that it was possible to continue those campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bvella to achieve its objectives, is the ability of practice that they were never at home.
"We had the opportunity to assist on operations where we helped remove spots of blood or hold tools for doctor Bvelle" — O'Malley said.
As a student second-year student, you would never get this possibility in America.
Student volunteers usually pay the journey to Cameroon, often arriving with the proposed drugs.
But on arrival in Yaoundé their food, transport and training Drew by Bvelle.
"It is a hero, undoubtedly" — O'Malley said.
It provides the life of this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bvelle almost permanent the workload is not a difficult experience.
To help lead happy life to another, to keep its promise to the father — him that brings it great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work - Bvelle said.
— And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it that people laughed to reduce their pain.

To "the Russian mafia" in the US, the new name - "A sister circle" was finally assigned
This week, the black list of "the Russian mafia" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury entered into "A sister circle" of the three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and the Israeli.
A famous singer Grigori Leps, whom the US suspect of carriage of money to members of the group was one of the Russians.
In total in a black list of the US 22 people involved in "A sister circle" and six entities affiliated with it.
However, many experts have questioned that such organization does exist.
"A statement to 'A fraternal circle' is like trying to combine separate criminal groups" more, an expert in organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti said earlier.
In his view, "The fraternal circle" reflects a popular perception of "the Russian mafia".
"I didn't meet anybody in the Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such criminal organisation", - quotes Mr. Galeotti the American Center for research of corruption and organized crime.
A professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they also work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization" - the Centre for research of corruption and organized crime provides her words.
In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that "The fraternal circle" brings together in a greater measure of confidants of the Russian kingpin Aslan Usoyan known as Grandpa Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, Lasha Shushanashvili's activities and xachariah Kalashova, filled up the list in 2012, was closely associated with Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri mirzoev had to Grandpa Hassan nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals and have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united by rather common financial and criminal interests, for example supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal over inclusion in "A sister circle" of grigorii Leps, a favorite singer of the Russian president Vladimir Putin - drew the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we will get more detailed information in this regard such a decision why it in such lists was introduced was made from our American partner colleagues, the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov said.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said he would use chance of return as prime minister of Great Britain, but acknowledges that return is unlikely.
The night before in an interview to mark the fifth anniversary of the resignation, the 59-year-old politician set out the eyes of various aspects of domestic politics.
Since the resignation in June 2007, after ten years on the leader's post, Blair largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting the majority of the comments to foreign affairs and the role of ambassador to the Quartet of Middle Eastern peacekeepers.
Answering a question, whether it returned to the prime minister's position, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, told: "Yes, of course, but hardly it happens, so..."
The head coach "Milan" Massimiliano Allegri regretted neutral result in a match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with "Lazio".
The expert also noted that failures on the launch are caused by a series of injuries of the leading players.
It is a pity to me that we did not manage to win, - Allegri quotes Tmw.
The team played the sound match, having created 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we allowed nothing to "Lazio".
In the second Romans added, but in general I can't say that we lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
Last season we conducted a hit task in the Champions League.
Now we lag behind schedule, but it is caused by a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with nature.
However, our structure is also now good.
Look at Kaka who held a high-level meeting.
The British police hands to Assange delivery notification
The British police presented today, the notice of delivery of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for asylum.
In Scotland Yard declared that they handed to the 40-year-old Australian "the official requirement to be given" with the requirement to be in a police station, having added that in case of non-performance of this requirement it will be subject further to arrest.
Assange is threatened by an extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted the opportunities according to the British law when the Supreme Court rejected its appeal on an extradition this month earlier.
Fearing that Stockholm will transfer him to the US, on June 19 he took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, asking for this South American country of political asylum.
Scotland Yard "given to the 40-year-old man a statutory requirement to be given that requires him to come to a police station in the day and time at our choice" as the spokesman said.
He continues to violate release conditions on bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the extradition of warning of the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. for presentation of possible charges of espionage to him after the publication more than 250,000 US diplomatic expulsions on the WikiLeaks website opposing privacy.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris on presentation of the novel "Eltyshev" translated into French.
Let's recall, its this novel was a finalist of four awards: "Yasnaya Polyana", "the Russian Booker", "The national bestseller" and "The big book".
And last year, the writer for the book was awarded the Order of the government of the Russian Federation in culture.
Roman Senchin - the undisputed leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and the Forties prose writers.
Virtually every publication of his strict, built on contemporary vital material stories and stories causes hot discussions among critics of the most different directions.
It can be argued that the aggregate articles about prose and Senchin's journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature since the late 1990s, before the start of the 2010th.
In discussions about works of "one of the most disputable modern writers", according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, mostly it is talked that its participants understand as the word "literature" what see the present and the future not only our literature, but also life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include a majority of articles and reviews of regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and reviews are given, usually in reduction in sections "Paragraphs"...
Snowden could be questioned in Russia
The ex-employee of the American intelligence services Edward Snowden is likely to not travel outside of Russia to give evidence in cases of the wiretap of telephone conversations of the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
As told "Interfax" on Friday, the source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from the State prosecutor's office of Germany in writing or internally in Russia.
Edward Snowden's travel outside of Russia is almost deleted.
"In this case it will lose their refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by the countries - U.S. allies", the negotiator of the agency said.
"However, in principle, the State prosecutor's office of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written matters to Snowden", added the source, adding that this issue should be worked out at domestic level.
Previously, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify on the case of a wiretap the American intelligence services of negotiations of the German chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany.
The ex-employee of the CIA it clear that he knows a lot of things.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA blocked all its movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But this requires to clearly define all conditions of his arrival ", - Shtrebele reported to Euronews TV channel.
The advocate Snowden Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement by a source of "Interfax", said that his client can cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how - will solve.
A US citizen Edward Snowden working for the National Security Agency (NSA) of the US and the CIA fled to Hong Kong in May 2013 then published information on classified intelligence operations of the US on surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flied through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because its passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities which in absentia brought him serious charges and prior to the beginning of August remained in a transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.
The first of August Snowden received a document on temporary asylum to it in the territory of Russia for a period of the year and on the same day, left "Sheremetyevo".
Yesterday, the American's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client had obtained a job in "a major Russian company".
Last week reported the German media about surveillance by the NSA Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, Americans started listening to telephone conversations of the chancellor in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly in the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of these data announced that surveillance Merkel violated laws and sovereignty of Germany.
It is announced the release of the racing Land Rover series
Inside there is a racing seats and six-dot safety-belts, and a system of internal communications.
It is additionally can receive the upgraded brakes, the package of services providing access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the car between activities.
Drew Bauler, the managing director of the Bowler motorsport, said: "The the rally turning in Bowler exchanged".
Some of them not experienced riders, but people who are looking for unrest, adventure and access to the actions of a world class.
We are pleased to offer this way, in partnership with Land Rover and Isas and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines rally in Britain and abroad, and to prepare the participants for harsh conditions and the realities of the rally raid.
We have great pleasure developed counsel Challenge car — it will be really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February to training and testing, and also an opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and in the Middle East.
Children must learn myths and legends as "models of the way of life", the author says.
Tales from the Torah could show that "the brute force cannot defeat distinguished cunning" and legends of king Arthur show how it is important to have dreams.
Saying that many myths will be "too wild, too blatant and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools", Crossley-Holland supports "careful selection" of the texts suitable on age.
"I think it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education" — he said.
I supported their introduction to the curriculum twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralistic" the sponsors and teachers "battles interest" off to school, and the main ideas "are sublimated" in an exciting stories.
Crossley-Holland, which was translated by "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon language, as well as "The collection of Norwegian myths" for Penguin and "British folk Tales" publishing house wrote, said: "Of course, You can have intentions, but it is better for you to keep them around".
Perhaps big difference between an adult author writing for adults, and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
That everything should be simplified or lead not that to a happy ending, but it is essential that there was a innate understanding of the good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it is open through history, but it is not clearly formulated.
Old principle: show, not to say.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
It first of all crisis of defaults on poor consumer credit and mass dismissals of workers.
Our main concern now - not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
Recently it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce queues "- the chief economist at Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graf said, introducing a quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal growth of salaries in Russia - about 10%.
At inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.
But profitability of the Russian companies falls so probably they will be established to improve staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising to 10%, GDP - only to 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies have faced profitability reduction.
If she did not grow up, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
The Russian business could raise the salaries, chief economist at Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin comments.
Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers high.
To lure staff from the party or to hold this, employers should raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr. Grafe, because of the highest rates on consumer loans of multiplicative effect this type of credit does not have on the national economy.
"We are no did not see the benefit for economy of consumer credit growth, money is not at odds on the economy, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments" - the economist said.
But the problem in other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on the poor loans.
They are taken by mostly relatively poor people who have nothing to provide in security.
Interest on such loans high.
As a result, do not return to their more often ", Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - possible crisis of defaults on poor loans.
The director of the HSE Bank institute Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of emerging banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, without access to cheap resources which the State Banks have, were forced to raise funds of the population with high interest.
In response, the State Banks came to the track of war and began to reduce lending rates, says economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot give out loans under the same per cent, or they will have a negative interest margins.
If the State Banks do not refuse a dumping, Russia is threatened by full bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
In recent weeks, the economist believes the cancellation of certificates of a number of banks as a harbinger of mass crash.
"The State Banks will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was never intended to systemic crisis ", the head of the institute warns.
But growth in consumption will slow down and without crisis of non-payments, believe in Investbank - because of failure of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military, put in the current version of the draft budget.
Partly the autumn to consumption will be broken by a freezing tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, lower inflation).
But only a point: if investments do not grow (and prerequisites to it are not yet available - see the reference), increasing consumption all the same will be slow, are confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not see prerequisites for implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet.
"The main risk is still falling oil prices", he says.
In his estimation, Russia's economy will begin to decline at the cost of oil less than 90 dollars/barrel.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank yet not in force to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation fell, and banks began to increase rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to an inflation targeting ", - Clemens Graf said.
The percentage the Central Bank policy does not affect market rates, only affects pace of interbank lending.
"For the Central Bank is the collapse of all hopes", - Clemens Graf assessed.
The money received at auctions of the Central Bank uses banks not lending to economy, and for the office of the liquidity
As soon as the rates are falling, the exchange rate changes at once, it means that the funds try to leave on speculation against ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work", Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to start up ruble in "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But it is necessary or to do it before, or to increase the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he says.
In his estimation, rouble exchange rate is now artificially by 10%.
I cut only one road - to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank has provoked in financiers while a reasonable doubt that the elimination of a currency corridor is not part of a policy along with their weakening of the ruble, it can bring down ruble much stronger.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap
A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met to Moscow Edward Snowden.
Whether in conversation the issue was discussed Snowden as a witness by the State prosecutor's office of Germany on the case of possible tapping the phone of German chancellor of the spetssltsuzhbama of the US could be interviewed.
Snowden offered to provide the necessary evidence.
The meeting would take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it know - Hans-Christian Strebele said, that he knows a lot of things.
And despite the fact that the National security agency run by Keith Alexander blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But you must first determine all conditions of his arrival clearly.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are now taking steps in response to the scandal over spying programmes of the US.
The Senate Committee on Intelligence approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. department of electronic investigation yesterday.
THE FAW: "Air passengers can use gadgets now by aircraft (but not to call from a mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use the electronic devices throughout the voyage to read, work, play games, movies and listen to music, but not to talk by mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes will occur immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented, will vary depending on airline, the FAU administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference said.
Airlines should show the FAW as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update the manuals for members of the flight crew and the rule to lay devices to conform to the new guidelines.
The FAW said that he had already received plans from some airlines to increased use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices soon" — said FAS.
Now passengers are required to disable the smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches the height of 10,000 feet and captain will not give a green light.
Passengers have to turn off devices again when the plane decreases to planting, and not to include them until the plane appears on earth.
According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxing, said the FAW.
Most of the new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, as expected, meet these criteria.
Laura Glejding, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a sure bet" — said Gleyding.
We frankly tired to feel like "persons on duty on school" when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection to surf, an exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at the height of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
It will be invited to passengers to switch the smartphones, tablets and other devices in a plane mode.
Thus, still any "Words with friends" — intellectual Internet game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on a smartphone in 2011 when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device when the plane was at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops, it will still be required to pile in the luggage compartment as they can hurt someone if fly on all salon.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also remain prohibited.
Regulatory powers to phone calls relate to the Federal Communications commission, but not the FAW.
The FAW can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month Mark Rozenker from the National Transportation safety Board, the national expert on the safety of the transport of CBS News, stated that cell phones are still regarded as risk.
"Cell phones — it is really a problem not only because they have the potential to interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is airborne" — Rozenker said.
The industry advisory committee created by the FAW to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allowed greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAW for the purpose of easing of restrictions on their use has increased.
Critics such as Democratic senator from Missouri Claire Makkaskil, argue that for the prohibition there is no compelling reasons of security.
Compliance with restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult to be provided as the use of devices becomes universal.
Some studies show that to a third of passengers forget or ignored instructions to shut down the devices.
The FAW started restricting use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of interference with the navigation and communication equipment when passengers launched with themselves FM radios — high-tech gadgets that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also developed and approved by the FAW as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers using Wi-fi at cruising altitude for several years.
The planes modified for Wi - Fi - systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners is adapted to greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices usually radiate radio signals of a much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit minimal signals when you turn the pages.
But the signs are more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those who achieved easing restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices, there was an Amazon.com company.
In 2011 the representatives of the company loaded the entire airliner devices for reading e-books Kindle and flew on him to check for problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAS advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether any risk is the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National association of air passengers said that considers interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only individual reports of pilots affirming that devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports, the very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAW allowed pilots to require passengers to disable devices during instrument landings in limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry has welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step toward passengers who now use a set of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAW acknowledges that the comfort of passengers was not incompatible with safety and security" — Roger Dow, the director-general of Tourist association of the USA said.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of an attempt to defame the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the eastern partnership a statement to the agency BNS made in the department of state security of the republic (DGB).
Information on published in DELFI portal.
According to a report, in particular Moscow is going "to specify" Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite, and to publish the falsified documents reportedly found in the Russian State archive, which concern the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to intelligence service, the preparation of information act is committed by the department of the analysis of public management processes of the presidential Administration on interregional and cultural ties with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Eugene Umerenkov who more than was once visiting Lithuania and who took part in congress of the Lithuanian people's party.
Also a party of exploitation allegedly is an employee of the division V. Smirnov.
As an intelligence service claims that Smirnov under cover scientific work until the end of 2012 was regularly to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and members of the media.
Now entry into the country is prohibited Smirnov.
The day before the president of Lithuania grybauskait announced that he knew about the cyberattack preparing on it.
In her view, the principal of the reasons a successful presidency of Lithuania in Council of the European Union and "the country's commitment to energy independence" is
The Lithuanian leader not once criticized earlier actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Kremlin Lithuania treat "insufficiently indeed".
In addition, grybauskait accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin of promotion to Lithuania of "only one needs".
Let's recall, in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of production does not meet sanitary-epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia will not lift the ban, the government is to prepare an appeal to the WTO.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could deprive the process of smoking of joy
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could deprive the process of cigarette smoking of joy.
One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing before tests in the public are necessary, to which some years, but professor Ronald Kristall from medical college will be required Whale Cornell in New York said that the first results encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a strategy of the use of a vaccine can help, finally, to millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all methods that are available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction strong enough to overcome it through these modern means" — professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start making a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing financial nicotine blow by a smoker.
In tests the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine subsequently, continued their normal activities.
And mice who had not been given a vaccine, "relaxed" and it is a sign that nicotine reached their brain, for the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine journal.
The previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine will probably be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories of antibodies.
Professor Kristall said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that she will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they will start smoking again, they will not receive from this joy because nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit" — he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further studies are needed.
Prewinter efforts.

Border Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Border Airlines plans to charge passengers to $100 that they are in hand luggage on board a flight.
Border Airlines plans to start raising up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave themselves all can.
The new payment for hand luggage extends to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Border said that will levy $25 if the tax is paid in advance, and $100 if traveling pay, with only have been at a gate.
The representative of the state border Kate O'Malley said the payment of $100 must force passengers to think of payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it" — she said.
Companies have begun charging fees for the first and second bag surrendered in luggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees fill so much, how many will be able, in your hand luggage placed in the top luggage compartments because of what in these compartments often there is no place.
Collection — one way to force passengers to carry by less on board.
O'Malley said the new charges not really for the sake of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers of border state that it becomes more difficult to find a place in the top luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the site of the airline would not have to pay.
This means that a passenger in turn at the opening to the flight border may be able to carry a bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at the check-in desks of border is designed to ensure that passengers will know about taxes before they get to the gate.
New charge border for hand luggage will not begun to be raised until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about the pay for baggage and other charges, but airlines adore them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street believe addition of baggage collection is familiar that airlines raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. entered the first charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter of Allegiant Air followed suit later.
The only other airline with such taxes is the Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen who closely tracks additional charges said.
In his assessment in the report of December 2011, the prosecution for hand luggage brings Spirit of $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior manager of the Midwest Airlines, flew the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting to him that he would find in the gate when passengers face unusual charge Spirit for hand luggage.
"The process of landing was the smoothest that I had seen in his career in airlines" — he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth, and the emergence of a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and landing held rapidly".
Border also follows Spirit on the payment of $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Border said that passengers who get soda or juice, can leave themselves all can and that adding coffee it will be available free of charge.
She will still distribute free of charge water.
US Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but denied it in seven months after passengers started to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
Border initiative of charging for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline — is its last resort to attract customers on its website.
Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
It allowed all airlines incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, but not to resort to online travel agency.
But border went further all in this area.
In September, he started to serve twice less bonus miles of often flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency.
On Wednesday it cut bonus number of miles to 25 per cent from a trip miles.
So, a trip to 1,000 miles with border purchased from online travel agency would allow to receive 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site border.
Border have a base of loyal customers in his hometown of Denver, but his case is reduced and becomes unprofitable.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities were reduced by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to correct border finance within sale to airline.
Putin made impunity for friend Assad
And now - news because of the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck rockets of the Russian production, which reportedly intended to "Hezbollah".
Syria today met an important condition - to destroy the production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
It was made under the agreement brokered by Russia and that allowed the US not to launch military action, which they closely approached this summer.
In more detail our chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel will tell on weapons and that all this means to the Syrian president.
Washington stated that Assad's regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And punishment came.
But not in the form of the American bombing, and in the form of a transaction that Assad's friend - Vladimir Putin arranged.
Syria will refuse the chemical weapons to the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts reported that Syria put out of action, the stated factories on the production of chemical weapons.
More long-term and arduous task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
We understand that it is about 1,000 tons.
Earlier Washington said that the days of Assad are considered.
I think Assad must leave.
The question is not whether occurs it, and in when it happens.
It is not legitimate anymore and should leave.
But Assad remains.
Also feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are separated and poorly armed.
Its people to flee their homes, many are starving.
Some should feed on the leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad avoided prosecution for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad impression of the individual ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother than that did not kill him using chemical weapons.
Assad remains so far.
Also changes the weapon for power.
Domich will work 240 hours for an extremist movie per social networks
The Lenin district court in Tomsk sentenced by 240 hours compulsory works of the resident who placed the video of an extremist nature on the social network, the representative of the press-service regional court told RIA-Novosti on Friday.
According to court, in March 2013, the man posted on the page on the popular social network video, which is registered in the federal list of extremist material.
On it criminal case in the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "The action aimed at the incitement of hatred and hostility, and to degrade a person made publicly" were made.
"The Lenin district court heard the case in a special order and found a man guilty of the above crime by imposing a sentence in the form of 240 hours of community service", the negotiator of the agency said.
She added that a man completely pleaded guilty.
The parents of intersex children could choose "uncertain sex"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor at the children born with external genitals of intermediate type.
The newborn will not necessarily attribute male or female any more.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender of these children, allowing parents to specify gender as "uncertain" or "unknown" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on exploitation on assignment of a floor by the newborn, and counter discrimination of intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I'm not a man and not a woman".
I will remain the patchwork product created by doctors with bruises and scars.
About one of two thousand children born each year is neither the boy nor the girl.
They have an interseksualnost, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of "breach of sexual development" — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovarian or testes) or unusually developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been interseksualy.
Gender identity remains poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that if the sex cannot be identified, better to use all available information and to give it than to wait and trace psychological and physical development of the child before the operation if at all, it will happen.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher who specializes in issues of gender identity, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea".
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have threatening violation lives that require surgery, but most children does not have them" — he said.
You can assign a floor without operation and then look as a person develops.
The science how at the child any gender identity will develop, is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why it happens.
It as a mystery about why people also being homosexual.
The report sent to the European commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender as their state is not concerned with gender, and their biological structure that does not meet only neither male nor female, and is typical of both at the same time, or is not specific to one of them.
These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, the breast and the constitution; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination, intersex and transgender people in employment, and about the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes because of prejudice face.
Boys with gender biases have a special camp now.
Australia and Nepal has already allow adults to put male, female or "the third floor" in the official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Norri Mai-Uelbi became the first person, recognized "asexual" by defended in court the right to save the "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, in the German passports third symbol in addition to M and F — X, that is intersex will be used.
In neighbouring France gender issues still be controversial, according to news release on the France 24 channel.
In 2011 dozens of lawmakers from France, this imposed Catholic country, signed a petition to seize "the gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we overturn two other pillars of civilization".
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that applied to children sex at birth.
"To raise the child relatively hard and without additional restrictions, particularly if you don't know the sex of the child" — she told the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia, called hermaphrodites — by name beautiful Greek god who wielded signs of both sexes.
And more than just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then back to draw.
But now many challenge the ethical foundations for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the floor assigned to it when grows.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called" an urgent psychiatric case "" — Drescher said.
When these children were born, you called not a psychiatrist — you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with mutilation of intermediate type, was proposed by Dr John Mani at Johns Hopkins University, who considered that gender is easily change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" into circulation and claimed that environment signals, including social — how parents raise the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones, defining, whether the person will consider himself as the man or the woman.
But in one case of 1966 known as "John/Joan", his theories had been called into question.
He advised the boy's parents, whose penis was injured during negligent circumcision, to fully gelding the child, having also deleted his testicles, and to raise it as a girl.
"Mani presented a case as a good example of transition, but it was not so" — Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he is again a boy and married a woman.
But in 38 years he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors still "apply this model".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations on a sex change announced themselves "unhappy with result".
That is was also Jim Bruce's case, the 36-year-old writer from the State of Montana, which was born with male chromosomes of XY but mutilation of intermediate type.
Doctors could not determine accurately whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis, and were confident that he will never be able to lead "fulfilling life" of the man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external genital and Bruce's testicles were surgically removed, and it was raised as a girl.
Began to give it female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I am not a girl" — he said ABCNews.com.
I was miserable, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In 18 years to it the vaginoplastika was appointed.
But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he required medical records.
What he learned was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give it to the body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of mutilation.
Having learned the truth, he is again a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing the chest.
Operation made it futile.
Today, he defended others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring into norm perception of people with an interseksualnost.
But Ann Temar-Mettis, executive director of the California law association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "tends to encourage the demonization and stigma".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child" uncertain sex "" — she said.
We fear that it will promote intervention.
We believe that it is better to appropriate male or female, and then wait.
But we have yet to see how this law, therefore, everything will prove that we can do — it to speculate.
Temar-Mettis said her organization supports the Australian law as "it allows adults to opt for the third floor".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a formal sex" — she says.
The German law means its request at birth.
This battle that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arleene Barats, the mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter in violation of sexual development and that helps hundreds of other people with the support group, said that the German law "will support" both parents and children.
The daughter Barats, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but it has a violation of sexual development under the name "syndrome full tolerance to androgens".
As its androgenic receptors not work properly, at Katie female signs developed.
He has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.
Now, in 29 years, Katie is married and studies internship in child psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions" — Barats said.
He gives them time to make some analyses and to understand the situation, as well as the period before they write "male" or "female".
In that case you as it should be — raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to make a transaction that is nonreversible hasty.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that moves parents because they don't feel they do well" — she said.
Ultimately, the child will decide with what floor to him or her is more comfortable — and it is remarkable.
It gives children the chance to make the decision independently.
US Secretary of State: intelligence services sometimes "gone too far" in data collection
The United States Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that in data collection and wiretaps American intelligence services sometimes "gone too far" nevertheless the politician noted that the information on the wiretap of 70 million people that appeared in the news media is not true.
I assure you that innocent people during this process does not tolerate, but an attempt to collect information was.

The experts of equestrian Action gathering in Cardiff to fight for the prize "Horse of the Year" knew that the competition will be very high.
But nobody was willing to three-year-old Fenton Kirkland's appearance.
Still not even a schoolboy, only a few months earlier, this kid who took the first steps with the pet a Shetland pony of Toffee at a trot flew through three rounds that are easy to take the first prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
The inseparable pair — identical growth — was commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest organized by the centre of equestrian sport Sannibenk in the city of Radri near Cardiff.
Having come to the public inspection against men and women in elegant hats pots, he shifted aslant the cap and is proud spent around 2-year-old Toffee.
Judges praised Fenton for him absolutely beyond the years developed innate ability of the treatment of horses.
And Toffee received the highest mark for the appearance and character.
To Fenton submitted to the Toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and since then, he was working with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffey make a wonderful duet".
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and the rozochka.
It was only its second performance with Toffee, and all of us were delighted when he won.
Total strangers in the arena considered it so phenomenal that wanted to be photographed with it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo that near Ebb-Vail in south Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who reveals horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "All public was struck, and all shouted cheers and clapped".
He ran in the sand on the entire length of the arena and although looked so tiny, perfectly made the case.
Fenton crazy about animals — it loves horses, tractors and farms, and it has two chickens of whom he cares.
How it began, soon, he will already participate in "the horse of the year" — and I'm sure he'll be good.
A representative of the annual horse exhibition said: "To Fenton only three years, but he knows how to treat a pony".
Together they excellent command.
Judges marked out Fenton and Toffey for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show ring.

The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice "to stop-and-search" in the New York police department
On Thursday the court of appeal of the federal district has suspended a court order requiring changes to stop-and-search programme of the New York police department and discharged a judge of business.
The court of appeal of the second Circuit of the US announced that the execution of the decisions of the judge Shira Sheyndlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution how it implemented a programme for street detention and interrogation.
The city filed an appeal to its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including an instruction to appoint a controller to help police station to alter its practices and related training programme.
On Thursday, the court of Appeal heard debate of the parties on the application for a business suspension.
The court of Appeal said the need to remove the judge because it violated the code of conduct for judges of the US and is not counted on the need to avoid bias demonstration, partly because of an interview series in the media and the official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably turning to black and Hispanic according to the stop-and-search program.
She appointed an external controller for oversight of large-scale changes that include reforms in area, the politician, of training and control, and decided to begin a pilot program to test the video cameras mounted on a body in those police stations where there is a majority of detention.
In August, New York came to the decision to discontinue the practice of storage of names and addresses of people, put on that were stopped after police checks.
The debate on the appeal of the city must take place after 14 March 2014.
Tactics "to stop and search" criticized by a great number of lawyers by the civil rights.
"Stop search" practice decades in one form or another, however, the number of documentary stops rose sharply at the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, having reached in 2011 an all-time record in 684 330 people, most of whom black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all and representatives of national minorities, sued the collective claim.
Supporters of changes in the stop-and-search programme in the New York police department say these changes will put an end to the unfair practice, would create a more reliable and efficient police service and could affect how other police departments realize this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce the morale of police officers, but not crime rates, will lead to unnecessary waste of money and will not solve more global problem of difficult circumstances in police because the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop practice "to stop-and-search" that corresponds to the constitution, but changes the way with what the New York police stops people.
Azarov promised to Ukrainians a collapse in prices for goods after the signing of association with the European Union
The prime minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that the prices in the country will were to fall dramatically after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said it during communications with readers of the page on "Facebook".
I can say definitely that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which is, including, and customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and entry into force of the statute of the Free trade zone, the level of tariffs on imports of goods from the EU would significantly reduced.
And it will mean, as prices should fall.
"It comes to goods that come from EU countries" - was written by Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be to such direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there too, there should not be a price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards, which appeared in our country has been quite a lot recently that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, not really true or if more accurately to speak - not at all so ", - Azarov summed up.
Rescue package of $325 million for healthcare in Tasmania
The federal government insists that the rescue package of $325 million for the weakened health of Tasmania will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend means for nothing.
The federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek said that the Commonwealth is "urgent action" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island nation, a higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.
The decision on funding for four years was made after consultation of the government with the independent member of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
"The government proposed a package of the emergency rescue, which we believe will address specific problems, facing staff" — Ms. Plibersek announced today.
The package of $325 million in size includes $31 million to blitz campaign to planned operations.
Further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, would help overcome backlog.
There is also money for the clinics receiving patients _without in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after a hospital, the training of medical experts, mental health services and introducing systems of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
"These investments will go on the ideas expressed by the best doctors realization how best to help health system of Tasmania" — Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in the regime of strict accountability and responsibility.
Staff will need to support the current funding levels to receive funds from the Commonwealth, and monthly to report on where it spends these additional resources.
The commission of three people will be created to make sure staff provides services as effectively as possible and is more effective.
Mr. Wilkie declared today that $325 million will solve nothing, "if they are not followed by original reform which will put health system of Tasmania on steadier basis".
Nevertheless, he praised the government to respond to its request for an urgent assistance with which he first turned to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the package of the federal help will promote considerably to a conclusion of health system of this staff from critical condition" — Mr. Wilkie told.
According to the state government, these additional electoral procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But the federal opposition representative on health Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is "a decision similar to the adhesive plaster".
"The reason why we are here, is that Labour state government pulled out $430 million from a health system" — he said ABC TV television companies.
When the state government tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million, it is impossible to pretend that it is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from a rescue package would not be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Cry of despair of a voter Obama
I voted for president Obama twice, sharing the hope for the possibility of change
He said that Obama allowed obstructionism of republicans to nullify commendable efforts.
The obstruction cannot excuse problems with the website of the health system reformed by Obama attacks of UAVs
Memories of the Obama campaign are of 2008 a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris — the second-year student of medicine at Harvard university.
I read terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me at the time of sadness at the second year of medical school and will allow me to have a sense of hope.
It is called "audacity to win" and these are memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.
When I stop writing reports on my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book returns me when the policy encouraged millions of people, and speeches could capture spirit.
The victory was impressive, and hosts of news programmes have pause for reflection of this historic moment.
My classmates wept with happiness, and my parents protected all newspapers that only they could find.
The young team of strategists had to come to the White house, and people were prepared to change.
In an effective date of Obama in the post in 2008, its level of support made 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is rude awakening as wrest from dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I lowered the first ballot, changes have been made.
It was that I could not even imagine.
I give Obama commended for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable health care to the conclusion of our military from Iraq, cancellation of the rule "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", Osama bin Laden's murder.
Indeed, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closing of the base in Guantánamo among others.
But after innumerable times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it before colleagues and peers, I finished the explanation that I can provide.
I reached a point of political despair.
The obstruction of republicans cannot explain leave to wiretap of foreign leaders or the strike of UAVs on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain data collection on privacy of Americans by the National security agency or persecution of the debunkers opening illegal actions of the government.
He could not explain the deaths of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki out of court or non-compliance with limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that the efforts used by the White house to silence the media, are "the most aggressive … since the Nixon administration".
And recently it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know whether it to me to be expected.
Whether I had to understand at the age of 18 years, what the management can contradict political campaigns which precede it?
It is clear that the work of elective office is not a predictable programme of action as our public dialogue will be formed by opposition political party and such random events as massacre in Newtown.
Nevertheless by all examples which are listed above by me it is visible that they substantially were own choice of administration.
And it what bothers me most.
I once again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney submitted incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed as if he is unable to decide on their own policies or views.
I believed that in the second time Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, will meet the expectations that we have heard in such a long time.
However, this week when Obama's ratings have dipped below 45%, it has become much harder to come back in 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for the many commitments have disappeared.
This week, I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton retreat in Obama resounding defeat in primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting, according to an analysis of the reasons for non-implementation it has told staff that they should return to normal and remain loyal to the end.
"I wish that we return our call — he said.
— We must remember who we are ".
Five years have passed, Mr. president, and I absolutely agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this commentary belong only to Nathaniel Morris.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president took the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath, but the date of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of political struggle in Egypt.
The ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised "new Egypt" when took the oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
On the inauguration before the Supreme constitutional court of Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the courthouse on the banks of the Nile built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, new Egypt and the second republic" — Morsi during a ceremony which is broadcast live on state television said.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability" — Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from "Muslim Brotherhood", fundamentalist group, which the majority of 84 years of its existence was a proscribed organisation serving as a target for tough action of successive governments said.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small train soon after the 11th morning local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential hydor times of Mubarak, the movement was halted for only a short time to move his convoy in the usually lively road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi derided as not charismatic "spare wheel" of "Brothers", his personal prestige shot up from the moment of his victory and Friday statement in which he tried to present itself (himself) as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to finish this uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state" — Morsi wearing a blue suit case with a red tie, to judges in the room lined with wooden panels, where he took the oath said.
After Morsi went to Cairo university, where he had to deliver his inaugural speech.
An official reception with the army orchestra which fulfilled the national anthem during which he stood at attention "quietly" was extended to it.
There was a military figure field marshal Hussein Tantawi.
Its arrival was met by the slogan "Army and the People — One Hand" which was chanted by hundreds of audience in the main lecture hall of university.
The founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo university in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamic student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that completed authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year arose and promised to return the powers of the president of which his position was denied by the Council of War, which accepted cases from the deposed leader.
But having agreed to take the oath of office before the courts, but not before parliament as it is adopted, it carries out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools designed to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses of English literature would require that students studied at least one play by Shakespeare, the novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914.
At examination "extracurricular texts" will also be presented to encourage more extensive reading.
The integrated course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be obliged to move individual final examination in the language, with emphatic recommendations of the choice of English literature as separate examination.
The Department of Education has to issue new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow — to the first themes subjected to radical revision.
He will make changes to other major themes next year.
Separately, the regulator in the area of examinations of OFQUAL will submit a revised structure of final exams of high school, with new evaluation system and smaller volume of term papers.
Acting in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gouv told that "the broad consensus that we have to reform our system of examinations was reached to return public trust", insisting that school final examinations will be "more difficult, more ambitious and more strict".
Studies show that English schools spend less time for mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during the quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison — Australian schools give on average 143 hours a year, and in Singapore students enrolled nearly 138 hours.
Though formal requirement will not find more time in the schedule for mathematics, sources in the coalition were told that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics in combination with the increased coefficient in the table of ratings, will serve most likely as incentive for providing additional training by schools in this subject.
In the curriculum more attention will be paid to "tasks from real life", including financial mathematics.
Football - discord reason?
In the State Duma in "An open rostrum" policies and experts said about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals also such were delivered: prohibit football in the North Caucasus, because from that game - one scandals and strife.
The speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled about recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to decrease "tensions degree in society" politicians and media must be correct in statements.
Perhaps he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the shows, threatened to surround the Caucasus, with barbed wire if you don't want to limit birth rates...
All speakers said and the measures for the management of migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize the relationship between the peoples of Russia that gave discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev - "the model conflict that could be predicted" but "at us is responsible for these issues too many people and organs" and too many cooks spoil the broth.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long against migrants were practised by Europe, according to the public man, failed, and we should look for the way.
The historian Yuri Petrov heightened expectations of a new single textbook of history.
"Still it is necessary to create a manual on cultural history of the people of the country that schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan and vice versa", he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to criminalize "calls to dismember Russia": "If the US to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and will provide 20 years of prison! "
Vladimir Zhirinovsky has struggled "not to incite".
As usual, he accused journalists who submit painful and compelling national problems for public discussion of everything: "In the midst of controversy you never know, you can tell you! "
The leader of United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev right there advised journalists to conclude "charter" and to agree to engage in talk about it clearly, and then the same obligations can also assume politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is installed, Mr. Vasiliev said.
It gave the law that gives on regional and municipal authorities responsible for international Peace in their territory as an example.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for the act: in it there is no "clear ideas that such adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms, and limits.
Funds, themes will treated differently the volume of these powers.
In addition municipalities have no staff needed to address these complex issues, there are no funds, and the centre does not provide policy advice that they could use to them...
The head of the State Duma's Committee on Nationalities Gadzhimet safaraliev invited to create special department with the terrible name "Department of Homeland Security" that would deal with national policy.
But Valery tishkov, in the 1990s headed the same department subsequently abolished opposed.
It is enough to have at the federal level of the special person, "the minister without portfolio" to which it would be possible to contact if that.
"We are on the razor-edge, shells are torn by a row, very important to representatives of different ethnicities and religions together to oppose provocation, and the work was to get decent information support" - the representative of ROC on links with society Vsevolod Chaplin said.
Any neutrality of the state to dangerous ideologies, religious including to be, in his view, should not.
Here Oleg Nilov took discussion to the unexpected course: "More talented people than in Chechnya and Dagestan, it remains to be seen, but they are pushed not that way, not on that road", he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "That the footballer was beaten all the crowd, flags burn, comrades throw stones of each other...
Maybe we don't need such football?
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"Equal it will not be in the world in this sport! "is a member of A Just Russia warmly said.
In the Caucasus nobody will play rugby! - right there Mr. Zhirinovsky interfered.
You still offer curling to them!
It is necessary to know national characteristics, all the same as "Zaporozhets" to offer it to the Georgian "...
In Yaroslavl on the stands representatives of the Moscow club - have distinguished themselves in wild behaviour during the game with local club.
Football should be banned across the country...
Confessions of National security agency strengthen paranoia of corporations to the state surveillance
In the warm afternoon at the end of August, the helicopter of the German police flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
Under the instruction of Federal service for the protection of the constitution (bfvs), maintenance of internal intelligence of Germany, his task was to photograph the rooftop of representation of the US, which is less than 5 km from the European central bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that bfvs hoped to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions caused negotiations between the US and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Klepper, director of National intelligence of the US, in September, reassured that the US do not use the foreign intelligence "for the theft of trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden — the contract employee who was the unmasker — started publishing a treasury of secrets of the intelligence of the United States, European governments and business leaders are not sure any more, if he can take the director, the word.
Reports about the National Security agency of the US monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in cloud service providers of the US including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by surveillance of the state to new heights.
News that the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel was heard, perhaps about 10 years is the last straw.
If the most powerful man of Europe can become a target, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the United States and companies.
I think it is likely that these data are used to mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up" — Oliver Gryun, president of the association BITMi, which is small and medium IT companies in Germany says.
German companies are confident that the US now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency Eee.
In all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, there was no evidence that the US transferred trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU is not enough some opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce their dependence on the US.
Entrepreneurs are skeptical.
Someone in the German parliament said that we must create the German Google.
I can only close your eyes and slowly open them again …
"This is not an option" — Gasso Plattner, president of the German company software vendor for business of SAP says.
If there is a need for powerful European IT industry, you shouldn't let it must been lost more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
And yet the scope and technical development of agencies on espionage of the US became renowned for Snowden's revelations were shock for some companies that used to think the biggest risk of surveillance is China.
Big shift occurs in the cloud where heads of the European companies sold better that the data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction, and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-US participants dropped plans to use services of the cloud provider, who is in the US after the exposure of the American programme for the intellectual analysis of data of Prism.
Jim Sneyb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We see that consumers ask a new issue that did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they physically will remain in that jurisdiction ".
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports — it only confirm that they already knew that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets, and, therefore, these data should be protected at all costs.
That there is an economic espionage — not surprising.
It always took place.
"It was the subject of discussion, many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy" — Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF said.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, and we also spy on them as it is in our national interests — to protect our businesses.
Leaders of corporations usually don't like to boast of those responses which they pledged as it can provide dignity to the enemy.
In large companies, the thought that to take a free flash card at an exhibition or to leave your laptop without supervision in a hotel basement, it at least unwisely was acquired for a long time.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a board member of the Audi carmaker, said that many years, it is standard practice - to collect mobile phones before council meetings that they could not be used as taps.
The federal Protective service of the German constitution recommends that the heads of companies to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones jump out later.
Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in a particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized firms often do not have experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access" — cautions in the report of bfvs.
The US warn their own companies on economic espionage from other countries.
The national Intelligence U.S. report in February placed France, together with Russia and Israel in the second row of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, endorses The Washington Post.
A board member of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are most worse".
Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French agency of an internal investigation into the DCRI reportedly said in an interview this month: "Services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on allies".
The Los Angeles international airport was evacuated because of the shooting in one of terminals.

According to preliminary data, the man had fired from a rifle of high power.
Some people, including a member of the Transportation Security Administration of the US, were wounded.

He was lightly wounded.
Tripodi denies that is subject to Obeid's influence
The former minister of the work of the New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the person involved in the investigation of anti-corruption supervisory authority of the staff.
The former minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refutes modify the order of the lease primorskiy objects at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who was secretly owning shares in three real estate on state-owned land.
The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended the ​ ​ investigate whether Mr. Obeid at several ministers of staff lobbied extension leases for Serkyyular Ki, where the family Obeydov owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing of the tender after the expiry of their action in August 2005.
It investigated claims now that Mr. Tripodi knew about clandestine involvement of Mr. Obeid in real estate, after the testimony given by a former deputy head of the administration of Mr. Tripodi Lynn Eshpoul on Thursday.
For several years of the discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease was set to open competition.
Tenants were against it, and also wanted longer periods of rent.
In 2009 leases for businesses on Serkyyular Ki, which brought to the family Obeydov about $2.5 million a year, were extended without exposure to open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the minister for infrastructure and transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported open competitions.
But he denied that changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid who, as Mr. Tripodi recognized, strongly advised to make changes to lease government policy.
Talk in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the ministry of ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the department of Fisheries was given in the interpretation of telephone conversations presented to ICAC.
"If there was the issue discussed during the telephone conversations, the question of policy development of commercial rent? "— Assistant commissioner Anthony Wylie of Mr. Tripodi asked.
"no" — Mr. Tripodi replied. —
I cannot remember that was discussed, but it was certain not that.
Definitely not between myself and Mr. Obaid.

Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh region duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area, the abuse bound by that, in its 98th year shareholders same acquired, and in the 2000s, the same shareholders too began. "
People started to earn money on it to cover the hole, including, adopted the two laws.
Near Voronezh you decide to build a holding centre for foreign nationals who are subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such law not only under pressure of the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region, although take away.
So, last year on the migratory account became a little more than 100,000 foreigners.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes - a big issue.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh region duma, said: "They violated the law, but are not criminals. "

The centers for Disease control and prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the centers for Disease control and prevention published a list of recommendations for control of food allergies in children in schools.
It is the first list of similar recommendations, which was issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies grows.
Now one of 20 children in the US has food allergies.
The centers for Disease control and prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The office provides information for schools how to raise awareness of teachers and the service personnel on food allergies in children and how to assist in the case of having an allergic reaction.
It also encourages schools to hold adrenaline reserves — most often for injection automatic medical syringe of EpiPen — for assistance is used in potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures made changes to regulations recently to allow schools to do adrenaline reserves with less hassle.

Children can say: "It feels as though something pokes on my tongue", "the feeling that is always on the lips of me hair" or "language pinches".
The Kenyan press is appalled by the provocative media law
"This terrible place, is also the reason for the question: what may prevent destruction of judicial independence by Parliament in the future? "— the newspaper reported, calling the law is unconstitutional.
"The law very harsh and punitive, and we reject it" — Cyrus Kamau, the managing director of Capital Group - the parent company CapitalFM into which one of the independent radio stations that are most respected in Kenya and the news site enters said.
He said the new judicial authority on media "will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising will do much harm to the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to deputies" — he told.
According to the The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government "to take media stranglehold" and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen the national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the mall Westgate.
Kenyan media drew the wrath of authorities, broadcast of surveillance cameras, where troops were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly looting expensive shopping centre.
The call of the two journalists and an official of the media on interrogation, although the call was cancelled after mass protests of the media was the response of the chief Constable David Kimayo.
Under the new law of the publishing house can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists — to one million with additional risk to be "delisted", that is to receive a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the penalty was not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "one has only one penalty to paralyse the majority of FM radio stations".
She also reported that these measures can have devastating effect on the so-called "a lively blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that, with the media silent, they will be able to do whatever they will take in head, with impunity.
"Nobody ever learns" — journalist of Nation Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and will return us to hunting and gathering" — he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the reductions appointed by the national commission on salaries and restore the size of the huge salary, component of 532 thousand shillings a month, which are not assessed by taxes — one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check the mistreatment of the child in Biysk

After the prosecution of Eugene Vasiliev's bad taste spoke
Yevgenia Vasilyeva on which person almost a year, the media attention is focused, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both on theft in the Ministry of Defence, and about him personally - the relationship with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, his poetry and about addiction to valuables.
However, on 1 November, the person involved in the business of "Oboronservis" violated silence.
Said in an interview of Life News of Vasiliev: "Initially, of course, the task was made just one: to pull out of me any negative information concerning the former Defence Minister ".
There was a blackmail in what I have to testify, otherwise I would go to jail.
Today these threats stopped.
Next, we go to court, we will prove his innocence.
We are confident of victory for 100 per cent.
Thus from interview it is possible to draw a conclusion that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyeva was touched by words that at her is unimportant with taste.
Perhaps the statement by the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in a collection of paintings, which was collected by the person involved in the business of "Oboronservis", forgery, were found means.
Among the seized property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in the deep knowledge of art, got as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after the arrest of these pictures found that they have no artistic value and, quite simply, are cheap imitation ", - Markin in early October noted.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then, after all admitted that they from the Ministry of Defence are not stolen, and said to me it is bad with the taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just a lawlessness "- says vasiljeva.
In response to the question as to whether she would plead guilty while one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to it, Vasiliev said: "Naturally, no.
There is nothing to recognize in general.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
Simply mislead the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the RF IC that vasiljeva refrained from dealing with the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer for the person involved announced that he and his client "the investigator made it impossible to get acquainted with the case file".
What served as a reason to revelations by vasiljeva who is under house arrest, who was still not communicating with the press?
It is possible how the woman she could not but respond to the charge of bad taste?
Or the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda claiming a couple of days ago are right, what it "fell even further into trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family fold?
The famous military observer of "KP" Viktor Baranets in the article "Serdyukov returned to the wife? "wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock it may become more talkative during interrogations".
Before Vasiliev assumed some allegations of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defence.
The defender of "Juventus" Leonardo Bonuchchi will not help the team with the closest match of the championship of Italy with "Parma".
As reports Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include it in the demand for the game to save before the match of the 4th round of a group round of the Champions League with "Real".
Also Lichtsteiner, vu Ini and Pepe will not participate in a duel with "Parma".
And the forward Fabio Quallarella was restored after an injury and is ready to play.
The British government said the study aimed at improving economic force for Scotland of the project of the railway line HS2.
The HS2 project involves opening of the high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, from the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport baroness Kramer noted that the project "will combine Great Britain".
The Minister of Transport Scotland Keith Brown said that it works on the plan, "delighted" with perspective, with the British government.
The first phase will be in the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second phase was completed, the lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and the North of England from £32.7 to £Cr $42.6 billion.
The British government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, entrusted to HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements the capacity of railway and reduce the length of travel to Northern England and Scotland.
It must include the ability to overcome the way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal on HS2 is to create relatively national network that will make Great Britain and its cities is closer to each other".
We are developing HS2 because benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it we will face crisis of capacity in our rail system.
But the speech also goes on transport communications of cities with each other; Across the UK 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement — good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish government Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network "clearly".
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railway across the UK".
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the establishment of benefit for all and the continuation of the railway line Glasgow — Edinburgh which are already planning the Scottish government.
I look forward to the consideration of the research results with British ministers next year and joint decision of the next steps.

Owners of grocery stores across America worry that cuts would reduce costs to consumers.
Members of Congress continue to debate how to reduce the financing of the government even more.

Sony looks forward to lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics maker, Sony corporation, having completed last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
The results of Sony from July to September 2013 were starker than expected, associated with a decline in demand for TVs, cameras and personal computers of production of Japanese corporation.
The television business of Sony, which in the second quarter brought to the company operating profit, the first for three years, of 5.2 billion yen falling again in the reporting period to 9.3 billion yen operating loss.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics goes through difficult times, especially because of lower demand for televisions.
And while competitors strive to look to exit the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals to Sony, Panasonic corporation, collapses emphases on industrial supplies recently: here the company's sales grow rapidly, particularly at the expense of automotive systems and clean technology.
As a result, by the end of fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to acquire 179 billion yen operating profit against 230 billion yen expected earlier.
Thus, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts suggested that this figure will be much higher and will make 221 billion yen.
Seeking to leave crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month start for the sale of "smart" hours from Japanese corporation highlighted with a number of fashionable functions that would get rid of the need to 100 times a day to get a smartphone with a pocket was announced.
After Sony reduced its annual forecast for profit and revenue, shares of the company at the opening of torog in Tokyo lost in the morning in price more than 11%, falling to the level of 1668 yen for one event.
How many earn the late celebrities from MK in the U.S. MK
The rating of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna who earned 125 million.
But it was "surpassed" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013, of 160 million.
Radically different died celebrities, which last year "earned" several times less lag behind it.
Elvis Presley - 55 million in the year was the second in the list of the most "wealthy" left celebrities made by Forbes magazine as a result of the year, and the line, the author of comics Peanuts Charles Schulz from 37 million below.

The Social Revolutionary proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings towards extremism
For legal protection of patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults directed against Russia "Just Russia" proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings towards extremist activities and to punish him five years in prison.
As the Izvestia newspaper such amendments to legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the State Duma's Energy Committee Oleg Mikheyev reports, have already been sent for a conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand emotional connection of the man with the country, is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, the responsible attitude to his fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev indicated, in the domestic law there are penalties for violations of formal signs of the government - the flag and the coat of arms.
Thus, according to a parliamentarian, protection of Russians who feelings can be hurt by a show of both an affront to the state symbols, and other forms of contempt for our country, in the Russian legislation is worked enough.
It provides the discussions that are developed annually on the eve of the Victory Day when some media-persons *dare* call into question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists as an example.
On the eve of the main public holiday - the Victory Day on May 9 - a real orgy is annually developed.
Professing in wit and "an alternative view" of history, some publicists reach reasoning that, say, what a pity that cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I think it is totally unacceptable in a country where pride of history, remained the main "spiritual cement of to" the nation ", Oleg Mikheyev is indignant.
In addition, according to Mikheev, it is much more patriotic people in Russia than religious, but however, the act recompenses for insulting feelings of believers, and you can offend patriotic feelings with near impunity.
According to the people's deputy, it is necessary to equate insulting patriotic feelings towards extremist activities and to make the appropriate punishment in the 282nd article of the Criminal code.
The bill punishes insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100-thousand penalty five - to the summer output.
The impact of jailers will increase in new structures of public monitoring commissions
Today the council of the Public Chamber (CC) may approve new structures of the public monitoring commissions (PMC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote was adopted, lobbyists of security officers will increase its influence.
PMC - the social structures controlling detention centres.
Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhayev's affairs, unrest in a Kopeisk colony - through KIO become known most high-profile incidents behind bars.
To control KIO there is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists security officers.
At a meeting of the OP Workgroup on forming the KIO I offered to make a selection criterion experience of human rights activities.
"It was not accepted, and emerging lists, without having developed criteria", Valery borschev says.
Borschev - the current chairman of the Moscow supervisory commission and the Association of independent observers - the All-Russian structure of the human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
In the suspension by State Duma deputy from "Apple" he developed the law governing KIO.
The Council of OP should vote for structures of KIO in 43 parts of the country.
Less than one thousand people interested claim to 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not organize because of the absence of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donabor on vacancies.
PMC of Moscow - one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new structure instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to borschev, in the current capital structure commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security officers, and in the version that is on a vote in OP, the ratio changes on 17 to 23.
With 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the capital commission.
But the representative of "A combat brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin may again be a new part.
He was three years a member of the KIO, but never visited prisoners.
Borschev believes that security officers by appointing the chairman of the KIO, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable so human rights defenders do not kick a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, promotion of security officers is coordinated by a member of the KIO Anton Tsvetkov title "Officers of Russia" - the advocacy organization for security forces.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast", said RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.
It denies that lobbies the promotion of any lists and said it was not going to interfere with defenders to visit the arrested opponents.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested, for which list now vote in OP.
He believes publication of information by borschev as pressure form.
The likely success of human rights activists - the planned changes in the leadership of the Chelyabinsk KIO.
Her former managers will be discharged because of last year's Kopeisk unrest.
In the public chamber concluded that the office of the local commission ignored problems of prisoners.
And here the KIO of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security officers.

Borschev believes the lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions as "as revenge for Kopeysk".
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's revelations did not affect KIO of Mordovia, which believe "power": only one human rights activist wanted to get to the new structure, and at her did not even accept documents for competition.
The member of council of OP Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that voted against the offered list as he is revolted by a situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
It sent out a position to other council members.
His colleague on OP Paul Gusev said she voted for as it likes the proposed Moscow list.
The deputy secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of FSIN training institute agreed drawing up lists of KIO.
Grib told RBC daily that does not consider how to divide candidates for human rights defenders and security officers and did not agree that at the chairmen of the commissions is sufficient powers to interfere with the work of its members.
Grib does not undertake to predict the outcome of a vote of the council of OP.
If the proposed list was rejected today, in the next few days for a vote will present the amended version.

The oenb blames "an internal error" but not hackers to stopping the site
The National security agency shrouded in secret declared on Friday evening that termination of work of their site at some o'clock was caused by technical failure, but not hackers as it was approved in a network.
"NSA.gov was unaccessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during scheduled update" — reported intelligence agency in the official e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
Allegations that interruption in work was due to a distributed denial-of-service attack like "denial of service" [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening online monitoring systems servers recorded that the site of the NSA did not work at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, the representative of the NSA reported ABC News that the internal confidential agency's network "not at all" been compromised.
No secret information exists in danger, the official said.
At least one online group of hackers defenders said that it is responsible for disabling of the site of the NSA using DDoS-attack.
DDoS-attacks are designed to sweep the target site traffic, while servers are not be overloaded and the site does not fail.
Tactics of hackers is relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of target system.
Earlier top-secret NSA which once received a nickname "There Is No Such Agency" became a focus of public attention and fierce criticism after series of revelations about his vast programme of surveillance abroad and within the country in recent months — all this response to the confidential files the oenb stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former official of the NSA Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around agency caused rumours that today's incident was the result of deliberate action of hackers.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
"There was a milestone today: The construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe began "— chairman of Gazprom Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security of all European continent.
South Stream is intended to diversify export routes of Russia through Europe.
The dispute under the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which there is a majority of the gas of Russia destined for Europe, increases the risk level for normal routes, officials said.
Miller said that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated "forever".
The Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at cut-rate prices as soon as in 2015 the entire project starts work.
Gazprom announced that construction should start in other countries farther along the pipeline route, by the end of the year.
Annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Rosbalt agency deprived of the status of the media to verbal abuse
On 31 October, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the licence to register Rosbalt agency - "Tape" writes.
Drew Roscomnadzor on deprivation of the agency of the status of media - for the systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process unpleasant precedent has been created: the court said that it was possible to close the media, in fact had refused to the publication the right to nominate counter-reply.
What is "Rosbalt"
JSC Rosbalt News Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the coming years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Also submissions to the countries of the former USSR work for the agency.
Since 2001 "Rosbalt" develop and operate as federal information and analysis agency.
By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
Thus "Rosbalt" always busy quite specific niche: notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies have been the centre of exclusive publications of the agency (and make still).
Talk about the proximity of the publication to power continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with that "Rosbalt" had extensive base of sources in various departments, such assumptions were spoken well also with that the project Natalya was at the head of Chaplin - Victor Cherkesov's wife.
Thus Chaplina's role in the office of "Rosbalt" is not fully clear: most often it is called "project manager".
The director general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently "Rosbalt" did not appear in the ratings of federal media - either on the quoting nor on the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the top in attendance at sites of the Russian media under LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500,000 viewings), monthly - up to three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the past five months - a note on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the singer of King and Clown group, pogroms in capital Biryulev.
The conflict of "Rosbalt" to Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law that banned journalists obscene abuse came into force.
Department found the forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the site of agency ("The Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "The Pussy Riot was profaned by oil derricks").
The parties have further describe differently.
Roscomnadzor on the basis of the found videos accused "Rosbalt" gross and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action to select the licence at the agency.
In "Rosbalt" said that claims of the division are illegal: first, clips were not editorials, secondly, obscene words in them were masked, and, thirdly, right after a warning clips were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in world court - and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints continued.
But already the 25th the magistrate decided not in favour of "Rosbalt": editor-in-chief - Alexander savelyev had been found guilty of breaching the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles, per 10,000 for each movie.
Obviously, it also determined the hearing outcome in Moscow City Court - if you give up the idea that the outcome could be prejudged even earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to reverse the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt" while effectively deprived agency of the status of the media.
It is impossible to say that "Rosbalt" during this opposition remained alone.
The agency was supported by members of the State Duma (the petition to the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of the CPRF).
The illegality of closure of the publication was announced by the head of the Russian Union of journalists Abhisit Vejjajiva, chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Paul Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on human rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Office of Roscomnadzor even provided it some assurance that business will not reach licence revocation.
The trial of "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction, it is safer to be to media in Russia today - a big issue.
The gene for a speech proved to be a catalyst for formation of synapses
Scientists from the Johns Hopkins University and Medical school Maunt-Sinai found protein through which "the speech gene" Foxp2 has out the function, encouraging the development of new links between neurons.
Study is published in Science, on the site of the loggingyou can read the summary.
The gene of Foxp2 is the first known gene that function is directly related to the speech.
It was possible to establish its role in 2001, thanks to the discovery of the family from several people who could not say correctly the word and sometimes even didn't understand each other.
Scientists found that at family members in the gene of Foxp2, but was broken how it is performing the function, remained unknown.
In the new study biologists showed that at least part of the Foxp2 functions exercises as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the brain, speech associated with formation.
Exercise it it thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found in a search of the factors that stimulate the production of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes found authors, with only on its activities viyat Foxp2.
That SRPX2 really affect actual call or vocalizations, scientists confirmed in an experiment to little mice.
When in animals activities of the gene was artificially reduced, they yelled at unit with mother less.
If the activity of the gene was restored, also the frequency of the made sounds was restored.
Earlier on mice communication with the actual call or vocalizations of Foxp2 was also shown.
Animals who entered the human copy of the gene, arquebuse are more active and at a lower rate than ordinary mice.
Still, however, scientists do not know whether the work of the Foxp2 and, accordingly, SRPX2 operated by it is associated with a purely "mechanical" properties of formation of sounds or thinner processes.

Want the ice cream shining in the dark?
A British businessman created the world's first ice cream shining in the dark using the Medusa.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the sea beast to develop a shining food.
He came to this idea, having read the scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced researchers in China chemically to recreate the shining protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, making the pH in protein and forcing him to shine.
Chris says that as ice cream starts shining when reacts to heat of a mouth, it means that the more you lick, the it becomes brighter.
Charlie, founder of the company to manufacture Lick Me, I Tasty ice cream, says: "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning if you talk about products, so you get approximately 2 g of substance at £200".
The protein, which we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH conditions.
So when your mouth warms protein, it will increase the pH and ice cream will start glow.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to submit it to the Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that I did because the glow of Medusa is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball cost me to be approx £140.
But it quite tastes good.
The experimental company of Charlie located in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop invisible ice cream".
It is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals of that ice cream is, but I think we will find a way to do so.
Ice cream uses the fluorescence of Medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists

The relationship between the US and Germany became strained after allegations that the NSA listened to the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group oversight intelligence service said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "safely and without destroying the relation with the US completely", it should be used.
Mr. Shtryobele, the MP for the Green Party of Germany, published a photograph with Mr. Snowden in the Twitter.
During a visit to Russia, it was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Shtryobele said, according to a lawyer for the former contractor of the National Security Agency, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if it left.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be "in security there", the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in a letter that he faced "rigid and permanent" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave the house.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to "his political statements".
Citizens around the world, and senior officials — including in the United States — considered exposure of uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter contained a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, "when difficulties this humanitarian situation will be solved".

The EU prepares support measures of Ukraine in the event of the economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to Ukraine's gas supplies, and to reach agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to potential signing of the association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
With the IMF negotiations on stand-by credit are under way, and other EU official who is directly involved in negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement soon.
Thus except the potential credit from the IMF Ukraine may receive 610 million euros from the European Union.
Analysts, respondents Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome old differences on financing terms.
Does not believe in the possibility of the reforms necessary to assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine on one step "B -" with "In".
However, representatives of the EU say that the IMF can be flexible in credit conditions, in view of the circumstances of Ukraine.
Except the plan of financial support of the country, the EU has a reserve option for Ukraine's gas supplies that vast majority of supply now comes from Russia.
It may be gas from Nord Stream or a negotiable from Slovakia.
The last, according to officials, is the best possible and appropriate way if Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this kind of reverse supplies to Ukraine can only be used for several weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in the transfer to other regions.
"Between EU countries and Ukrainians discussions on how to create an enabling environment that Ukraine could import gas from other sources, but not from Russia, or from the same source, but along other routes are held" - the Reuters the source added.

The Italian workers with an experience give way to the young
The Italian unemployment breaks records.
Data published on Wednesday showed that without the work now 12.5% of residents of the country.
So poorly cases were not since World War II.
Among young this indicator is many times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 have no employment.
By sight, the Italian authorities, one of the outcome of this problem - early retirement of older workers.
Such ekperiment have already been undertaken by the largest energy company of the country, and the laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of early retirement for workers with an experience.

Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all declared facilities for the production of chemical weapons, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons recognized.
This first phase of disarmament completed Damascus a day before the deadline.
Before November 1 Syria had to destroy the production and other ancillary facilities intended for the preparation of chemical warfare agents to use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of stockpiles of chemical agents or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, now toxic agents are in a sealed vaults.
International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, during a chemical attack died, according to the US, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of inspectors were not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to do more chemical weapons - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment of ammunition.
Will now carefully monitor these receptacles to prevent their repair.
The next milestone - the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians have to agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of chemical agents.
There is a lot of questions.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will provide to that end, the equipment?
All Syrian statements would be scrutinised by western intelligence services.
They are willing to advise the inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully candid.
The US believe that this attack was carried out by active armed forces.
Syria and Russia insist that the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - according to the agreement brokered by Russia to destroy or make into an unusable state all production facilities shells, poison gas and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage is passed, the destruction of chemical weapons, which is already available for the Syrian army must be the next step.
It is anticipated that in this arsenal there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve toxic agents, skin and blister mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
It is necessary for its destruction that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to begin agreed to a timetable for action - on it two weeks are taken away.
The head of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith said the BBC that his inspectors "personally oversaw the destruction of equipment".
"They don't have the possibility of the message continued production, or a mixture of chemical weapons are now", he said.
In a statement of the OPCW stated that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that plants producing shells and toxic agents were either destroyed or are put out of commission.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out there inspection, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by professionals of the OPCW.
According to Smith, the destruction of infrastructure on the production of chemical weapons "was particularly challenging" as it was necessary to work in conditions of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, time to celebrate it at the inspectors had not yet - they were too employed.
George kerewan: the gap with Europe gives Scots selection
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
The turn of stories about the passport control in Bervike and the border with barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall comes.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits from freer movements over the other Europe, although. then is predictable — it did not appear in headlines.
Nor did not indicate that EU Member States spend a lot of time to make the formal rules as it suits them.
As Scotland is not currently included to the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what she really wanted from Scots.
So it is a story that is not merit attention.
And such old that it has become a fossil: for the first time I heard "duck" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting point lost when retelling the ancient fairy tale.
Why, in general, independent Scotland should carry out the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stopped.
With eurocrisis the Europe project is officially dead.
In all European Union, the parties opposed to the EU or to cancel the euro as the single currency growth momentum.
Even in Germany, the party of the F-word "Alternative for Germany" — established only in this the year - coming from nowhere and received almost five million votes on September federal election, and in fact displacing "the Free democrats" (analog of ours of "the Liberal democrats") from the Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan to establish federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European central bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through maintaining the single currency led many people to believe that the European project gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments work at excessive budget deficits — it was only fair in Greece.
In fact, the eurosystem blocked the members on the exchange rates enabling German exporters. then German politicians and want to save.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency Southern Europe appears in before disadvantage on manufacturing capabilities compared with Germany.
The only the remedy is — to cut salaries and public spending that is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and monetary there is a deeper problem of productive abilities of Europe.
As a result of a package of measures on "green" energy, imposed by Brussels - code meaning subsidies of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry drew double for electricity four times more for gas than in the US.
It paralizuyushche adverse price terms as we saw in Greyndzhmuta.
No freezing salaries in the world will stop the crushing defeat of cheap shale gas of the US over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result was brewing rebellion, particularly in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris, as in means of obtaining political legitimacy anymore, and has already imposed its own economic policies to Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in distress.
Result floor-right, speaking against the EU Marine Le Pen's party "National front" just won a crucial by-election, releasing the ruling party of the Socialists to third place.
"Front" is the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes now — a timely warning to British labourists that it cannot be assumed that splits in the right will automatically affect in favour of the left.
What Le Pen with the newfound popularity among the French white working class does?
She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create the block in the European parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If. and it is very likely — parties opposed to the EU will receive support in these elections, such block will be able to reach for the first time a dominant position in the European parliament.
Here's my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something vague "Europe (sovereign) nations" that was encouraging to General de Gaulle.
Germany and some economies, dependent on it, can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is removed from the project, hoping to approach with the US.
Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates probable that Britain will go unnoticed by the cold Atlantic.
In that situation, it leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become the region (in fact) to Small England.
Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, in addition, to send Berlin and Brussels to devils.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed for more free European location, provided that we will keep the currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeat the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish national Party in Scotland are — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to the cuts in spending proposed (and implemented) the Labour chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Tories and liberal democrats that had arisen thereafter.
It would now be ridiculous to Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
The Australian woman files an appeal against the prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days in prison on the Phuket island for a false statement that it was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally found on 15 June by Phuket provincial court guilty of filing false claim after a message of Thai police that the local taxi driver carried out an attack on the night of Sunday June 10, while two other men held it.
However, on CCTV footage it later became clear that it safely returned to the hotel after the end of the relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before being admitted that fabricated the story.
To the court she was imprisoned in the local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days prison term in a detention centre for prisoners of the general regime on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in women's prison for adults.
It is the daughter of former player of the Australian league Peter Tanks who asked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that all family "was extremely concerned" by wellbeing of the daughter and waited for it return to Australia.
"It is clear that it was worrying time, but we hope that she would safely return home as soon as possible" — said Tanks.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, at present it is spending the holidays in the resort area Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is a local lawyer in Phuket now, but warned that the appeal may lead to the court will increase his sentence for up to two years and will force him to serve their sentence in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket Thailand may also seek to restore the eroded tourism image that will lead to the imposition of an acquittal.

Early puberty: Ageing earlier
African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers, show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms of early puberty
The trend towards early sexual maturity is not so expressed at boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge — a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Whether the mother should be scared if her daughter vestiges of the mammary gland start emerge and raise pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics this week to Orlando, Florida, the children's endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
"I spend much time, soothing parents - typically, this does not mean rapid approach of a full sexual maturity" — Kaplovitts said.
Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor appear at girls before.
But there was only a slight shift under the age of menarche (the first periods) in the past four decades.
In the United States middle age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breast starting to mature, passes at least two to three years at menarche" — Kaplovitts, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls said: how to cope with this widespread problem ".
Time — the most accurate check how puberty will progress.
Discussion that represents the actual puberty is, but it is considered "premature" when the breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will be slowed or stopped — him that the pediatrician may carefully trace.
Faster progression can form the basis for analyses at an endocrinologist delete serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early periods and to prevent another investigation: premature ageing of bones that could eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, the level of development, growth and the emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplovitts is careful with drugs, but acknowledges that "suppress puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers".
Other big problem is clear: parents just don't want their very young daughters had periods.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how will they cope with hygiene issues" — Kaplovitts said.
"It was a shock" — one woman at which daughter of periods began in 10 years recalls.
Although there were signs and we talked about periods, it was not emotionally ready.
He came home from school frightened and upset that it first among the girlfriends.
There are a lot of advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are guilty of milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
At boys - as in girls: puberty comes first.
Kaplovitts argues that the foundation that has the most weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat on the body with puberty terms.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are a lot of other contributing factors.
In this country African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world early puberty is influenced, most likely, by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Still puzzle: Although boys have facial hair and on lobok appear at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as at girls.
Other doctors involved in the AARP conference confirmed the complexity of this issue.
The emergence of spots and pubic hair meets even in infants and children of the nursery age.
"We must be careful how we define true puberty" — Dr. Lawrence Silverman, the children's endocrinologist in children's hospital of Goriyeb to Morristaun, New Jersey said.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the paediatrician how to speak with the child.
"This may mean earlier than anticipated conversation" — Kaplovitts explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early, need a confirmation that even when that happens before put, this process is a normal part of life.
To the head of Dagestan extremism notes are heard in the anthem of Kuban
The football match between "Anzhi" and "Kuban" resulted in a political conflict between the authorities in Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after fans burnt the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban began to sound differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem in Krasnodar Krai allegedly provides appeals to ethnic hatred, in particular, calls for war with "infidels".
Take the anthem in Krasnodar Krai, it nowadays in 1995, approved the anthem.
Same shame, and nobody does not do so.

RBS discharges two currency traders
The royal bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in the unit on currency transactions, according to information of two people familiar with the situation that is another confirmation that the global audit by regulators of the alleged manipulation in the currency market is increasing rapidly.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigations related to the world's largest financial market that daily turnover was $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS discharged during the ensuing investigation, which echoes the scandal involving manipulating the inter-bank interest rate LIBOR.
Having refused to comment on discharges, the bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulators.
"Our current investigate this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators" — reported in bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the insiders said that RBS transferred records of e-mail and instant messages that received and the former trader, to the regulator of Great Britain — to the Office for control of financial activities (FCA) sent him.
The trader, Richard achères, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, it was granted leave at its current position of the head of the European spot currency auction in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot auction in Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended as Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were not accused of any violations.
The group of contacts of instant messages of Mr. achères included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some staff after the Swiss Finma regulator said that he investigates alleged manipulation in the currency market in several Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world - the European commission, Finma, antitrust authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — believe allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation, said.
Banks view instant messages and emails for several years in search of cases of misconduct.
News about checks intensified traders in the field of activities that were in recent years, one of the largest sources of income for trading divisions of investment banks which this year, however, have had difficulty in view of the fact that low volatility of currencies reduces enabling opportunities for traders.
Some bankers tried to diminish the gravity of the situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid currency market can almost be manipulated, but senior traders say it is not always right.
According to senior trader, despite the vast amount of daily auction in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity among different trading platforms and greater use of the internal platforms by banks means that "you can start affecting the market for very small price".
This news comes on the same day, when the Credit Suisse bank announced that dismissed one of traders of the department of the share auction of the London Stock Exchange this week after that caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified relevant authorities and cooperates with the regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue have been contained" — reported Credit Suisse.

John Kerry said in an unprecedented recognition that espionage of the US "entered improperly far"
John Kerry showed mitigate tactics of the protection of trackware of the US, having made unprecedented recognition that in some cases espionage of the US "entered improperly far".
The Secretary of State also acknowledged that is guilty, along with Barack Obama, that was "on autopilot" during the emergence of loud revelations of Edward Snowden on espionage activities of the NSA.
These leaks put the U.S. Government at the centre of the diplomatic row with the allies.
Speaking via video link at the open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually received some taking place things on autopilot for such an eventuality already existed — both during World War II, and in very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, on September 11".
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government, who acknowledged that espionage, the US has been going too far, but stressed that no one's rights were not violated.
He said: "In some cases it had improperly far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the issue and to speak before people, and is conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, abuse of innocent people in this process are not present ".
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA worked well-meaning and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We work in the new world where people are ready to blow up themselves.
In the world, there is a radical extremism, reckless and determined to kill people, to blow up people and to attack the government.
And if you were able to intercept it, to stop it before this happen?
We actually prevented aircraft crashes, explosions of buildings and killing people, because we could learn about these plans in advance ".
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve the issues relating to alleged espionage of the US abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the US, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee for European affairs on Thursday said.

"It's really important to national security interests of the US that Europeans remained our supporters for our common anti-terrorist strength: Democrat Murphy working in a position, the first term and as chairman of the subcommittee of international relations of the Senate for European affairs in an interview from Washington said.
— And I go to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in combating terrorism, despite their anger on these programmes the oenb ".
News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe, sour relations with some U.S. allies while the agency head announced this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstanding of metadata that were collected by NATO allies and which they shared with the US.
The documents published by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones about 34 other world leaders have been provided in other revelations.
The director of national intelligence James Klapper protected spying activities on allies as necessary and said that this is normal on both sides.
Against this sensation of Murphy said his office will arrange a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped members of both parties and both chambers will be part of the delegation.
The names of other participating lawmakers should be expressed in the next few days.
According to him, the programme for the trip still under development.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the visit is to help improve the relationship, he said that some degree of "rigidity well-meaning" will also be shown.
He said that the European leaders must be honest with people in what spyware they used for many years.
"While we can change our trackware to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we not only who is engaged in exploration activities" — Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should go to the weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address hostility towards US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as intelligence activities of the US.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was small, Halloween was magic.
Enabled us to eat sweets with his sister, late not to go to bed and position the masquerade for our area.
I now resemble the miser more.
I didn't volunteer to circulate in the past two years, candy in the apartment, and probably will not be and this year.
But the statistics show that I am a black sheep in relation to the Halloween.
According to the National federation of retail, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and jewellery.
The only thing I wait for each Halloween — is trends.
The national federation of retail forecasts that on costumes $1.2 billion from the spent $6.9 billion will leave.
This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
It is not mandatory for women to be members of sexual professions anymore; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, burgers or carrot.
As for men, I think we will see many of the zombie thanks to "The Walking Dead" and I am confident that astronauts in the style of Daft Punk group will get into our tapes Instagram this year.
According to Google, costumes that look for most often — it is a zombie, Bateman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise, we were not only.
Moreover, according to the National federation of retail, Americans will spend this year, $330 million for costumes for pets.
This means many funny dogs-hotdogov.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time with details.
Americans will spend on them $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen company.
These are about 600 million pounds of chocolate of Hershey, candy, Milk Duds Candy, the Twizzlers chewing sweets and bars of Clarke Bar.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is great news for 41 million requiring sweets of children who were going to submit our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during the Halloween.
The only thing that we don't want to uses - these are sweets in the form of corn seeds: and yet, according to the National association of confectioners, nearly 35 million their pounds are sold under the Halloween.
These are about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
It is a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing can express Halloween essence as haunted houses.
They have amazing names, for example "Horror behind walls" (which, incidentally, is in the real prison), "Howl also shout" and "The house of shock".
Moreover, according to society America Haunts, in America there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $500 million income, as well as those amazing photos where you were almost described which your friend laid out on Facebook, and you can't clean, and then the guy who you love, sees this photo and leaves the commentary, it seems "a cool look".
And finally, we'll talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown acquainted us with Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting the lamp of Jack — it as decoration of the Christmas tree, that we do from childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for the child in pumpkin began only last year, thanks to Pinterest so most of us grew, cutting out these pumpkins, but without sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins.
Jack's lamp is slowly drying on your porch likely came from the State of Illinois, who grew up 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a more difficult task, visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa of the State of California and try to cut anything from their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.

At pawnbrokers in Singapore things go well, while the middle class experiences difficulties
In a pawn shop in the mall Bendemir in Singapore janani Amirtkhalinga puts a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay school fees for his daughter.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money is invested there" — ms. Amirtkhalinga says.
Although she earns S $3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband too works, it is not enough monthly income of the family, she says.
Indeed, demand — where the amount of debt of households grows in different parts of south-east Asia - is such that ValueMax where it executes a transaction, this week became the third Lombard registered on the stock exchange of Singapore.
The loan on the security of jewellery — it not only quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirtkhalinga) but also is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly higher than 15.4% proposed in the office of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with industry in the same shopping centre.
However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of wages and could provide loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region address in pawnbrokers as families feel pressure because of the increase in the cost of living and rapid growth of debt of households and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in developed economies, families grip low and average income in pawnbrokers to offset the decline of income in the process of slowing growth of their economies.
This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, reported raising in the family credit shoulder, largely because of growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of debt of households to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list of 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week hardly left technical recession.
On Thursday data showed a continued fall in exports and weakening of consumer demand.
"The essence of that with an increase in prices people in the middle and lower part [the scale of income] will look for ways to supplement their income, where will only be able" — tells Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Record high prices of gold in the past two years strengthened haste with which people put their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to get money for the family jewellery.
In Singapore, some 70% of the things put in 200 lombard paragraphs of the city-state are gold products.
People say: "Price of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain of grandmother and we'll get it back next month".
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnbrokers of EasyMoney witnessed the growth of the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in lombard business is such that ValueMax, operator of the office in Bendemire and 15 others same in Singapore, plans to extend not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia too, Yeakh Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax says.
The company will finance the extension, using 60 per cent from S $66 million attracted this week as a result of IPOs on stock exchange of Singapore.
While some creditors led to criticism fired because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeakh said that the pawn shop not only offers cheaper fares than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.
"Customers put subjects they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households" — she says.
The mortgage wins more and more public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, provided funding.
And thus use pawnbrokers not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits.
Rich people in Singapore also use offices of ValueMax, putting gold bars or Rolex that can give to 60 per cent of their acquisition cost cash.
We see clients from all sectors of society.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short term for commercial projects or investment, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary money problems" — ms. Yeakh says.
They sometimes simply need money very quickly.

The Russian security officers do not know of fraternal Circle group - novye Izvestia
Wrote about it INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"Following media there were reports of deposit by the US Treasury of Leps into checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'sister Circle', we saw all databases, but the group does not find", the negotiator of the agency said.
In his view, the spread of this information helps to uphold the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly working abroad.
As wrote earlier, yesterday, the US Treasury published a list of alleged members of a criminal group "sister Circle" on the site.
Among them well as the Russian singer Grigory Leps was called.
It appears in the list as "Grisha", laid out the day before.
They coincide with data from the popular Russian performer.
Are specified the exact name - Gregory Lepsevridze, a creative alias, venue and date of birth.
In addition Leps, five more people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified.
Of the US are confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on the Phuket island carried for bandits money by their order.
A photo of the singer is attached to this message and all its data that are true are specified.
Moreover, Leps really bought recently, the house on Phuket.
In the department noted that they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
Entering the man in black lists of the U.S. Treasury entails freezing of its assets to the US and a ban on business contacts with it of people living in the United States.
The assistant Lepsa Miami Serikova stated that any notices to the singer did not do: "It is difficult to answer the question whether that is Gregory about whom all speak now in connection with the scandal in the U.S.".
All that knows Leps is evidence of mass media.
Officially to him personally there were no notifications, although I don't know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, is surprising and unexpected", she said RIA-Novosti.
According to her on Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but as endorses the U.S. Treasury, on the Thai island it really has a house.
She declared that now Leps is in long Far East and Siberia tour, and that news found it during flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Black box at you in the car?
As American designers of roads try to find money to repair the scattered highway system, many are starting to see a decision in the small black box, which is clearly linked to the dashboard of your car.
These devices tracking everyone proyezzhayemy the motorist mile and transferring this information to officers are at the centre of a controversial attempt to improve outdated system of funding of America's highways made by planners in Washington and staff.
Typically boring arena of planning of highways suddenly generated intense debate and picturesque alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying to ensure the right to use small boxes to the government to track number proyezzhayemy you miles, and perhaps even where you pass them - and uses then this information in making tax accounts.
Movement of tea drinking shocked.
The American civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And while congress cannot agree, continue yet, or not, some states are not going to wait.
They reflect how over the next decade, you can switch to a system in which drivers pay for each mile of the road which they pass.
Thousands of motorists already took these black boxes, some of which have function of satellite tracking on testing.
It is necessary for our country.
"It is not an issue on which we can have an option", – Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of Governments of Southern California who is preparing plans at the first of track by the state government of miles, proyezzhayemy each California motorist, for 2025 said.
There will be changes how we pay these taxes.
Technology for this purpose already are.
This need is compounded by the lack of funds at Government Fund for the construction of motorways funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans do not buy a lot of gasoline as before any more.
Cars are more miles on a gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, did not raise 20 years.
Politicians don't want to impose a tax even one cent at the high price of petrol.
"The gas tax simply cannot be saved", – Lee Mannich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota said.
In its staff has been found on cars of 500 tracking devices to test system of mileage payment recently.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term", – he said.
The Beggar call it a mileage user payment.
Unsurprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals as through taxes it would be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the burden of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California look closely at this system during develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (a republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of transport committee of the House, said he too believes the system as the most viable long-term option.
Supporters of the free market in Reason fund of also delighted that will force drivers to pay for every mile.
"It is not just a tax, which will go to a black hole", – Adrian Moore, vice president for political affairs of Reason said.
People directly pay for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of Transport of us who in 2011 urged congress to move towards the mileage payment.
The U.S. senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million in which some 10,000 cars would take part last year.
But the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of the rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life often have to be many miles to get to work or to the city.
Some states and cities, however, go on this path independently.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon where to attend the largest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are involved.
These drivers will pay staff to run miles instead of a tax on gasoline soon.
In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the coalition of I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies as they will be able to implement these changes.
This concept was not universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers have recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can monitor each their step.
"Concern about "the big brother" and similar things represents a big problem", – Alauddin Khan managing questions of strategy and management of efficiency in department of transport of the State of Nevada told.
It was not that people wanted.
When the test was at full speed, the office of the American civil liberties union in Nevada, warned on the website: "It will be very simple to turn these devices into devices of full track".
There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where complex searches of low-cost technology that would allow authorities of the state to maintain account proyezzhayemy the car of miles, but without information about the place and time are ongoing.
If you are able to do so, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
Searches of this technology has led some agencies of staff to the small young company in California entitled True kilometres.
Originally, the company was not responsible for assisting in the taxation of staff.
She sought to enter the growing market for the type of car insurance at which drivers pay on the basis of escape.
But devices it tests, involve designers of the road because they don't use GPS and provide limited amount of information, periodically loaded via a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and do not track their location" — Ryan Morrison, executive director of True miles of travel said.
There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programmes of staff.
There are far less expensive and less intrusive way to do it.
In Oregon designers experiment providing various options to drivers.
They can select the device with or without GPS.
Or they may refuse absolutely the device, having decided to pay rather than a fixed fee based on the average of miles, which is made by all residents of staff.
In other places hope to sell an idea of a wary public, forcing devices to do more, and it is not less.
In New York transport officials seek to develop the taxing device, which will also accept payment on parking meters, to ensure "pay as you go" insurance and collect a pool of speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be recruited by benefit which to them will be offered" — it is told in the document of town-planning design.
Some designers transportation systems, however, reflect on whether all the talk of mileage payment by simply enormous distraction is.
In the city transport commission in the area of the gulf San Francisco officials say the congress could overcome very simply bankruptcy of trust by the construction of roads, having raised taxes on gasoline.
The additional single or annual tax could be raised from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, which they paid their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is — it to take aspirin" — Randi Rentshler, the director of the commission on the legislation and the public relations told.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about her private life and a host of other things.
Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will embed the dignity of new cardinals of the Catholic church for the first time in his term of office on February 22 as said the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are senior clerics in the Catholic church after his father, and they elect fathers so Francis will appoint the first group of people who will participate ultimately to choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after age of 80 by Cardinal he could not take part in his father's elections, any more — it is the prerogative of a group of 120 "cardinals-electors".
In announcing this news, the spokesman for the Vatican father Federico Lombardi said that before the construction ceremony in a dignity the meeting of all current cardinals known as the conshistory will be held.
"Pope Francis decided to report in advance of his decision to call a conshistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from various corners of the world" — Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization said that by February, the number of cardinals-electors will probably decline.
He said that usually the father calls so many cardinals, how many it is necessary again to finish number of cardinals-electors to 120, and so many cardinals aged over 80 years, how many he would wish.
The conshistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis's election in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new father of cardinals from other parts of the world to restore the balance will appoint" — he said.
In South America live forty per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the establishment of cardinals by Francis Soveta — groups of eight cardinals from around the world, it is mandated to look for ways to reform the church.
In the past, the father decided all independently.
"Now Francis elected eight cardinals that they helped him" — Valero said.
He said "it is possible" that Francis will contact cardinals for the council.
But we were not in this situation before — this for us for the first time.
Valero said fathers bundled in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises — therefore, we don't know who he would call".

The tax for foreign property owners will lead to the London bubble will erupt
The treasury implemented a preliminary assessment of the measure to a capital gains tax, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne who in the budget of 2012 introduced a rate of the state tax of 7% for homes worth over £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to their homes by association, but not as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential real estate in the Areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea making 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year already exceeds total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in state duty in expensive homes and the introduction of the related legislation against evasion it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is underestimated regardless of influence outdated municipal tax system".
"But this can lead to some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or her current owners will not want it to sell" — he added.
The value of the prime real estate — the top 5–10% of the housing market at a price — in a rich south-west belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by the Savills company, the price in the centre of London continued to show sustained growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were overshadowed by actively developing "the domestic market" to a spike in prices in the southwest, in the North (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) the cities.

After that the decision to change the profile of the plant and installation on it of equipment for their products have been made.
This year, more than 7,000 tons of total production is shipped.
Investment in plant produced more than 120 million rubles, dzyanis Gribanov said.
In October, the new camp that allows you to increase the range is launched.
At the plant is being issued as a small profile of the pipe, which is used to hothouse, of small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach level of production of 50,000 tonnes of products a year that will be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the shift to other activity, the number of employees in the enterprise it was not reduced it now makes 157 people, in the plans when purchasing a new technology - increases in staff even by more than 50 employees.
In a business, there is a retraining and necessary experts are selected from the already available.
Next year it is planned to introduce a new unit of the longitudinal became acute up to five millimetres thick that would reduce production costs, and another camp, with a speed of production of the pipe to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the business is going to master production of pipes that are used in the housing and community services.
The management of the enterprise's objective was to close to 70 per cent of the need to Tyumen region for this production.
The deputy director of investment policies Leonid Ostroumov, referring to the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machinery industries.
Forms of public support for the industry, which include compensation of interest rates on loans to purchase new equipment and costs on its leasing are also aimed at it.
In the current year is intended to provide the 150 million rubles for those goals, two thirds of that amount already spent.
The last commission, which will consider contracts of subsidies, accepts documents from businesses until 15 November.
In addition, the budget offsets the cost of attendance of local producers in the international fairs.
Next year's budget provided means of 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans to purchase new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participate in the fairs, 3 million - on energy-saving programs.
Drop to 72 million rubles of funds to compensate for an orderly and paid technology made in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long term this form of support will stop as compensation for a tax on mining that oil companies paid in the regional budget was motive for its introduction.
Now they don't do it and subsidies become direct account the responsibilities of the region.
Accordingly, the government of region considered as a priority direct support of the industry, but not funding through them the oil industry.
The assistance of the budget will be associated with investment projects that will begin to be implemented on production.
Many heads of enterprises expressed concern about the situation in a relationship with oil workers.
The grant for equipment bought by them is competitive advantage of the industry in the South of the Tyumen region, and at its dissolution it would be difficult to compete on price with a central Russia, where cheaper labour.
In addition, the issue with continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the Rosneft company that does not place the orders at the Tyumen enterprises is not yet clear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and demands for an extension had been received.
Now, businesses of the South of the area that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot create a portfolio of orders next year.
Open is the question whether taxes from the oil in the Uvat area will come to the budget of the region or they will be paid at the location of the new owner of fields.

Message: the election headquarters of Obama considered Biden's exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
Under The New York Times, the closest advisers to president Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012.
This discovery — the brightest sensation from all of the expected Mark Halperin and John Haylemann's book about campaign of 2012 "the stakes are doubled: Game Change 2012 ".
The The Times edition received a copy preparing for the book's release and reported on Thursday night that the closest aides to the President conducted "extensive research in focus groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help lift the dwindling hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to a political analyst with The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by the senior officials of the campaign headquarters and the White house, namely, the former head of the administration of the White house Bill Daly, to assess what effect will have on vote appointment as Secretary of State Clinton vice-president.
Possible replacement was a secret, which is closely guarded in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval office.
Only six close advisers to the president - including Daly, a former head of the campaign headquarters of Obama Jim Messinu and former senior adviser to the White house David Axelrod; and David Pluff — knew that the replacement is considered.
The book "The stakes Are Doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of trying to replace Biden, despite them "a close personal relationship" but eventually refused this step when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list not "will improve significantly Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
"I actively supported the multitude of things, and it was one of them" — Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that at that point, the president was in a terrible form so we thought: "Oh God, what to do to us? "
While Daley described research as "necessary verification", Martin said the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the election headquarters attached to study of quite a lot whether will bring this step dividends on the vote.
"The election headquarters don't spend such sums of money to surveys and focus groups if they do not believe anything seriously" — Martin in the programme of joint stock company 360 said.
It is not clear, however, Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daly, if the boss of the time knew him about a possible reshuffle.
While Daley also said that he did not think the president "was aware" for a possible replacement, former head of the administration acknowledged that, "probably", Obama knew.
Martin added that "the stakes are doubled" does not provide a clear answer to question whether the outcome of the political sounding reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether seriously he believes that Obama did not know about research able to exclude Biden from the electoral roll.
"Probably" — Martin replied.

Legislative prohibition forced the Russians to drink less beer
The Russian brewers have a bad mood.
On their estimations, consumption of beer in the country next year is stagnant, and it at best.
While entrepreneurs had originally relied on growth.
After all this year is developing for them failed: sales fell to 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest breweries of the country, the chairman of the board of the Union of Russian pivovarov Isaac Sheps at the third annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith said "everyday necessities in Russia" which just ended in Moscow of all this.
On it discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already been reduced by 18 per cent as in recent years in the country significant strengthening regulation of the brewing industry for the production and trafficking of beer - drink with a small alcohol content is respected, said to the audience of Sheps.
In one country in the world there is no such tight restrictions on the beer market, unpredictable introduction all the new and new illogical ban which settle allegedly combat alcohol abuse.
The brewer, complained that many legislative ban designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse has no special effects, however constantly there are all new initiatives.
Most painfully on beer manufacturers struck the ban imposed from this year to sell alcohol in the stalls.
"We lost immediately 35 thousand consumers", - Isaac Sheps said.
Next year at pivovarov two forecasts.
The optimistic - what said Sheps: sales of foam drink will remain intact.
The pessimistic - will fall to 2-3 per cent.
To maintain their profits, entrepreneurs are forced to go from the classes calculated on the mass consumer to class "premium": beer will become less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, radical effect by falling sales with a small quantity of alcohol, it is not visible.
"In my experience, the level of diseases of alcoholism is about the same - the narcologist Alexei Sotnikov reported.
However, the proportion of patients using substitutes for strong drinks, as well as those who "sat down" on alcohol-based tonics like "Jaguar" while "beer" alcoholism prevailed about 10 years ago grew.
To what will give the construction of TPU in Moscow
Each year the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport and inter-station passage (ttco).
Until 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPU.
Than in practice, the project is wrapped, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago the Smolensk subways in the Arbat and pokrovsky line was the construction fence.
The caption read that there is the location of transport and transfer site.
It was all very strange as near "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, you cannot change on it.
To reach the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome some 130 metres, including land transition through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now at "Smolensk" almost everything is over.
The flower stall disappeared, stand for newspapers have been dismantled, and asphalt before entering was replaced by a stone blocks.
Here and all transport hub.
Transport and inter-station passage happen plane and capital - explain in the press-service of capital the department of transport.
Capital TPU are not yet.
And plane assume the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of the trade objects alarming to the movement of passengers, the establishment of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, not even transport workers, and professional blagoustroitel from the department of major repairs of the city of Moscow are engaged in plane TPU.
The transport hub it is not necessarily a complex design - is explained by the director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes the homeless and boards notifying on transport arrival time is sufficient.
Here, for example, at the Yasenevo Metro opened quite full plane transfer site recently.
Let without lights, but with the captures car parks and boards indicating when the bus will come.
But in pursuit of number officials write to TPU everything that every possible thing.
In 2011, the mayor planned to build for everything about all 151 nodes, of them 59 with capital construction.
Now in plans until 2020 reappear 255 TPU.
Of those, one hundred and fifty is promised to hand over this year.
Although the city, there is a programme of development of TPU, is not identified any qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and Transport" states.
Report by the number of objects, but the quality of change on each of them often deteriorating.
Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - speed of change, second, convenience.
First of all able to replace a mode of transport, without leaving under the rain.
In Moscow at location of TPU sometimes leaves rivno on the contrary.
Vivid example of the subway "ENEA".
Earlier suburban buses from Yaroslavskoye Highway came to the square before the main entrance of the OCE.
Now their stops moved to the opposite side of the Resident of Yaroslavl on Kosmonavtov Street.
Farther from the subway, much farther from the monorail, but is closer to homes.
Although residents did not want bus station under windows at all and complained to all possible instances.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow immediately it was not specified.
The first of them began to be built at the Glider Metro about five years ago.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And indeed the tale of how the transfer site assigned to investors turns into banal shopping centre happened.
No, there are platforms for buses, the awning here not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, for the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU room was not made substantially.
They as strangers were removed away from the Metro.
But places under trade remained more.
Only one clothing 32 stores, and in general are almost everything from zoogoods to a motor show.
Well indeed, suddenly who from bus passengers want to buy on the way the new car?
At us when build capital TPU, for some reason the shopping centre always is produced.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of parking was agreed to be given to the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Glider" among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a lively trade.
The vegetables, spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-russian speech and security guards who are maliciously glancing at our photographer.
The move site eventually turned into a market.
The fact is that earlier the Glider Metro had a market, but it was born.
And in prefecture of dealers regretted and let on the captures parking of transfer site.
All the same because of high prices it is always empty there.
The most ridiculous that demolished the market to build on its place... new plane TPU.
Such here castling.
At the Kaluga Metro the approach distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, Alexander Morozov said.
After the construction of shopping centre, allegedly TPU, distance, increased to 170 metres.
To embark on a bus, you must go through all shopping centre.
After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass in the open air.
However, designs on "Glider" and "Kaluga" will seem florets soon.
In the middle of September, the urban planning and land commission of the city hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-story, apart from two or three underground circles.
The main monster will grow at the tushinskiy subway, there shall be 418.7 sq.m. of the area.
The representatives of the Office of Rail stations of the Russian Railway that are responsible for building TPU at Subway have said journalists: in future high-rise buildings shops, hotels and apartments will settle down.
Thus officials assure that multilayered parking spaces will borrow from one-third to one-half of the area.
Let's take an example "national" garages.
Let's say, garage that man 258 parking spaces, which was built on Mezhdunarodnaya Street recently, has an area of 8015 sq.m.
Funds, parking by 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsky and Razumovskaya" requires some 80,000 of "squares".
It is less than a third of that large object that is going to be built there.
Let one or two floors will go to any platforms for buses.
There are at least 150,000 sq.m. commercial real estate.
And it, for a minute, almost two ghuma.
If capital TPU at stations and train stations are built by railway workers, other platforms will be spent by metropolitenovets.
They also promised that there will be many "objects of functional purpose", including hotels, offices and even sports hall.
Incidentally, in the department of property of the city of Moscow recently said to reporters that develop a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a site for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore supposedly that transport issues for the city is a priority.
Ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or "Spadayna" in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleys and trams go down under the land on the level of the Metro and distance of approach from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.
Around any excess trade.
But throws the Moscow officials into extremes.
Or we will build anything, or otgrokhay 25 storeys with offices and apartments.
Oil has fallen in price to $96 for dulo.
Oil prices continued to fall and on Friday, when concerns about the creation of large supplies overshadowed the message indicating that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is gaining momentum.
The reference class of oil of the US in December delivery fell in the price of 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for the late morning on the European time in the e-tendering at the New York Mercantile exchange.

Rich in oil affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy on Wednesday announced that stocks of the US rose by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks stocks were replenished more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was a reference to possible increased demand, judging by the two reports on Chinese industry, which showed surge in its activities.
This indicates that the restoration of China's economy can continue to gain momentum after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum last quarter.
Brent oil — the reference class of the international oil used as well the oil refineries in the US — fell in price on 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental exchange in London.

We watched video of a match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurgist", - Chebaturkina quotes official the site "Vanguard".
Let through many pucks, not very pleasant moment.
Passed because of the mistakes, because of the non-implementation of the game task.

The profit of Bombardier decreases with the fall of supply and number of orders for aircraft
The Bombardier corporation, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday about reduced net profit for 15 per cent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
The Bombardier company located in Montreal also did not publish any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries plane and did not provide new information on, whether ambitious plans for introduction of the plane to commercial operation by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it took three more time that raises questions of whether the testing phase is progressing on schedule.
The results did not justify forecasts and led to the fall of action for more than 8 per cent at Toronto Stock exchange.
Cameron Doyerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday, the assessment with "above average market" to "average market" because of the belief that growth for action is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Although weakening in the number of supply of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the returns of the transport department" — Doyerksen in a review of the stock market said.
We believe that Bombardier will generate more business for CSeries in the process of continuation of the programme of flight tests.
However, if in the coming months, it is not announced new orders, we assume that the market will begin to be sceptical about the programme more.
Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will enable it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and for the first time circled in September after months of delay.
But so far there is little firm orders for CSeries — 177 as potential buyers await the outcome of flight tests to verify allegations of the company about fuel efficiency and earnings potential of the new aircraft.
In total there are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators.
The chief executive officer Pierre Bodoin was confident that Bombardier will achieve the object of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane has been put into commercial operation.
On Thursday heads also assured analysts and media that the programme is progressing according to plan.
"The test model of the plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected" — Boduan during a conference call said, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled for downtime of the plane.
All producers plan tests differently.
We decided to conduct the first flight and to make a break for updates, so we and came.
Will happen so throughout the programme of flight tests.
The second of five test samples must make flight in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow it as the company reported.
Yet analysts are sceptical that the first client will be able to start operation of the CSeries plane in 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said that it evaluates the vintage and will provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow rate of flight tests - although is likely also in line with the domestic schedule of Bombardier - supports our view that commissioning would be postponed for the first quarter of 2015" — Doyerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30 net income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted earnings per share remained the same — 9 cents.
The gross revenue declined slightly — from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected profit of 10 cents per share and the gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world in size the manufacturer of aircraft reported that he put 45 aircraft in the quarter which is less than the figure for previous the year - 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, without having changed since 31 December.
"In aerospace results area responded to our goal, but the small number of incoming orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor" — Boduan said.
The gross income in the aerospace direction fell to 13 per cent — to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that the gross income in the sector grew by nearly 11 per cent — to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio in the transport division was $32.6 billion at September 30 that is slightly higher than the figure of 31 December.
Problems with the execution of several major contracts negatively affected the revenues of transport division.
The office said that in the fourth quarter of a new development plan will be presented.
Shares of the company of Bombardier, which also said that the chief financial officer on Google Patrick Pichett will be on the board of directors, fell to 8.5 per cent — to С $4.83 traded in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world in size commercial producer of planes and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday on how to reduce the quarterly earnings by 10 per cent.

Two members of YMCA are accused of sexual offences, even before the charges against Jonathan Lord as the Royal commission knew
Two members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children before bringing charges in 2011 against employee of the facility on childcare in Karingbakh of Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal commission on child sexual abuse.
But in an opening statement of the commission stated that it "never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse in the organization".
The chief executive officer Philippe Hare was asked about one case where an employee of YMCA was charged with offences relating to child pornography and the other case where the instructor at the gym in YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children who were under its supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare said Gale Ferness, to the counsel assisting the commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in opening remarks to the commission also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that "there were external audits of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was on the safety of children in the forefront".
The submitted commissions of the certificate say that YMCA was informed that he received a second since the end of the four possible rankings as a result of auditing quality performed by the Department of Education and communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and a subordinate office provided a miss by hiring the Lord, and could not provide a clear understanding with the staff of the commitments to reporting breaches of security policy of children.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys within two years of his work in YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics YMCA prevented staff to report violations of the Lord in the area of safety of children.
Staff testified that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, personally looked after them, put them herself on knees, said that he loves one of them and allow them to play a mobile phone.
Daniel Okvell, which was under the direction of Lorda and asked to teach him in the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that found Jackie Barnat, the care manager over children of the office of YMCA in Karingbakh, which was the head Lorda, "very frightening and often remote".
The executive director said that he does not accept an explanation of staff that it was embarrassing for them to report on the situation to the supervisors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the thought of the need to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he submitted to the council of YMCA of New South Wales, the view that the lesson for the organization from "incident with Jonathan Lord" not "concerns reporting" from staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the emergence of charges was made by the Director-General of the YMCA on child custody Liam Whitley.
He said it was designed to prevent damage to the evidence, but "were overdo it" and this decision poorly implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not the organization, safe for children, in operating time of Jonathan Lord it between 2009 and 2011, an expert on issues of corruption of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith University reported the commissions.
He said there were "serious problems" at a set, selection, coaching, staff training and control of it.
Hearings were postponed until 20 December.
The comic-action Guillaume Niclou of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exclusive statement and historical details, but it also heavier is perceived than would have to.
The film that take place in France of the 1760th years, says bleak story of Susanne, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by the family.
When she begins to rebellious, it suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadistic prior and is the target of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls to vulgar or sensation — and that's the problem.
Because of serious solemnity the narrative risks to be a test like a vlasyanitsa and to the audience.

Ben Grinmen: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It is safe to say that the New York — the birthplace of the stendap-comedy in America: Almost 100 years ago, the variety actor Frank ippe working as entertainer at Palace Theatre Theatre at the Broadway began to tell jokes directly to public in a conversational way.
Ippe's innovation was picked up over time by others, most recently, the New York comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Carolyn Hyorsh, the founder of Carolines stendap-club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and great theatres.
"Most of these headliners began in Carolines, and then were more successful reached the point where they are already too famous to speak at the club" — said Hyorsh.
We created this festival as a way to continue with them work.
This year the event "Stendap for heroes" an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square, Garden where there will be among other Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosbey includes Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mar's speeches, as well.
The widening of the festival is also a world of comedy extended.
Some comedians participating in the festival this year became popular in the unconventional, for example through show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and spire.
Nick Krall gained notoriety thanks to a role in comedy series on little-known cable TV channel (deliberately obscene "the League" on FXX on fantasy football) and now maintains its own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast as in "Saturday evening on the air" and, in "Parks and recreation areas" while most of all it is known on a series of viral clips "Marseille - a mussel in boots".
Both Croll, and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, the liar, focused on racial topic by Kamau Bell) — is the result of decentralized world of American comedy.
David Steinberg's interview with Larry David will be one of the high points of the festival.
Steinberg began as a stendap-comedian, but then became a successful director on television and film, as well as an informal historian of the comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, it was a presenter of the show on TV Land under the name sit Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall room at the heart of Manhattan.
"This city — it is surely a central element of all the work of Larry" — Steinberg said.
He told me that the entry here, he sometimes walks on any small street between two homes and thinking: "Here if I remain absolutely without money, I'll probably live here".
