Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the cancellation of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs refused at second reading the draft amendment to the reduction of the sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the ex-Première Minister currently imprisoned.
tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced in December.
tymosenko calls the judgment of revenge policy of the regime and triggered a process of suspicions of bias of the court also to the west.
The project to annul paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the Minister ex-Premère was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have required 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The release or Libyan rebellion already has its defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates or radicals.
The Interim National Council ruled the law of Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without crime because for a flight is cut.
Women can forget the emancipation, not environmentally friendly potential of faith could face the death penalty...
It is the Quran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of tribes.
In Libya is such an order as we cannot represent and as we would surely not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial to the Libyan.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors have accepted the aid with recognition of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led the NATO strikes but Allah they celebrated the magnitude at each attack.
When it is to seek the victors in Libya, the West is not one
We have participated in, used Islam and our poilitiques walked away of the dictator as a political ally without brings no profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily Libya.
There are therefore no problem for the premises to be rid of "crusaders."
Is it that without land, oil companies will have easy access to black gold libyien.
Perhaps not as much and the West can finally boast of a desintéressée protection of human rights.
If we prevent these followers of Sharia law.

Iranian students are prepared to die for the nuclear program of their country.
They have created a human shield
A few hundred students graduate schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this gesture by the nuclear program of their country in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray at noon before the site and then called the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre of Isfahan where is processed uranium.
They have thus stated openly that they will take the nuclear program of their countries, risking their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its last information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Some in Israel of a possible attack Iranian nuclear facilities.

Feeding a child obese: does not take breakfast and takes to the deli for lunch
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, 9% of écoliersont a weight above average and 5% are obese.
As the current research obese children come from families that unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important is the environment in which human beings and the models that surround it.
On the tables of obese children found for example, of the deli 50% more often than in the families of children in normal weight.
19% of obese had french fries at lunch according to the survey conducted with a share of awareness "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of small large sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most school children today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found the time for movement.
Survey conducted on 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 primary school children in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not by chance," action supported by the general health and Unilever.
Since the beginning it is more than 12000 students from sixth to third who enrolled in this project.
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children are overweight or obese, is the absence of adequate food and not enough exercise.
"Only half the children interviewed indicated, for instance, eat 5 times per day déjeuner-en small cases - lunch - dinner goûter-, which is a basic principles of good food," says one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and lunch at the deli
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a small lunch in family at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students "families eat at the same time.
In the majority of families each takes its breakfast alone.
And the worst was identified that a tenth of the population does not at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The survey showed that in the families of obese children are more often French fries unhealthy.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drink each day of sugar-sweetened drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned made sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepares you eat
Another part of the investigation has allowed children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from opportunities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far away, in terms of a healthy diet, the ideal."
Among their favourite meals there is a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
"The more alarming is a strong preference for the sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the investigation.
For lunch are the pulp who took place just before the first white meat.
The children were not at all to starch and preference for fish and vegetables was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive the information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session" Obesity is not by chance, "was listened to a definite willingness to move towards a healthy diet," indicate the results of the investigation.
The most prominent was for example, with regard to the lemonades sweet because the children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce the flat sweet and "knedliky" (Specialty Czech pellets of bread flour or potatoes).
The designer must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation on how to learn for the designers, I started a little angry that there were many from the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen afterwards.
The presentations of three professionals of specialty, clothing characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays that is truly "packed."
This time we have with the Director (Alenka over there is no boy) Treaty of how to dress the woman who has no measurements.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy, without special curve, another of overweight.
The designer must know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extend a neck or add curves.
We arrived and nicely to emphasise the character and also not to pay too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a size.
If there is a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to do it.
And you won't regret it because clothing that is impeccably is invaluable.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in the shifting coiled and does not take to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or embroidery.
Of course there are many examples of shapes and I am pleased that I have all week to sort all information received.
But I also fear that, considering what to do at home there are too many.
Each student received a celebrity to pay for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current, the type of personality and appearance.
I will have to dress up Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the back of my mind, it gives me pleasure, because it is better to dress as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera which has taken almost a hundred kilograms in recent times (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or search the web, print and graphic design work.
The Moodboard, as they say on the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic design.
Also reflect on the part of the styling is also important.
The designer dresses is not only the physical but creates for example, the pages in the magazines (on products given the trends for purses, coats, etc.).
Mario, such as designer and graphic artist, we had all this.
But this,... Until Sunday
The designer must have a general vision
Three guests of specialty have given a diverse aspect to the meeting on Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub Polanka designer fashion and Ben Renc, photographer of fashion.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use.
And a designer of talent to work with a single dress differently.
The variability is for this example.
As for example, the coats that must be raised from classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but it can also pay the naked body, with pumps and the picture as a dress.
Or simply walk up the sleeves or the pass and immediately have a new look.
"Play with this," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start doing things," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines is sometimes seen something else.
No statement on the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer should have much more variants of clothing that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story which will have a dozen pages (and therefore a dozen models) I have to be ready to "trimmed" at least a fortnight.
And also, clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with this during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success we was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but its image and marketing have made it a star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of designers are still cautious.
And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is sufficient that I know something but I look at the second).
And if someone is a styling from us, then we must rely on the fact that we are with high probability a completely different size (smaller) than it has in reality.
We have then to navigate on google and ensure if Supporting Boulevard of the celebrity in question, if it has weight or grown etc.
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to move in the mode and assemble models.
He should contact the persons he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Guess is people, not to pander, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you sort his cabinet and the complete new elements you can't throw everything and say, My God what horror."
"You will find a few cases that you will find him and advise them with what you wear them," says Mario.
It has shown us what must contain what is known as the "placovka" or bag of designer.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as the scissors, the rolls for hair or pins to nurse, there is also the nylon (that the designer used to photograph products such as bags, or hats), clips with special ignored a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of bar are not utlisables because they could damage the clothing) or a sewing kit.
So that we can not only of people listening but who tried something practical way they taught us how ressemeller properly footwear.
And in the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, particularly outside it.
And so we have glued and pasted.
We were not entitled to receive the scissors to prevent injury inadvertently.
It is therefore truly skills.
Mario made me pleasure when he praised me for my creation.
The jurisdiction which I have addressed is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the second weekend of courses
I began to understand that the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run competition across America.
Revision
Originally a race without a problem because of a series of errors stupid of people who have nothing to do with a morning routine at work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something more.
The new Part subtitled The Run has produced great expectations before his exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of race Need for Speed already and a kind of game from the parties jouables that would not only with points.
We were curious how will be added the passages in which the main hero out of his car and does what he wants.
As already begun in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what we atttendait.
These are potentially games arcades race but the whole lower because of some unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years.
They are not really mistakes but rather an expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has said problems and to address them is to participate in illegal racing across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is the first to arrive in New York.
The idea has some interesting points.
The itinerary is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
Which means that each race is on another route and the steps in different environments that differ quite well each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the sense that the game is something identical to it.
Some environments are also quite beautiful even if the technical level is the same kind of previous levels.
Finally it is not the end of the world.
But the driving through the desert, in landscapes of fall or in highly snow-covered mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition from time to time with a non-standard element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you decreases the visibility.
In the mountains and then you have to pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
In addition to that the different races are well designed them one by one.
There is only a small number but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the number of opponents (as in a conventional running) and then you are against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to get the situation difficult.
The novelty outside the vehicle.
Rather, it is an interactive when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you have to help by slapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are moments of this type that what you want to be concrete (there are only three).
The result is this because this is not likely to hinder, in the context described above, in the elements that enhances the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we cannot say that this is negative.
With regard to the realistic simulation you go see elsewhere.
But although there are better in the conccurrence the model of conduct goes very well with the type of design.
So everything is ok.
The problems start to appear after a period of time.
Has the diffférence model of conduct, that of collisions is not yet ready.
We do not expect this game a complicated and collisions, but when you did not, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how well your car, this is not completely good.
During the overruns tight you touch each other sometimes slightly but otherwise your car share in acrobatics mad.
Or is found.
Through the system, this is not really a problem but that you really riles.
The recovery is so that when you phut or you are out onto the stage the game you back at the time of the last point on the route.
But you have only 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 reboots you have to start the game from the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, in the event that something is not right, that old adage on which you can really count.
Sometimes the reboots do not help and we must find the solution in remémorrant memory piece of the route in question.
The central fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that we must move from a certain way otherwise it does not.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of vehicles "civilian" always in the same configuration that you have come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or a minute late.
The angry this are the situations when you see the adversary move easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you need to be set aside and the conturner or brake.
It is equal if you go out to him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it is always close to your nose.
Opponents also have other benefits.
During the period of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you still have the same opponent in front of you in the same place.
This is the thing most at the end when driving on a bridge in the opposite direction.
The enemy must at all costs to you.
When it passes you you obstructs the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter into a number of times.
It is understandable that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that bored quickly.
And it is a pity because through a model of conduct simple the game is interesting and areas with both action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there is no chance of being bored or something else.
The original idea is the change in car during the races.
You must pay attention to the fuel pumps on the routes because you can change cars but most of the time that you will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are ideal for cities, the big-engined American for highways straight and the super sports cars to exotic trappings on the pipes very technical for example, on roads in lace in the mountains.
And the method of challenges, which are racing in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main plan of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points to be added to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects are beginning to unlock:
It connects with the on-line function Autolog which among other compares your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel subway (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (a priori) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap metal.
Has the drafting we had a discussion for a few days to determine whether someone has actually thought at the time of the creation of this game or if the authors take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really cool.
Which hampers is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases.
This concerns especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid does you no good.
The audio portion is good and the runway is choice.
In order to please the more and more particularly the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix," but it can be expected that, and the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NTS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The amusement is really well but prepare you to ensure that the mistakes you type in the eye with the force of a reflector aerodrome.

vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave as négativistes and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically deleted the balance between the institutions'
"I did not expect such a war as hard."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players get used to their new role," is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law Ambassador Czech near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could envy, it has shown how it takes its motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning echoed the criticism that it is bland, that this is a desk, that there can rempplir no mission and I must say that it has knocked the wind out of everyone because it takes its role to perfection."
"This is a man who listens to 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is that the European Union?" "What do I call telephone number?," so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the policy of the Union in the face of the statements, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cheese cooked who feel very strong) 
Madam Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that has lived, lives and will live in a time near the European Council.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago of succeeding.
The Czech have solved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a summit for a Partnership Oriental.
She described the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, Madam "activity reached its high" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now.
There must also approve the new budget septimal of the Union which becomes very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and economies, which industry will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled the slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an Europe understandable."
"I really don't like the foreign words, abbreviations, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that nobody in Brussels of gherkins or twisted, bananas, large or that nobody has prohibited syrecky. "
It wants to use the environment of the EU and see more of Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptic and people who see the things that in their negative aspect that positively.
In addition it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support of the Czech part.
A Czech Presidency to success she then underlined the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad.
"Believe me, when I come to the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, English said:" Hey, what you do, that there is still the Visegrad? "And it is not at all happy."
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future new rules hard fiscal policy facing the Member States.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, which is rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro area and other outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
First it was said that cooperation among the countries that do or do not want to remain in their corner. "
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be an Europe really two-speed" Madam, expects Vicenova.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases in which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not just the policy of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to seek the word which is as close to the IBM strategy, the nearest would be "the long term."
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and yet since its creation it took a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy has been laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "PENSE"! "Became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the veritable developed by Watson.
IBM for us means thinking long-term continuous movements led to the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that she always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all other around it.
This has allowed us during our first century of technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has reported for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only one of the first American to have employees paid vacations, employer-paid insurance a more uniform of Employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a system of relationships with the client well developed.
The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because this will be a Rometty women- Virginia - which should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
It is working with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years is what is known as the jamy, brain- storming online from what are many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he had a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500000 people work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that provide a secure position in the areas of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a firm technology," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a firm Technology Policy but a firm that helps solve problems of the world of business using its technology," added Geogre Consulting firm Colony of Forrester Research.
As the firm itself there is a difference between enter the market and create this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue," as it is known in the United States with regard to its slogan- in a hundred years it has grown into one of the largest global firms.
This is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, services of Council at the level of the products of the server to nanotechnology.
It has many patents of all technology firms American and five of its employees received a Nobel Prize.

IBM found itself this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.
Overview in advance
Not all innovations and manufacturing who have had the preference of the client and the time - IBM for example, has failed the bet on an operational system own OS / 2, the service Prodige online or of the IBM computer PCjr:
"From the moment that your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain fixated on the past," noted Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM does not have a problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work she is headed.
Unlike for example, of conccurent Microsoft that at the base is and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In the IBM, services, which are trained to a fifth by the software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
Yet in 1990 it was with more than the motié participation the highest representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM sold assets to low performance for $15 billion, during cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the requirements of its first head Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its volume of investments.
Now it appears that IBM is the current crisis without interference?
The stock price IBM has progessé from 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The company's logo IBM is to change but not its values.
It is for this that this giant flexible control other crises.
History of IBM: A from slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
The International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York one hundred years ago; she had initially the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a mark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "clocking," clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Ranlett Charles Flint that until 1930 the Supervisory Board of society.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The leader of the then shadow the founder of the business - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and culture of the society.
Watson led the firm kusqu" in 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all machinery possible for business and trade - of cheese slicers and meat until the cash registers.
In the first four years during which Watson led, the turnover is multiplied up to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm if irreplaceable that after 40 years of leadership is the son who took the Chair of Director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
In the 60 s people and computers IBM NASA has helped guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family computer - the IBM System / 360.
The PC classic which determined the standard computer at the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its manufactures computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take on board and services with high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM in the last three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a planet smarter."
Its objective is the smart use of technology in areas such as for example, the transport and management of cities.
With regard to the area of trade IBM has developed a short time ago a platform "Smarter Commerce" that helps marketers to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a strong history also on our territory.
She set up its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic centre for outsourcing of Brno.
The Central for the Central and Eastern European seat in Prague and there is also the team's research and development that is responsible for the recognition of the floor.
rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Lourdes you can keep that donkey, I want more!
Rychtarova Darina (53 years) said it.
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return to the house.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future.
"Pepa may return to the house, but not am partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Rychtarova Darina Donna asylum in summer to Bartosova in her home, she had no idea that the couple would not work.
When Iveta after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa does not drove the singer.
And he admitted in public that it liked it.
With time Darina has resigned, has accepted the binding of her husband and has come to say goodbye forever.
rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome in the waiting room of the house.
"This is the biological father of my son and if it wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will be outside."
"It will be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," suggested a Rychtarova by showing that it is a departure from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I will stay with Iveta and will not disturb."
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect him."
"The company continues, I am of the repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina is completely normal but we do not lying in bed at all," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it will not prevent it.
"We set down together and I am not interested in knowing where it goes, with whom, and if it has an affair.
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love "Iveta on me and I take full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
The worst defects of women: It matters also?
If you ask the men to determine typical defects, all women, both, are able to get them out of their hole. "
My dear, you'll see in the following lines of vices female arriving to pump blood veins of men.
The purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
You must buy at least a garment per week?
You are happy to buy and packet during the sales?
In your case we can talk about the purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you will say, which would pass to window shop clothing stores, to seek for oneself of beautiful clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most women buy a hobby, it can be to man a hell.
Remember only how many times have you said to your spouse he waits to entry...
Continuing dissatisfaction
"I am not too big"?
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilograms - I should start in sport?"
"I like?"
These phrases you send, not something?
Yes?
You are therefore part of these women who are so obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop to look after yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain about her appearance.
Sex strong does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and more women are empoisonnantes.
The following orders and cleanliness in the first place
This is like a merry-go-round.
Window washing, vacuuming, clean soil, dust, stripping the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have sullied the sink, fouled the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you have precisely this obsession, try to bear in mind that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness must not be the first place in the family.
This desire harmless of cleanliness may spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of undermines
"This tracksuit used in the bin."
"You put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you do on your partner this undermining of this way several times a day, you really break it down.
It is clear that you are not going to harm you want everything is impeccable.
Perhaps if the men knew, women would not have to be so much work of undermines...
Defamation, sexual taunts
Defamation, sexual taunts and insults against someone are also the own for some women.
Women are particularly likely to relations and so are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps that each of us a small sexual taunts harmless here and there.
Hand on heart this is a feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise each other and are for them - particularly to work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Players and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr has participated twice to the victory of Philadelphia for the NHL game on Monday on the ice of Caroline and is once again leading players Czech productive for the competition.
From the point of view of the star of 39 Claude Giroux, who has never been a more and was named the best player of the match, it was in both cases.
Voracek Jakub, who played with Jagr has also registered two goals during the match.
Players after the match of transatlantic told reporters that he had advised Giroux that this would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt."
"Any time you sense this is upon us," said Jagr after its action Giroux marked a first goal of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of the Hurricanes in the puck and presented to the striker Maxime Talbot.
A second before the break, the first local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part owned the Flyers.
To Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr McGee scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that it is the best player in the league but it really is part of the three best," said Jagr about its centre.
"I never thought I'd do at the end of their career with a hokeyjiste like him."
"I am really pleased with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the other NHL players of the team have tried to play on me, now it is my turn," said Jagr.
Carolina took a tragedy of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again to Dwyer on a penalty goal she finished with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read has not ruled out other complications who completed by two to one.
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area."
"It tapped the puck, I have taken to the speed and (Read) went to the corner farthest from the cage.
"I tried to hit and I arrived," describes the last goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.

The Canadians have not faced with a defender experienced their advance of two butset lost after a penalty kick by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has transformed none of their attacks.
It is the fact that the line back was sick that has especially been interfering with the Raytheon local rather than points lost because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"It is zero."
"We have played the game with only an experienced player, the rest they were young."
"But there is nothing to be done, that's the way it is," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on this replacement has not been enough and we could not resist."
"We had just to simplify the game, pushing the puck out of our area."
For this we had limits, "said one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec, attended the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated at goals of the Jets, who issued a series of 5 matches lost.
How have evolved travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 in Czechoslovakia travel agencies of state: Cedok, Sporturist, elements, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time of travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was authorized to travel in Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have a fondness for the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for tourists Czech.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that he was not authorized for the citizens of the Socialist block (also for African-American) to travel individually even in the framework of the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example, in Poland and the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation if not the individual was not authorized.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West but had to wait in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good standard" within the travel agency.
And even after that this was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency that was the condition for travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of foreign currency (Western) to travel to the west.
The Czechs were most often their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs are bought and this usually lasts up to now.
Travel of Czechs have since been since 1989 a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox which we have not aware today is that the country's most popular is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90 s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west have caused a huge wave of visits of short duration especially in Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris organizations travel the Czechs were sleeping in tents in parks because our revenues, we were unable to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czechs was at the time of transfer its own food, sausage, etc... To save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna has allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy the currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which resulted in around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with bonds by charter air through contracts have extraordinarily reduced costs compared to what there was before.
In the late 90 s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries around the world to share the EU who later have facilitated our trips.
Another interesting time in the history of tourism post-revolution was prepared, when the first charter air to a country exotic, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year of direct air charter take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
This is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the country each year exotic!
Still an interesting time in this period that symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU have abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to join completely in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than $15 000 per person for a vacation abroad including the annexes. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but it may end with a situation without solution "a pat"
Nearly 5 months already football Czech President and it is without risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known even after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday at Nymburk.
However there is still no agreement on how to vote is required.
Without this agreement it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hašek has resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hašek football came back to differences between the chambers of the Association who may not agree on a joint candidate.
This has fully demonstrated on 16 September when he had to choose a new president.
Delegates to the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the national House in Prague because the negotiation has been blocked and there was not a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on the fact of who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the representatives also statutory or officials with full powers.
In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment with the help also of the Bureau for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of the full power is not possible.
The differences continue always about the regulation for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its negotiation planned or extraordinary, has contributed nothing to the situation
Opinions on the possibilitě voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same.
The question is: how to the third round in order not to become the pat.
"The bone of contention is the following fact: either proceed under the Statute or find another model," noted one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda that represents professional football in the association.
According to the rules of the model is expected in the third round as the candidates who received the most votes in percentage terms in the Chamber for which he or she is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw in order that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes of the two chambers.
And the Czech Republic is the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely deny the concept bicameral," admits Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote under the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even if it considers that elections in the Statute benefit the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I would like to vote according to the statutes of the association."
"For that there is not yet of ideas such as imagined by a representative during the General Assemblies past," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and which in its submissions is defined primarily against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him to Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will co-operate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"The qualification possible today in Championship should calm down."
"Football will be back on a wave of happiness and there one more drive for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec which of the three has the greatest experience in leading football both professional and at the regional level.
rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are trends to change regulations to design."
"This can lead to a blockage at the General Assembly."
"I hope that the healthy reason will prevail," said Rajchl.
There is not much time to a common agreement to all parties.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if any management of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which had to travel to Podgorice between the other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not departed for technical reasons and it was a variant to bring a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the parties torn within the sports association the country and to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state subsidies, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the Union of the Czech Sports that must determine the direction of the sport Czech after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because it sees no candidate correct.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly that the profile would have responded to what it calls for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be put in campaign to this high office.
"If such a candidate, I support, I fight for him and I do not go for the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech News Agency (TKC).
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta access to the head of the AFRT which in principle would be the most likely candidate for that election.
Paclik also points out that in cases where it won the next election it would hold the post of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in an experienced manager and of a high level, but that is not linked with the world of football.
"I have discussed with people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
Which, it is said, especially Paclik embarrassment, it is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, man to the controversial reputation that is known in the wings as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies the position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, which is a trader from top flight, it would be even less favourable football," proclaimed Paclik.
What the still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was delivered a few years ago in the course of eavesdropping as part of a corruption investigation, for which Pelta has emerged without any sentence.
"I do not know what Pelta prestige would bring to the football."
"And how would we be regarded in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," says Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the case where Paclik prevail in the vote on Thursday, it should prove that he could work with Felta.
rajchl, another candidate who was supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.
"It (Pelta) would be the first with which I would go."
"It has strong abilities"
"It would be able to show up for example, as Head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association it would not be capable."
"I keep my nose out of this that I do not know," says that Paclik in September attracted much attention when it has called for the annulment of the Commission of the arbitrators with ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that he also directs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support last May's triumph in first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture."
"I freinerais the influence of special interest groups that have for example, tend to affect the Commission disciplinary and appeal, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik that do not chache its antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It also would consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power to lobby with high-level political would provide for sport more money from the tax on the games.
"It is one of the key points that the new President should address."
"If it is the tax on games of chance and the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not take its current with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"This is not ideal."
I see no reason to convey my shares of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to go back a year and a half after, "said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to situations of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidate to the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future to rows over the regulations for the elections.
The official of Jablonec is before the meeting on Thursday to Nymburk very optimistic and believe that the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September which has not carried out promised precisely to focus on the national representation and financial resources if elected.
It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and the delay of two months could allow him to defend his vision of the direction of the football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels of football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday, there is a President."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he says, but it is more closely associated with the club of Jablonec, worked a greater number of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is an euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly of June of the Statute were approved that were not perfect as all have seen."
"Had it not all these various interprétattions we would already have been a President since September," said Pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I will take it as a personal mission and I am prepared to take all the responsibilities in the event that it does not work."
"It is a principle without which we would not exist," added Pelta.
Then it works, it is said, not to confront its adversaries.
He said previously that it may cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledged having regard to his training in law and it knows that its adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.
It has not contested for a long time Tonas Paclik that instead of criticising Pelta.
"It is changing in football for a year and has already had some success."
"Its attacks were not of the most honourable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta to the address of his opponent, he says, but remains faithful to the proclamations that he made in September.
His weapon the strongest is his knowledge of football from the lowest level up to the national representation.
This should be a vitirne of football.
"And also I would endeavour to complete all the cases that begin with that of Bohémians or the result of the corruption scandal."
"I would be entering immediately into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money to any football," said to the Czech News Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring forth any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he told Monastery where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will come to the beat."
"Football needs credibility and it will when there is a new leader," says optimistically Pelta two days before the day likely impact on her career public servant.
rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please many, supposedly.
rajchl promises, however, that in the cases where it would be elected will begin to work hard.
He wants to systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee are responsible for different areas of football.
He has also promised to resolve the matter Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football make more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hašek.
"As President I want to play football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, of professional football and a football for youth."
"But I am not saying that I will do that alone," said in an interview for Rajchl TKC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee to ensure that each member is responsible for a specific area."
"And I will hand out difficult missions for that football is a great step forward."
"Many people will not be happy, because it will be to begin to work hard rather than criticise others."
He referred, it is said, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical mood.
"About me, it is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if this is worthwhile and if I have people behind me that I will continually spanner in the works and issue doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people have said that I should not give up, because they also."
"It is a confidence that I cannot betray," he says.
This motivates them, they say, is also to continue the work begun with Hašek.
"Since these last two years there has been a lot of fact and I do not want to let them down."
"There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone.," "he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hašek.
"I think to a systematic work and that is something that Pelta Mirek do not know what to do."
"Behind him are people who fairaient football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been selected."
"You can reproach me for a number of things but certainly not to support a situation."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been selected
And it confirms once again that it would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do its utmost to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one and the other Czech Moravian which the winners would be in first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is currently to find of young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl can assess its own chances of winning.
"I feel the ongoing support of the House Czech who elected me as its Vice President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl which envisages among its future success to save tens of millions of kronor on contracts disadvantageous, negotiations of contracts with television and on the law on the games.
He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
While he said about Pelta "that it is disqualified because with him the footblal Czech would lose its credibility," he thinks that the second Paclik adversary is a strong candidate who has to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen he made that year a superb job."
"If elected he would continue in what has been started by Hašek and would not change among the people in the Commissions."
"It does not want to spoil its success," said Rajchl which has assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
A leap in the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in optics, pools of UFO beautiful Budapest: Who travel across Europe can live his miracle blue - and after having turned the city or a long promenade- may leave his legs tired in water baths.
A book in which swim basin can experience the most of well-being.
When Iris Meder were traveling research during the past 18 months, there is a subject that should not be missing from his baggage: a bathing suit.
Lying on his back in the water, it was the cupolas artistically arranged, and swam against the marbles Putten who was waiting on the other side of the pool and was to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools of these converted.
If a covered swimming pool was fun, it noted in his notebook without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented in his book already published: "Badefreuden Bain (the joys of everyday life." The municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the palaces of historical bath in the forest, "buildings of concrete Hardcore" in the Taunus.
It has led its "trips to the bathroom the most exceptional of Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German 46 years is a real devotee of the culture of the bathtub.
Meder, explained that she has not much interest in the sport but feels particularly attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that fans of swimming must be content to rest of blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach, whereas the joggers breathe perfume mesmeric of spruce forests, or can listen to the trill of birds in the park.
"I asked myself why a day swimming pools should in fact be always so ugly," said the Viennese.
"I started a collection of beautiful bathroom."
The surface of the water strengthens doubly architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and sauna volatile oils - factor of well-being in swimming are enormous because all the senses are awake, Meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more, the rooms to swim could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor has a surface water in the swimming."
"It is a transparent, but reflects on the other hand, however, the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically a twofold: of vaults high, tiles, art scene.
The volume of image of small format "Badefreuden" is a report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of well-being historic - it is certainly to make a leap in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered copies remarkable during his research in Hungary.
In addition to the well-being of beautiful as bathing Széchenyi aged 100 in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the bath (karst cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a spa bath basins filled with water containing the alkali and (in Termálfürdö Városi only) and located in a building in the shape of bottle.
However, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. As a roof bath of Zurich was the city in its view, can be seen the snow-covered Arlberg route from a pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which to observe the presentation on the ski area.
Perhaps the design of the more extraordinary awaits the swimmers in one: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an UFO landings that has landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rising from three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
The Alhambra in forest black
The smell of bleach is not all pools of the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths are a smell of sulfur, the Árpád-spa in the Bekescsaba Hungarian sends a strong smell of oil, that it is difficult to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell is alkaline waters therapeutic containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and its silt you sticks to the skin as soon as you let slip in the pool - a spa experience.
During its quest of the beautiful pools, Iris Meder has also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz outdoor pool, free and open air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricaded.
The bath designed by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.
Looking back through the window of the immeuble-Art New in rouge-blanc-jaune, it noted the vitality of the weeds between the tiles.
It observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palace of spa of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only elements néo-romains coming out since its creation in 1844 but still a Moorish in Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.
Since its modernization careful of 1995, the thermal bath remains the favorite of the expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a good performance than to melt building styles were so different in an unit so great," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Speculation agricultural
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
Christian Teevs
The German bank abandonne-elle its commodity speculation?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw conclusions from it.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that the banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this business channel because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
It is the result of a decline at the direction of the organization of consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid October.
The author Harald Schumann stressed in this paper that speculation Awards on raw materials, the price goes up and that banks share a complicity to famine.
The campaign consumer protection is specifically against the leader of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts now share the view that the betting public have posted offers and requests - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann was responding to the criticism differently from U.S. competitors: It promised to investigate the allegations and said, "no matter is worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information SPIEGEL ONLINE of an international working group is currently reviewing the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank must be submitted - with recommendation, usual.
In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
It could result in a reduction in the market of raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built its Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows a draconian manner, how banks today to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly today under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in his portfolio, for which the money was invested in speculation," said Bode.
"It is not important, for Mr Ackermann, but it is a question of people hungry or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may seem at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank did announce on Monday that the president of the Administrative Council will not change what is provided for in the Administrative Council.
Ll could improve its brand image with the abandonment of agricultural speculation controversial.
And about potential losses, it has little to worry about - his successor will therefore deal with these.
One in two would terminate investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date more than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, November 7 and 8 cent decline the Institute conducted questionnaires from 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on prices of food products are made.
Many clients of the bank would also personal consequences if they knew that their bank is involved in such operations: one on two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on raw materials.
43 percent déconseilleraient of such a bank to their environment, 49% said they would at the termination of their account to change d "bank.
21th home in Vienna
The Pavilion who moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with senior, low and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell in ruins.
Now it is open to new and takes place of house of exposure.
If there is an enthusiasm for post-war modern architecture, for his clear forms, its hangars glass, its patterns and bold and its new construction materials that are typical of the belief to technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the event in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion Schwanzer was formerly the "Grand Prix for Architecture" for its construction steel and glass, and suspended.
The construction is up to our days as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He has made the architects if famous, he has also built the Pavilion for the Austrian.
With its legendary home to four cylinders BMW and its adjacent construction in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the world in the Garden Switzerland at the station in the south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically or technically adapted for a museum - no walls to the works of art, not a good environment.
However it was also long used, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as "House of the 21th century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The new start has been carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which has become the new Director in 2007 of the gallery Austrian Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian at a considerable career in his youth, figure skater, subsequently in Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, it has led to the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained of public funds and private sponsorship and exploitation.
Except contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba which the foundation of the same name have been exposed, a café and bookstore, and an office must be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the Krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because it had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna, and for him the flag was "an extremely important" place where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibits.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, who lost in generosity and lightness following his visit to Vienna and by its change of use.
In the current changes, there were major problems: the building was "a chasm energy," said Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows of glass facades were changed insulation, glass fibre reinforced glass and the roof was replaced by a glass of safety.
The beams of thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new operation, a sign of light, between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entry - it is almost a new construction, but always the slight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors origins remained, the house is painted in a hue protection against rust colour red-brown.
And the movie theatre is even exactly identical to what it once was.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and that appeal also to the Office of the protection monuments," says Krischanitz and it draws attention to a soil crude underground.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and the transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a story typical of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the conscience."
But in this case the House of the 21th century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck: urban construction around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the "neighbourhood of the Central Station" any newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may occur: the House of the 21th century could benefit from the support of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased the art centre temporary Berlin, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn plans a crisis winter in the millions.
The railway company has developed a plan-crise, which aims to prevent accidents train in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against the rail accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn "in this regard will spend more than 70 million this year.
The newspaper "Bild" -Zeitung reported in advance on a plan-crise internal to the group, that investments of a total of approximately EUR 300 million would be set up in 2015.
This should allow greater availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of employees internal and external for snow removal of rail facilities and docks should between other double and go to 16.000 people.
The goal is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the phase of service and 90 percent of the needed to service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents occurred also this winter.
Last winter the railway company has had a great many problems for the transport of "users, because it lacks between other reserves in case of inclement weather conditions.
That is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authority on the part of the Department of the railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has since years of what to do, as it must have the axles of trains ICE significantly more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE in the Central Station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank "pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of the chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank Deutsche Bank "must pay a fine" of two million.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant sector caught up in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt pay in comparison to $145 million (EUR 106 million) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA door to major banks a series of charges, and to have this encourage cooperative banks to make false claims about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and have led to banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied, to have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiate a procedure to the court," said an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has recognized in comparison no fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks of USA and intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of clients.
The NCUA tries to repair the damage incurred billions of dollars.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other large banks to party and it has been brought before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is of "Mortgage-backed Securities."
Credit companies are at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, This has been fatal to a large number of companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years ago, at the present time it blows on the banks of a wind storm.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought many remedies for redress and to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two financial real estate d "state U.S. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac" benefit in kind during business Mortgage of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, this is of several transactions for a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities, that the Frankfurter meets "substantial losses" but without a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had dismissed the claims as unjustified and vows to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett increases of $10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests tremendously in the IT company IBM.
Since March, it bought shares with a value of more than ten billion.
So far the large U.S. investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not invest in companies computer IT, given that the long-term evolution of companies do not disclose that poorer prognosis.
However, he read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector.
He had already understand much earlier that IBM proposes especially of supply of services and computer systems for the IT sectors other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is seen as an attack on in the world of finance.
Therefore the activity IT IBM gives itself the right to call itself "Mr IBM."
As Buffett revealed today at l "economic programme, CNBC that he purchased since March of IBM shares with a value of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far.
He commended management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM, for some time on the lucrative IT services as a "operation centres.
The pioneer of the computer, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consultation that computers business very well.
Buffett had until now avoided rather technology companies.
He said that he is investing only in businesses he understands business.
But Buffett attacks rather Freight rail, to manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares with a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
This octogenarian of 81 years had resumed in the 60 s "small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and was promoted to the rank of one of the most prestigious global companies, through smart investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
Its meaning almost to earn money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett actions IBM increased by one percent to the award.
"Big Blue," as also IBM, has a market value of a total of more than $220 billion and with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, it does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell Zwickauer" the Turkish media are skeptical of the state of German law.
A newspaper even speak of a "bloody," which would now.
The killing of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
As a result of this new, Turkey and the population German-Turkish reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many of the German-Turkish spectrum thought to death for a long time coming back: since the incendiary attacks in November 1992 at Mölln and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this context extremist right-wing against the Turks.
There is in Germany a xenophobia, it has never been question.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, shows the proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the ideology," bloody "was the title of the publication on the Internet for the Turkish daily" Haberturk. "
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the authors would have been a v-homme Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the quagmire of extreme right.
It is calmly responded that the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence before the Brandenburg Gate.
It is only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German political and Turkish had thought about a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment.
It is with tapestry-woven woollen that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a slap in the face: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the platform turque- Haber "X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also the release of the "German Hürriyet" is not short of unambiguous conditions.
"It begins to puer," This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and would have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was seen very critically on the forums German-Turkish and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it is not already come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to investigate suspects in some quarters of the extreme right, wonder the authors.
More than a means to at least rhetorical or drastic: "If the case continues to be rushed, it will remain to migrants nothing other than self-defence and armaments."
"It will be the best self-defence."
"The inner peace in Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," wrote "signs."
What this means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks at Mölln and Solingen in the 90 s have explained.
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, on what the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is the failure of the German policy after the terrorist attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors at Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolence to the Head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by its Minister of Foreign Affairs Kinkel - Klaus Kinkel had at the time in his speech, how many taxes, the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its fiscal burdens.
The current Turkish media report demonstrates once again how the distrust of many Germano-turcs is deep in the "state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and re-evaluation of terrorism far-right in Germany, a clear message this time is necessary.
The bank scandal of Lake of Zurich
The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has been almost in bankruptcy the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber's "was imagined.
After his departure of the head of the Bundesbank; it has been informed in July that it would occupy a position in 2013 almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards a career unexpected and lucrative.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, has welcomed Switzerland; for its beauty and the UBS for its strength and has recently obtained from kind comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has passed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A merchant of securities of UBS in London had diverted all the safety systems of the Bank and had singed approximately EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of Directors of the UBS Grübel Oswald, a banker known not only in Switzerland, has had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is regarded as since suffering - and all are asking: When Axel Weber does finally?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as communicated the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
It is not much more banker, "economy professor and President of the bank, and certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
At one time it assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has yet to prove once again that it has long since earned the title of "the largest bank to scandal in Europe."
Indeed, the UBS was a huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years of a scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, are the proud if Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and sound, but also shrewd, she combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank.
Therefore the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had raised as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
This has made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later Professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank to my students."
"In the current perspective, we wonder: how is it that I could have simply mistaken to this point?"
It is profoundly wrong.
In 2007 it emerged that for the first time something was amiss at UBS.
In the middle of the year the President Peter Wuffli withdrew from surprisingly, which was previously regarded as a high intellectual and a brilliant banker.
A few months later it was why it was gone.
The division of the bank had singed with documents and has risen to write off billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross.
For this she did find investors, but that, shortly before, would have her: a bottom of Asian state non-transparent from Singapore and an Arab state, which was passed over in silence, to the point where it has never even learned his name.
"This was the first time.
In April 2008 it has worsened.
The bank was to announce losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Ospel Marcel, who in 2006 was still the second Board of Directors paid to Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its mistakes, investment in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank has bought from UBS tens of billions of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.
Any Switzerland was hit - because it noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to house if large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the 2007 s "UBS rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We have not been able to save the UBS once again," says the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster as a result of the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and was ready to publish the data from the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the taxman perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - for repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine.
And UBS has more or less published that she had assisted in tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy has not been the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal of the leader of the Board of Directors and the Chair of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of money from customers.
And the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: investment banking because of poor speculation and asset management because of the assistance to tax fraud.
And, as there was a little calm, and as previously thought, that UBS would perform this was followed by this unfortunate history of title: a single merchant as rocketing EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank to the realization that something was amiss.
And it publishes: with risk management in investment bank this still does not work.
"With the case Adoboli, it was noted that the control of risks to too little changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich.
Also the Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of the UBS is that it was not the control of risks in hand."
However it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long since taken their function, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too many risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt & Sprüngli chocolate are for a particularly noble.
The UBS in Zurich goes hand in hand with the sound of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little more.
Already the situation is.
The Bank has its headquarters in the city of Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, rents of stores are among the highest in Europe.
As the jewellers Tiffany's are here between stores to Swiss traditions like those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: the national bank through the palace of the Credit Suisse, private banks Julius Bär as elitist.
It is in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, before are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a major label to "safe."
The UBS knows what the client research here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another ruled out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He would prefer not to read his name in the paper, finally as all Swiss bankers it does business with the two large banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, trouve-t" it - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons were also common.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And even so, they have long been adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the investment bank that has changed the Anglo-Saxon UBS, it has made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of risen as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small countries to seven million people has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs, or approximately EUR 45 billion, the politicians have agreed to save from bankruptcy the vast bank.
How could this happen?
If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially to the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks have entered into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has been steadily increasing.
On the whole, it is that the two banks prédécesseuses different of the UBS have completed: a bank rich, but lethargy with as strong point asset management in Zurich and a poor, but certainly more already highly internationalised.
Suddenly, the international investment banks have had access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team," says the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, which made its way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel has relied until the end to Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have committed at the end a fatal flaw: "It was thought that its models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly meetings of leaders in which the leader of the group Wuffli always gave the same watchword: a Goldman Sachs.
The bank was the U.S. investment bank the most powerful in the world.
It commissioned the "League Tables" the rankings, which have documented at that time the success of the banks.
After all UBS wanted to go up at the top.
Some steps have already been successful.
In case of currencies and transactions of securities it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who had the responsibility, stressed however a weakness: in the international operations of interest, in the jargon banking "Fixed Income," there would be a huge difference compared with larger banks.
The UBS would have gaps in products of mortgages.
To fill this gap, UBS has launched into an adventure, which nearly cost him his life.
Hungry for growth, it is the bank itself that a fund management created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has been a machine massive who packaged and documents of value based on U.S. mortgages - but which has also retained.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to get down.
"Yet in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. housing market was in flames, the UBS purchased here," said Geiger, the banking expert.
More euphoria is more the fall is brutal.
A manager after another had to leave, when put an end to the attempts proved to be more difficult than was thought.
Positions with UBS became ejection and are so far bancaux.
The bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all business models suggested have disappeared.
The researcher bank, Geiger has already an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of assets, return to roots.
But the bank does not (yet) go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophying vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday the Head of Sergio Ermotti bank wants to present the world its future strategy.
The Italo-suisse 51 years of age was only supposed to be transitional when the bank broke away with surprise of his predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it emerged: it must lead to the business of UBS, announced Tuesday, the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the status of the mid-1990 s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Which is it?
What does it want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He said publicly until now only that he would seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Jürgen gave his own opinion about the critical of the noise caused by birds: "this is a large number of communication, these oiseaux-là have much to say."
The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The rooks do not use only work instruments to arrive at a special treat but they manufacture their own tools as instruments of work.
The threat of the University of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, how is the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffold collapse with stones in order to achieve a larva.
Without a lot of training, they recognized that a déterminément stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, crows astute then had to solve a problem more muscular neck.
In a vertically placed cylinder, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.

The mass slaughter of staff
The new book by Peter Englund depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and grief: A History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters who you heart.
A Board to begin: tape carefully this page and make your bookmark.
You'll learn about these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in those few moments where, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a historian and journalist Swedish.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written a book of which he described, accurately, as "a work of anti-histoire."
It contains a few names, the major treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, "he explains," that a "book describing what it was like." There are "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, of young schoolgirls and botanists to stair climbing machines, doctors, ambulance and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Will lose some of its members, will become crazy or will lose their lives.
Their lives are here as the candles of a church: while some off, and new ones.
The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
Perhaps some statement to the idea that the First World War is that by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The beauty and grief" describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamia and the East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one spent Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are a problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina, which the cordite.
When its cannon ringing in the distance, and you are a mother at home, or are you staying fuyez-vous?
That will come anyway?
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for the war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, expectations, fears, ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"The beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young Marine German ports.
Their stories are drawn primarily from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details.
Most address the deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "apex, ersatz everywhere."
"Coffee, false imitation of aluminum, rubber, paper, wood."
It builds on the food replacement in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of rice cooked in fat mutton (and finished with a false bones of wood); manufactured tobacco with root dry and dried skin potato; the amount of wood."
He says that "837 meat permitted substitute are registered in the production of sausages and 511 cafés substitution."
Some stories address the honour and courage.
An American recognizes its own drive to the savagery and declared the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what the men were targeted, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a polish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no formal barbaric behind your shirt and ultra-greasy.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that it is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
"When you is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have a public."
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."
Other comments related to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition" wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the plants."
It captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and convinced ideologically, clothing well pruned, which carries out its beef while sitting behind a desk."
People act in unexpected ways; there were as many core behaviours that heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
"The most grotesque in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and" splashed on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in hospital, "he writes.
"The more desperate to apply on the eyes, resulting in blindness to life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to its task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has "triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are a war.
The best books on the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and the memory of modern) Paul Fussel, or "A west nothing new," Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is a pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning I have read in a work non-fictionnelle.
I must admit.
But it is as if it had emerged of his book, seized of your hands this page showing the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the park Zuccotti would be empty.

There could be no rehearsals d "episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the Department's regulations and have created a storm of solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean the park Zuccotti of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
"The police were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.
A crucial year was held on the island of Randall, in view of the operation in the park Zuccotti.
Officers of the Police receive better training against the riots - of anti-terrorism measures which are to quickly move a large number of police - to focus on the district of Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to travel in the park are managed "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few police officers I know and who were called did not know they would make a trip to the park Zuccotti," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones who know that they would be at the top of the hierarchy of the Department of Police."
The city has taken a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean the park but are made by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
On Tuesday the operation involved officers from various units of Police, whose task forces across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. The morning was therefore a schedule.
"It was necessary when the park was the least of people," he said.
Vehicles of emergency services equipped with spots and gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan, prior to intervene.
The lights and recorded messages resounding speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While officers in community affairs entered the park equipped with their blue jackets, many protesters have simply gathered their belongings and left.
No attempt has been affected before 1 p.m. said the Police, which left the occupants of their business.
Other teams of police officers were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present within the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman of the Head of the Department of Police, said that the measure was taken by security.
But according to many journalists, the Police would have prevented from observing the intervention within the park, seriously considered by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the Police had been moving westward through the thick jumble of cases of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags filled with clothing, teams of the Department of Sanitation, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images have been distributed on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp got together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, "said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the lock.
No arrest has taken place in the park before 3 am Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleanup operation ended about a hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park.
Most for "violating public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, Head of the Department of Police, is the highest ranking officer on trial to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, the Head of the Department of detectives, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although this did not, "operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers patientaient along the east side of the park, Street between Liberty and Cedar Street, in the event of intervention necessary.
Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
It was the Police extend well beyond the perimeter of the park Zuccotti.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, may have been seen in pushing for the people.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped at the top of a car of Police; others are starting to deflate the tires of a truck.
At a time, a piece of plywood came up in the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
The union representing hundreds of aid school who lost their jobs last month plans to initiate a trial Wednesday to the city to unnecessary redundancies and discriminatory. The impact is disproportionate on schools serving disadvantaged pupils.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, in an attempt to put a stop to layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two aid coordinators of school, parents and other employees, part of the paid less of the city, have lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political vendetta that she did not allow the city to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have to close the budget gap last spring.
Municipal authorities have denied the accusation.
At a hearing before the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, saying that the layoffs of school aid n "were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they would fulfil a notice of claim, warning the Education Department that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the department of education of the city will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers made redundant, all black in colour or origin Latin American, as most of the aid school who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has still not been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union based on the number of redundancies in schools in the most deprived areas of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that schools the poorest would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and a few sentences in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in the 23th District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts southern districts in the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the prosecution say that "This is not a district of affluent parents who can get funds to make up the difference."
The budget of the Public School 36 has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of supplemental funding for each entry "student.
The union also says that the directors of schools have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term "overshoot" to describe the action, even if "overshoot" described more generally to the action of moving a teacher in a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaints, "Sixty-six coordinators of parents have been laid off," and "not only because they have exceeded."
Mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the issue of Libya
It would appear that the Republicans and the Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the question of the uprising in Libya.
It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless but the debate on the Libya has never been simple to date.
This summer, legislators of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the role of the United States military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies has also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
The American mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory - the legislative Congress upset enough to criticise the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from underneath the foot.
The indecision of the Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and determination in view of freedom" and "congratulate the men and women of American armed forces and their coalition partners involved in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and professionalism."
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measure good all the support of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate or divisera-t-elle legislators as last June?
Senator and President of the Commission D. Richard Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the Capitol, the House must vote this week an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all of the Congress, Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have not managed to get their amendments but it is not without trying.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the only amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful who "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August was the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of Congress can be used, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is perennially proposed, as the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the States are opposed.
Also eager that have been members to offer amendments, they are not as rapid as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and 66 at the 110 th.
The pace slows in the early 1990 s, when the members were generally more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"But not massacred," says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a man shot him at close range in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic) - Arizona appeared on Monday evening in a television programme, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" Broadway and said he wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance in television news "20/20" on the ABC television channel, along with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show has touched his return difficult following the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified its recovery of "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "quite well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was held in a special edition of one hour of "20/20," issued on the eve of the release of the new book the couple called "Gabby: A History of courage and hope."
L "special program has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting of 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the initial weeks, he sits on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front.
It is to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors told him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to request to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative singing with physicians air of Cyndi Lauper Girls "Wanna Have Fun" and "Free of Tom Petty Fallin"? ."
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spent two hours each day with doctors, said that he did not recall the shooting.
According to her husband, he was read an article on the shooting of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is held at a Missouri prison and vigorously Treaty pending the trial.
"There have been many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his recovery, "said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, said," I was beaten. "
"So I would say," Gabby, you have not been beaten, "said Mark Kelly.
You just have been massacred.
And you'll get through this, restore and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity that respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the City of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on the powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines around him.
The crowd in a coat and tie was standing at her feet standing ovation.
"The men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring.
A higher-grade military present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States, has seen the role of troops in different ways.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," wrote the higher-grade military in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organisers had good intentions.
I know.
But this was not just respect. The pity.
The conflicting impressions absolutely illustrate the difficult relationships which arose between the military and an U.S. public passionate but often distant.
Praise was lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some.
The public increasingly acts as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all of the victims," said Brigadier General B. Sean MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But it would appear that the only way we support is to lock ourselves in the role of spirits unlucky."
It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not wish to appear not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of returners troops of the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on the mercy are held in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would be with respect as they have been confronted with insurgents and travelled to remote locations.
Others may be asking if "a veteran angry and violent beneath the surface," says Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work on the Government to Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people that made him the interviews were subtle if he would be able to cope with the stress of a strenuous job in Washington immediately after his return from combat.
"When you raise the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.
The difficulties of military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely pleased by a country unfamiliar with the army and who sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we value more heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," says retired Lieutenant General David Extrajudicial, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus heavily on the depth of suffering.
The troops are known for the number of services, the number of friends lost or the extent of the injuries.
The army in the face of mounting pressure of crack down on rapists
This week, a hearing will decide whether Capital 28 men and women will go on trial against the army for a China on rape.
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The soldier of 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was aged 25 and 11 weeks pregnant, the night she was raped by a soldier.
C "was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks to Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met with a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join in his bedroom to drink a glass.
"C" was a wake-up call, "says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside its concern.
I thought: no, it was 19 years ago.
"It is Texas," she says.
"I will have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the Chamber of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, by land and raped, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other members, some still in service and other not, will wait with anxiety the court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not have halted the spread of rape within the army, undercutting the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial involved 17 complainants. This number grew to 28 months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been violated or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says the military galonnées, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are individuals in a position to" eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders. "
Counsel also states that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - putting all your eggs in one basket - it will initiate several trial, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injury caused in the armed forces.
In a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel on active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 50 s.
While women have still not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction has only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with the local women.
Result: on the two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke.
It is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to his own.
In the Yale Law School, the centre of veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" awarded to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru Service Women's Action Network (action network of women military), a group for human rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December to the Veterans Administration, blaming them for discriminatory practices in the way of dealing with requests for benefits for persons have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a mixture of bipartisan senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded in the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents that year.
The report released in March is also studying the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases in the army have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants "case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she informed the Military Police of rape less than a hour after the fact.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape at different police, doctors and commanders.
It has suffered a "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of her assailant - due to a cut to his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a judge, a trial in which it raised questions about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier on the day of his aggression.
Six witnesses testified as witnesses of moral character for the perpetrator of the crime, which was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was reached," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to begin to have contractions. I started yelling at the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I exit, I remember saying to my commander" This was not his trial but my own. ""
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, which eventually diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in terms of less than honourable, to receive any benefit.
Does the case Lyman and other complainants proceed or not, that is a long history, "says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction comes between them and a verdict.
I have always criticised the doctrine Feres.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrence posed by the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... But it is important that they try," he said.
These things change only when the right have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, will bring together hundreds of other complainants to other trial.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform."
Where until we would, one of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy with his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken of a murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, has faced its first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from the be in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with a few millions of nationalist who support the far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Support to Facebook.
"We have realized that he was not that hard to find," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the Reflection Group thinktank on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, "said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the promotional tool of the site to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way marketers have for years.
L "team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that half a million members are fans extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It has targeted with advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry. Questions raised their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues interviewed 10.000 followers of 14 parties of the extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It is a new way of doing research," said Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: supporters online groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate activism online and offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
L "study DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
The focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the issues that affect the health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "I love," publications on the walls and restated articles.
With more than 800 million active users who add content on average three per day, the "supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research that the site's name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of the people that you could not approach in the street.
"Before, when you were to conduct investigations on members of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but you would have never allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and treat the health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke of their exploits on Facebook while intoxicated had significantly more likely to be alcoholics that students quiet about them.
Megan Moreno suggests that the Members of students, such as consultants, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would speak too often of alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you do not diagnosed," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and Director of the Centre for the health, behaviour and development of children to the Research Institute for Children located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and that would in another case not recognized."
Facebook also constantly access to information of its users.
L "site team that handles data studied the statistics on the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the turnout in the mid-term elections of 2010 and a national index of happiness (with the information available - only the champions of freedom digital have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to others for research purposes).
But users of Facebook know that the site notes that they like it or not - in exchange for power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres, the site is authorized to access your information.
But what happens when users of Facebook are part of a survey that they have not even heard of?
While researchers have clearly defined instructions on how to collect the information other than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a 2006 study he led by observing the Facebook walls of its students.
"They know, exchanges were seen by their friends."
And then there is the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of an user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a pad and pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with the people," he says.
"The social studies are expected to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not at a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" in his first appearance at the trial being held in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the resistance movement and of the Temple of Norway," he said before a hearing room full of 500 people.
"With respect to the jurisdiction of the court, I repudiate, as you take your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I am not pleading guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim stopped Breivik during this monologue because it "did not want to give him an opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with it a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody twelve weeks more, he was told not to talk to the media for four weeks and that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of Breivik look in the eye, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I n" was not comfortable, but I have a little progress having seen and heard the suspect. "
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at reporters and the survivors in the eye in and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the judge has determined that it was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that it has acted with accomplices.
The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which will perhaps some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons of the interview lost to Steve Jobs, film this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical innovations and inventor of the modern computer.
But what the fans of Apple may find more revealing in an interview of Steve Jobs found recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the major markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and work flow of products.
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. Identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeding of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a "disease their that suggests that a great idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a great idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than a hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
By then, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
When a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he stated that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage the director.
This video, slightly, is the basis of the 68 -minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technological and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in an effort to provide a clear answer.
There are also times when perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where he seems anxious to hear the issues of Cringely, kicking it elbow to accelerate to questions or issues of greatest importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what it sees as good or bad in other businesses and her own vision on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on the man we see here, the dreamer anxiety on the eve of the magnitude.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
It explains and then put in place.
Here's a quick summary of seven sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked:" Why are you doing things? "And the answers are always the same:" oh, simply because they have to be. ""
No one knows why, no one is thinking in depth to things in a company.
That is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs is giving details of its efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
Puzzled as to how the costs were registered - it often begins with a "standard cost" of a rule of thumb, and then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs.
On the opportunity to play a round to Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and call for free long-distance.
The device has been the subject of much written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public phone, then an appeal by linking a network AT to another while avoiding as many satellites as possible.
"We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and it was a minute later on the telephone public next door," Jobs said with a laugh.
"We were young and through the Blue Box, we learned that we could ourselves create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We do not know much every two, but we have been able to invent a small thing capable of great things. It was a lesson incredible, and I do not believe that Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices in laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love with technology (and lobbying of Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a counter, it is the number of Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20 -minute conversation, Steve Jobs is a summer job part-time in Hewlett-Packard.
"This had an impact on me." C "was the only company that I had seen in this article and this has formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the research laboratories at the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small tube. I fell in love.
The adolescent that j "was returned in HP and began to write programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim.
Early in his career, when he moved to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked to assemble a computer.
Working with only 30 days of credit, it had to take care of the assembly and delivery of devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember large disputes... I was yelling, claiming that I would have five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I am out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make $15 and which was incredibly reliable.
Large enterprises that run out of steam:
Well before it is revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share.
"Recognise that you work with IBM and Xerox, you are a better or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the company does not meet more successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [it is these types of people] that eventually lead businesses and product are available to the "gap decision-making.
The engineering product which led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could hold all the computer industry.
She could have ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90 s...
They uprooted the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge part of manual work between a great idea of an extraordinary income... As you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a great deal on its subtleties.
There are trade-offs... Some things that you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories as well.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind these (concepts) by assembling to each other.
Finally, decisions are taken by personal taste. This is to try to expose you to the best products that men have created, and try to make these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
We have always ashamed to fly excellent ideas.
It is part of what makes Macintosh. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If this is for the computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of health law while the court meets
The day the Supreme Court will meet in private to consider the issue of political discord, namely if the opposition to the law of the President Obama health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm of lawyers who will defend the case to the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges are gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases in question concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the health care reform ambitious passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument from 5 is expected in March, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilisation of the presidential race of 2012, which will be growing at the time the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and argued on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms that have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society Fédéraliste (Society), a group of dedicated to defend the legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the conference of the court on the case.
Was there, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican of the Senate and sworn opponent of the bill of health.
The featured dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Fédéraliste for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably by the Code of Canon 4 C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising organizations related to the right and although the judge may not be a stakeholder, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two law firms of the case, as well as a business with a financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court will meet the same rules for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drinking and dining and a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds of this event removes any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the criticism that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Fédéraliste.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist, specifically.
Furthermore, the Conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law have been laid in the court of first instance.
His critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that it would do so.
Boeing has a record of $18 billion for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 airliners bi-couloirs, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, a market estimated at more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is a case where the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and that the amount of these 50 had reached an all-time high of $18 billion.
Equally unbelievable is that Boeing has received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine of future orders.
In forecasts published Monday in Chicago, the company believes that the airlines of the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the order of commercial aircraft the more expensive in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai who spent this command pharaonic.
Boeing announced at the Salon of Dubai Aerospace of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order of $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air commissioned six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model which boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six "more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar.
"These clients in particular has enormous value."
In the Middle East, the oil producers have a lot of their airlines.
They have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their most important - would not if harmful since the country money would be with the rise in the price of oil.
This is important because these companies will be less likely to cancel or postpone their orders aircraft when the price of oil increases, reported Dihora.
"They have a natural hedging," he said.
The control of Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing in the market for heavy-lift aircraft and helps to attempt to halt the encroachment of the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
The victory of Boeing at the comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300 ER.
Airbus pushes its inception to increase the result at the request of its clients to increase its capacity and autonomy.
The shares of the company Boeing have increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican President clearly beaten in elections to the Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo IRP in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access to the governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and it said on Monday that drug traffickers have helped one of his opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in the lead in the race for Governor of the State of the west.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to radio in an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They took the ballot boxes, have set up roadblocks... And have forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have made little Calderon, who was in the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as winner.
Aureoles Silvano, candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, who is currently Governor, placed third, a painful defeat before the presidential election of 2012 left for this divided and unhappy.
aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the State, has denied any link with drug traffickers and he urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by the drug cartels engaged in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the "State of origin of President Calderon and chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the NAP was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have given up locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI as corrupt, that the elections of Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man is expected to represent the PRI in the run-up to the presidential, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and declared, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The exhibition urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has applied to India and China to prepare to help the euro area to get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a decrease in the long term that would prevent the development of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of LADS based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or bilateral agreements.
He cautioned the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to watch the difficulties of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and reported that a financial support Asian alongside the leaders and resources of Europe would avoid long-term impairment of the global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected until" at one point but it is not immune. "
"So if China and India can help, that there are no limits."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously skyrocketed and prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has set off the fear that the global economy is in recession, and the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag raised hopes that the IMF would any aid Asian, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - as the obligations of the financial rescue of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided a greater bargaining power to Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy to suffer a decline in exports and a depletion of arrivals of foreign capital.
"No one wants to that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have some monumental challenges to be addressed and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich European while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept assistance to Europe to 1.2 billion Indian, including at least 800 000 live on $2 per day or less.
"One day, they will find that the Greeks retire at 50 years and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will have difficulty swallowing," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of the India should be used to maintain many officials Greek well paid jobs in poorly managed that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant impact" across Asia.
The forecasts of LADS economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now "risk of loss" because of the threat.
He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed to "develop" contingency plans "to protect against an economic downturn and significant capital flight.
Severe warnings from the Pentagon on the potential reduction of defence
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, as well as the raising of civilians.
The Pentagon was already $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is concerned now that an additional amount of $600 or more cuts are imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is known as sequestration, would result in 23% of reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"A significant reduction, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our vessels and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would ultimately affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"While the funding of the accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war efforts would be negatively affected by the disruptions in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
"The Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that support the war."
"The staff manager salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and policy support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world of military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this drastic action," said the senators in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the time of the publication of the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose."
"The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or appeal to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even if he managed to the highest position of the Pentagon with years of expertise of the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
In a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could occur - a military with a shell but no core.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without bullets."
"It is a fighter pilot, without enough trained."
"This is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs who do not have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a strength depressed, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has set out specifically how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in combat operations future."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could one for the axe, including those already tested and some fair in the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned ballistic submarine, the new generation, the new warship coastline and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that this is an essential step to improve and response to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to identify a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how the deception and lies are omnipresent in daily life.
The Republican nominee Herman Cain is to exchange of allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The directors of Penn State have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports that a football coach to retire was sexually abusing boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying to U.S. President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsé countries.
The member of Congress from New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, is past for a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted by evidence irrefutable.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign finance related to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of anyone who has lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in his second term on ever his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on tests of the school and the university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have the responses by the tests students to see on their assessments of performance.
The mentors who teach the opposite should send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many let's meet deception?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies.
Another study showed that the foreign lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detect or identify lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the objective is to scream: I had, "the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities with conducted a thorough search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths on lies were all.
The liars look at you in the eye.
They bégayent turn red, or if not always.
Not to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A lie detector qualified can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions facial, training of the issue and the response time.
I spent several years to review of the scientific results in the vast body and always emerge of knowledge about the deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management.
The good liars are skilled to read the other, at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extroverts lie more than introverts, men say more lies "citizen-centred" while women say more lies "focused on other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people less often lie to their partners that unmarried (but that the lies that they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are seen as a miscreant, the other will feel less guilty when you lie.
How can you say whether a person?
First of all, observe the normal behaviour of your subject.
This is called "establish benchmarks."
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, quality voice.
You need to know if someone is normally its feet in order not to launch charges unfair when you see the feet in the middle of the meeting.
And then look for signs of behaviour misleading verbal and non-verbal cues.
Consider these indices as of red flags, not evidence of deception.
People can misleading around the upper body when trying to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, look towards an exit, change of posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult issues are.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the maintenance is completed just to seek to trigger the reaction post-interview.
Also, be careful in the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has gone wrong in the past while claiming that murdered his wife was alive, triggering a national search for the envelope.
Individuals can also use a misleading language outpaced: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat fully a difficult issue.
The indicators are the most common are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "language" at its response to a question difficult: "Well... To tell the truth... If I remember goods... To my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by con artists in their professional and personal lives.
The plan will be controversial oil pipeline diverted after the threat of late approval of United States
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - are causing the anger of unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project to the back on track.
Transcanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline from the ecologically sensitive dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill Nebraska.
The Journal of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until he received new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, extensive sources of groundwater.
"This is a very real way forward," said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environment review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as "the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support.
The 2.735 km oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700.000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have capitalized on the estimated 20 000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan that are pushing legislation to force the remoteness of the area of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Environmental Impact Statement of the State Department found that the project would only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Inspector General of the Department ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would be a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate in its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child giving out of fear
A family of New York says that the diva Patti LaBelle Disco launched in a spate of violence in the lobby of their building in Manhattan, has terrified their little girl to the point where she has vomited of fear.
The tirade of singer "Lady Marmalade" has frightened the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, to the point that it has suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of foreigners," says his family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10 November last year while the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife teacher kindergarten, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to travel as a family.
While Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk down in the lobby of their building of Boulevard Riverside with their baggage, Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk stated that it had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and told me:" do you know what your daughter? "I said" yes "and I went up," she says.
Labelle chastised anger with the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone:" You should not let your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told him:" what you say or think I am not interested in. "
She became enraged and started to use swearing - the word "and the word" "with a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to spray of water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman:" Look what you did to my daughter, "says the mother of the child.
Labelle jumped on the mother - who was always Geneviève in his arms - and had to be adopted by his entourage that has carried over to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, "she says.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but there was no answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment.
The complaint requests unspecified damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case without charge and that the family is planning to donate all the money received to charity for cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially against a kindergarten teacher, a child of 18 months."
Adversity climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations as regards the advances of the economy, but given the adversity climate at the beginning of the year, the increase was not observed in exchange, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, share of loss of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited opportunities for the state's economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments by the frozen by the Mexican Council of Rural Development Series, there was $582 million in damages 835 hectares, including a 78.03 percent suffered damage total and the rest of 21.07 percent have suffered partial damage, the major crops have been affected vegetables, corn, and chickpea.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the State in the first three quarters of the year has accelerated, because for the January to March 55 mile 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Population Economics, in the second quarter the rate is now 5.28 percent and the July to September the average continued to increase up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, up from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in the Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist López Gerardo Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained in terms of indirect actions carried out by public policy.
"That is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people with the dollars some way that this is not easy to work for the win, they invest and use it in something," he says.
Migration held

The Court valid "the analog" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog cited by the Examiner is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the last years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies made against the presidential decree that the so-called "analog cutoff" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate the have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded its powers when he issued Order in Council which details the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital television.
With this outcome, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the order, or non-constitutionalité and this continues to be in force.
The draft, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutionnel, because of the fact that the regulation of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve.
In favour of the project voted only Zaldívar, Mario Jorge Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two controversial constitutional to challenge the order and assuming the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the Order and of all the actions provided for in the programme for the digital transition.
The plenary session of Ministers resolved also dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project that the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal structure may not through general standards for the measures that the government is preparing to.
"I believe that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has the constitutional mandate the direction of the state.
The substitution of the analog by digital reported is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this is reflected in the better exploitation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
The change, has soutenu-t-il, would adjourn the benefits of the decision, which involves a public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, has souligné-t-il, "require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants the faculty of the Executive of the state."
He recalled that a large number of countries across the world have already finished the digital transition and they did it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the very specialized technical bodies.
One cannot conclude that the Commission, in issuing the decree challenged, has invaded a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere compliance with laws issued by the Legislative, assura-t-il.
The analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to data provided by PERs, the difference between the first and second place for the election of the Governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 mile 74 minutes total.

In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Michoacán Electoral Institute (AEI), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards to reform federal in electoral matters.
It is recalled that Michoacán has not licensed or its Constitution Policy or its Code Electoral Institute of State or its Electoral Act of Justice, at the same time as the Congress of the State has approved reforms to end shortly before the legal time limit for this trial electoral can enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in the time limits set by the Act of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had a few objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Authority and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reform, because it does not have the right to "punish or challenge."
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the guidelines by the Council General of EMI it will be possible to achieve the partial and total votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or several packages election, it may be that: the results of the minutes do; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the ballot box is not in the president of that company; or there are any errors or obvious alterations of minutes.
In addition, the total amount of votes received in all polls of the election will be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the assumed candidate winner of the election and the one that took second place in the election is equal to or from below by one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party and / or coalition who made the second of candidates reported.
The total amount of voting can also be achieved if at the end of the count, it is clear that the difference between the assumed candidate winner and the second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is express the petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case it will exclude the electoral packages that have been subject of the count.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia where, according to the PERs, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 minutes total.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister designated, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister designated, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put at risk all the Eurozone.
A news release of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the Government.
It is expected that it presents a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said that it would submit its report the result of his conversations with the political parties in his essay to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well established," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a reduced time more than usual, while Italy combat a political and financial crisis which pushed the cost of its debt to levels impossible to support.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy who had been affected.
Noting the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the instability of markets to put the performance of obligations Italian BTP to over 10 years of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Labour Italian Confindustria, told media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support the government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to this kind of emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti have been driven significantly by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, in which the crisis has forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right.
The support of PDL party, the Italian, is the most significant because until now many of its members had been opposed to the Government of that majority technocrat Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be reforms unpopular austerity.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and organizations juveniles and women.
It will complete its tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano Sunday, which has empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt are now at critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist up to future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians will provide only the time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only by specialists, an index of their objections before a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources reported that the mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties complicate the trial to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is higher than that of Costa Rican
Of the 22 called footballers of Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 convened by the two countries for the friendly today, at 15:05 a.m., at the National Stadium in San José.
While the national champions and Europe, the number one ranking monthly of FIFA, account for a broad range of games inter-sélectionnes Class A, the Tricolore only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, to maintain the intense activities in league championships and national and disputes in cuts as the European Champions League.
To this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the playoffs complicated the European and the World Cup football.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience to a limited area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the record of the Selection is that of the Spanish goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England in London (0-1) tied the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week earlier by UEFA alongside other century-old team Iberian plates, Ascasibar mentioned above with 126 and point at centre front of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The figure is centennial will play with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
The Costa Rican, and Michael Umana near the left lateral Junior Díaz, with 48 attendees and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with Randall Azofeifa with 31, 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, with 36 Carlos Hernández and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The national side, with less than 30 attendees, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Edder Nelson Vargas and start again.
The history of the Spain striker David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" To go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality "
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said that the group is prepared to provide one of the best concerts the next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
Is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is in the wing of its South American tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its single stopover in Central America.
That day will come on the National Stadium, from 19:30 hours, the group of Los Angeles The X and nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its proponents, the fact that Costa Rican Pearl Jam will occur at Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us.
This is the second time in South America and Central and so far this has been.
I spent to Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I think we can spend a few days.
We therefore émotionne to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most devoted followers?
Thank you to stay next to us for all these years.
It has taken 21 years to ensure that we achieve Costa Rica; thank you to wait until we regret the fact that so much time had to spend up to this together.
A few people are already saying that his concert is the largest show of the year.
Does this adds a bit of pressure to your visit.
Some of the greatest shows that we have provided over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very keen to produce.
We love this country, we like to do in the surf and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are amazing there.
My friends would always to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, to Mexico, are great places to make the surf; that is how we learned, through the UW who like surfing.
Seeing the tour, you with offered shows enormous, with many songs.
What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never products there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse.
You never repeat the directory.
What is this?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine and we can interpret more than 120 songs and love songs each different, that is why it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have more interpreted for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us the reasons why we loved these songs and that we can have forgotten.
This fact that the show is more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
With hindsight, it is difficult to believe everything that you have been successful?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I believe that none of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for over 20 years that this is a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together we émotionne much.
We love and we love to create music.
We are lucky to go places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could get better for us.
That means to you having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been a honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerging from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is a honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
Yet we play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we have seen Soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to still be friends with them all and it is a honour for us to form part of the sound of Seattle that arises.
It is also very strange that a group like the your community united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally last.
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, second, we are all concerned for others.
We are all close friends, and through this there are boulevards musical that give to each of the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music of everyone and this could go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who like your music.
If we do not forget that people are there to music, it helps us to remember that we must respect the music and what has made, without getting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really of any one of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think that we have written to good songs and early this was.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still friends with Bruce Fairweather and Greg (Gilmore) that began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
It was a human being surprising and we are lacking.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with various proposals and this was the group that we have the best, so we are keen to see what Las Robertas can offer online and it must be very distracting.
For what you always change the words of yello Ledbetter online?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
That's who sang and I believe it does with the first words he imagine.
As bassist, what are its influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember there is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the one that I love.
How Pearl Jam has managed to maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I believe that we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups that I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have all at once, and if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At first, his music was a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It is interesting, because I believe that there are songs in the new album that appear to be lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I have listened to them and these are songs deeply obscure.
I think that if you are growing and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a friend or relative, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, this is for me.
I also think that can also be pleased and even as the music can be made.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in magpies, informed her family physician.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from several conditions, including cancer of language for which he was operated on four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Néoplasiques Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, without doubt, he said that it wishes because it feels innocent.
He was operated on four times of cancer of the tongue, it has a weight loss weight of 18 kilograms, and other diseases, as erosive gastritis, a cyst, pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems of movement in the feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori is serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army who operated illegally during the first years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
A procession official, to head the Uruguayan President José Mujica, and consisting of various ministers and patterns, introduced on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, commercial, and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda by the Presidency Uruguayan.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France which took place where the representative of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement which caused the release of Uruguay and the call for consultation its ambassador in this European country.
Mexico since November the G20, a group of emerging and developed stronger in the world, and has in place with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The government has tried in recent years to send the agreements to exchange tax out of the "luxury list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not enforce all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber with the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3 D Land"
Super Mario fought, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3 D Land" will contend for the love of the young stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is this month to stores across the world, was designed to operate the characteristics of the Nintendo 3 DS console mobile, which can play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the man who must say as must operate stereo without glasses," said the head of press to Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3 D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo originally designed for this format," because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3 D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3 D" was adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3 D, "Super Mario 3 D Land" is a video game "accessible" that allows a rapid and fluid.
álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3 D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" for users less adept.
Once overcome, the experts may cause a "second round" to levels of game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose between a "D" or an aggressive which only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to plays in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also means the return of the character to a mobile console, was faring more since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo is a nod to the saga and repeats the formula for success of previous games, which is in the fact that the plumber mustachioed must travel platforms to perils to release to Princess Peach.
Even if I find developments in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "feasible."
Colom agrees with Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given the order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to meet in the United States for the conspiracy to the laundering of U.S. $70 million.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala meets at the request of the northern countries calling for Portillo is for the judge.
In a press conference, Colom said that its decision to the independence of the judiciary and executive taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his mandate "it has not helped" in any judicial resolution and it had given way to all extradition that he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano-Ravina Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has an Executive after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent of the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolved its legal situation in Guatemala City and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzling funds Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was President, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and has reactivated the case.
trinijove has helped 6.000 at-risk youth
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young without training
The results of the first 25 years of life of the entity of social support Trinijove is important: 6.000 young people at risk of exclusion received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
This is compounded by the long centenary of jobs from this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in a celebrated act in a former industrial complex i Fabra Coats which more than 300 people attended.
trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping people poorly trained, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have worked with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan regional government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and its predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall Socialist and former mayor and deputy mayor, councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Was also in the great room i Fabra Coats the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of charity La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is too, but he added that the work done to date "is a good basis."
The President has given Trinijove as an example to know the circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work that the Commission is doing," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fêtes, evacuated
The invaders had taken ownership of 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, to Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of number 51 Rue Balmes lived has ended.
Twelve people have abandoned at noon yesterday voluntarily the building that they occupied illegally and where they held micro-fêtes neighbours, who taught by judicial order and without need of an intervention of the police.
At the end of the operation has changed the lock of the door to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From that day there will be access control," affirmât the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were habités-, have won the electrical installation and part of that of water, apart from painting the walls and leave residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the masses, which lasted until two days and has the tenants.
To the side of the building there is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europa Press that from the occupation of the building his case has declined 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of ownership of the unfair, because they were selling the glasses to three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbours for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the clients of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the house and especially the participants in the celebrations held there, who were more frequent and intense the past few weeks, according to the angry neighbours of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the problems were so large that it has even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months that it "forgiving him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The Chairman of the Group of the municipal town hall, Alberto Díaz Fernández, asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to overcome the problems of life in common and good citizenship that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a floor of the building was occupied, but the last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there have been robberies.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must put an end to impunity and be implacable against anti-social behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the June (the local police Catalan) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police has shifted to the number 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people moved into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy on the fees
The competition on the 16 gates opened up the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80 s, in the height of the déjà-éteinte Corporation Metropolitan Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed stickers to promote Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that will not move on the north-south axis, if not top (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was more Central Park, with Yellowstone or wild boar on the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a composed form by 16 competition for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door to the idea of park, without a doubt.
That is, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both as regards its organization such as the reflection on the town is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme which two members of this former caste of elected speak when they themselves in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the front "there is a need to" discuss "the mountain" because the speech Ildefons Cerda, that of city blocks green was not conducted to end.
"It must start from the basis that the park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its accessibility.
collserola is more complex, "has given the verdict which the architect for the title of" Collserola "contains a" trap "lexicon: we must think about" such as access to a park, but the demarcation of areas in which we must act. "
modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils."
Of the perils that is derived from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 80 s and has been in the area of the Forum "his swan song."
The first fear is the own boundaries on which we can build.
"Limiting something means establish already the next step," that is, its overrun.
"We need to think about new planning instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can produce authentic disasters."
By keeping more to the question, Modol opine that, by simplifying, the watershed of the region to Collserola El Valles "may be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat of which "should not be lost," by thanking for the opportunity that the city hall offers corporation to intervene in this project "from the first time."
In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this profile technical must lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) of the create: "We, architects, should be only one instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition it lack a global vision of Collserola: "The was convened 16 competition - he says - in the sense montagne-mer, but there is not a reading longitudinal track and understand the area as a whole."
This fact, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competition.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the door.
In its opinion, yes, the council should ensure that the next to that of Ronda of Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that performs a soft transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgiving to Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the proxy legal Red Casino has granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal authority of Casino Red grant forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Tribunal, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red Gil, Sergio García, has published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás him the payment of a quotte economic for the mayor of Monterrey operation illegal gambling house.
After public denunciation, the prosecution has opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and September 2 he was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Officer of the PP 3 of these offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the state.
He remained for the next 49 days when he delivered a second order of detention after the agent of the PP has dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the centre of Cadereyta presumably to sing with one and a half million pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the detention centre average security because there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial contained in the cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
October 25, an order of capture was issued by the Clerk of the Criminal Tribunal Second District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was evidence confirmed sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as that relating to the collection of $1.5 million pesos representatives of the gambling in exchange to allow its operation.
On Monday, the authority's legal Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before the judge by José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore it could recover its freedom within hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Public Prosecution Department attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Gómez García Arias, asked if the injury had been recovered and that of the members of the house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer has tried not to disclose the name.
Under the file 197/2011 can be given legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently can only make no claim on the court case against it; we will ask no damage and no punishment.
After the hearing on based the statutory power of the house, at 15:50 hours the was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón.
The Clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved up to the prison's established as municipium San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been pardoned legally and his file would be classified.
It will be the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives the details of the air accident in which lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter has shocked directly against the soil in full structural integrity, without the pilot could try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the conditions of climate were adequate to fly.
"The elements that suggests that the unit was given to various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees to 25 metres where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also informed of the fact that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not report the emergence of parts on the ground.
"In a research we reported that there is no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact is presented in a structural.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transport.
The ground had a from plant of seven to 30 degrees of incline.
For the moment, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last for one year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Executive Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services was assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the State Majeur Presidential operated in speed of stern and this happened on a soft soil.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a functioning as normal at the time of the impact," he says.
During the press conference, the owner of the TBS, Jácome Pérez, has listed six important elements in the investigation.
Visual flight:
According to the normative aircraft, the flight was conducted according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports AICM mentioned in the appropriate conditions to take-off, and as the aircraft towards the border region between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low cloud cover.
Routes selected:
It is likely that "because of the conditions of cloud cover the crew has sought a height lower and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The contact details of the impact and the last registration of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the impact there has not been or loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in an area reduced:
The information available so far suggests that the impact was held on a right trajectory and lateral.
The model of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
It was not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the area when there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results from the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the work of the field were found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 mile 200 feet above sea level, the ground had a dégrées which ranges from seven to 30 degrees of incline.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was possibly thrown in along the route.
The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in an area more than the place, circled around the accident, it has not found the spread of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact was held in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
Insurance Social is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by experts in the NPI
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in the case of children and young people, known as "Genetics of obesity among children and adolescents" that will have the markers associated with being overweight.
In a news release, the head of the Investigation Unit Medical Biochemistry in Hospital of Medical Specialization Centre National du 20 e Siècle, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social.
This team is supported by specialists and students from third cycle of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre of Investigation and for Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation to be invited to participate in the population with right, or not to run for units participating sports of IMSS to Valle de México, where the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He stressed that the protocol has started in the Sport Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the business is carried out in the Sport Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of having 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unit Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sport Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and young Mexican of risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate 14 November's World Diabetes Day, he indicated that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the purposes of specific questionnaires relating to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of inheritance of their disease, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions like diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed the Saturdays will apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference measurements), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (one sought to identify the people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase, in the case of boys, from 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; as regards the overweight also observed a dramatic increase," the specialist in the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the detection of markers is based in the fact that the country's population is different from other by its history.
He informed that, on average, the Mexican have a 65 percent of inheritance US-India, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which can detect if there is a degree of overweight or obese.
Ila even said that the presence of folds (Acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of having metabolic alterations and even pré-diabètes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, physicians provide in writing to parents, which the report explains each of the measures and changes in the way of life that they must do to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: inactivity, which is the lack of physical activity daily, most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of going to foot on short distances.
Another issue is the high caloric intake, that is, the greater consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - block meat to corn flour wrapped in leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this Protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher, Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the reported that the pavement were resolved, there would be no need to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each season of rain in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera, researcher in the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, which stated that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous deck is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference A opinion on technological, organised in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which it is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with mechanical resistance greater, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this kind of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the performance and, therefore, the training of blackcurrants.
He explained that the asphalt, the more heavy oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called, and asphaltenes molecules with a molecular weight, called malthènes, which together provide the paved his characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
Viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is the fact that at temperatures, high of nearly 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C it presents a status almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day in terms of environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist chemical engineering.
The researcher to the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three imply the asphalt.
Between the uppermost layer is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stone house in asphalt and compacted later.
Each small stones that form the layer, signalât-il, is bathed year asphalt.
When the vehicle is registered in generating efforts, he allows that the forces are spread very well in the streets.
If we had of modified asphalt, they will spread better, opinât the chemical engineers.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a last layer called layer of turnover, made in gemstone, i.e., sand, which is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, she must have more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and provide adhesion in the street.
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, "he says, because they affect significantly the performance of the layer of asphalt.
When the soil is getting wet, the water runs into the layer is so that it is difficult, which softened all layers of the pavement and therefore because of blackcurrants.
In the trial of a white, he says, which is the first strike is the film and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the injury was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with maintenance programs.
The member of the National System Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market, and to repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
That has failed to Valle for the candidate to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that Melina Ramírez Serna not issue the crown of miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
The new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wear the crown of money and the band that it as new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the scepter, the amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who have found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What is he has failed? Because the result is the defeat of a great favourite that in every submission has demonstrated that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because it had not been elected in vain Queen of Police and Better Face Jolie in Vogue, obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the decision taken by the sworn to designate the First Princess is the fact that it has not satisfied with his answer to the question "? What was the book that has marked and why? By Murillo Martín Gómez, the Leamos Carreta Literaria.
This is the response of candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser definitively, I believe that the book that marked my childhood is" The Prince ," this book is a deep enough.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," this is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The love of the blood." "
This response was not the first because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly for not explain specifically how each book cited the had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt quiet and happy with the outcome "universe and wise, it is what has to happen.
And for all the world, see you a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book "
Between the assumptions set that Valle was destroyed by patronage.
A journalist from Bogota has implied that being the favourite, the highly acclaimed and the candidate who received all prices (preliminary challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best costume, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the scene."
And it noted that in his first presentation in swimsuits to the range of Hilton and two parades, the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two parades she had appeared confident even, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como in casa" (As at home), Canal NCR stated that the fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the board on its interest in social initiatives, which is, in fact, the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That is why two days before the election the juror international Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed in relation to the social needs of his country.
"Only the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the Competition are already involved in projects," he explained.
We speculate that Valle has sinned by its flaws of its behind and fibrosis who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, precisely because the board elected as the candidate Beauty "natural" with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work.
The initiator of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina had not the best body, that it was best, "but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too well known, has left marks the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the review Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were surgical procedures that she had suffered.
"The surgery are good, but Valle has not been able to do.
His body has never been its asset and she lost due to this aspect. "
For this award, that the National Beauty calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has a cruel prediction that took place yesterday evening, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of rule, not as a sovereign, if not as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competitions per designation of the National.
However, she will spend in history as one of the queens that despite its dazzling passage Cartagena, did not receive the crown.
And was the work of the person of Cali which has identified the remains of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali made history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano "."
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of terrorism: "Alfonso Cano" - testing its fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of "availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
Early in his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had spent more than five days in the forest to arrive at the venue in which the bodies that were to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after classes, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes at least for three days.
Something very important.
Friday night is party to Cauca in a helicopter Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that the suspected one of them was that of the man who led the guérrilla oldest in the world, therefore he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a doctor and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye was deceived not: it was "Alfonso Cano."
This same night, the man originally from Puerto Tejada was the responsible person who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that, yes, it was the Supreme Leader of terrorism.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopiste to Sijín of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people is not our job.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
To identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of individuals captured.
When caught, many offenders have false identity cards or have not of documents.
We take their fingerprints and are in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of flight he had to remove a portion of wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to get a safe full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints can also confirm or rule out suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently it was found a dead man, with bottles around him.
In the meantime the investigation it was determined that a parent can be suspect of crime and a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this No. not guarantee that it is the murderer, this puts it on the crime scene.
A dactyloscopiste ITC explained that is extracted "the fingerprints of objects with reagents chemical or physical."
When they appear, using a doctor or a band for the levy.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there is still a lot of Colombian without papers," said the expert of the ITC.
He explained that all is not how it is shown in the television programme CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that is is not necessarily a fingerprint.
However, it may be used, if the confrontation is necessary.
The "indignant" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters pushing and shoving each other around the place Zuccotti for camping.
A large number of people accessing the evacuation order and has moved to a park.
The integrative movement occupies Wall Street have defied the authorities on Tuesday in New York in trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters pushing and shoving each other around the place Zuccotti, where they go through a judicial order that allows "indignant" camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement has responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there have been new judgments.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will install in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," dit-un spokespersons "Held Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of "indignant" in the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "indignant" occupied a new park at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the tunnel Holland, between New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Parish Church.
At least for a time they have been able to make the place, but after the Police had travelled there and arrested a few protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figures, ensuring Efe the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had also spent handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there is for people who had installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
Meanwhile, the place Zuccotti - which is a forum for private property - remains closed pending a celebration of a court hearing under this Tuesday, during which we must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some protesters moved so far and were distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and they were the same agents who were monitoring the place, which has caused some small clashes ,"" said Bray, who denounced the fact that some official hit the demonstrators.
The order prohibits judicial authorities to evacuate Held Wall Street or to apply laws published after the start of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to regain access to the park with tents or other properties that they used previously.
The Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, which it has alerted to the fact that local laws do not permit to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor has defended the evacuation made personally to the place Zuccotti, an operation during which it has arrested 200 people and which was decided by the fact that the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming "a place in which people were to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more concerned to defend the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, which accused the mayor of "do not respect freedom of expression."
Those responsible for the "Wall Street" Held also indicated that they felt they could not organise actions of "large" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate two months of protestes, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a television programme of Noel
To Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, it will take in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," first in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now, actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special programme of Noel of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
Ctv has distributed today images of the television programme in which Anderson, known also for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of this time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in a crèche by supporting a doll representing to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appears come Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel of CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March married in Buenos Aires, the Argentine Luisana Lopilato, and which is itself not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "bitch" the American Kim Kardashian during a concert in New York.
Japan Returns after the earthquake
The GDP increase a 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption to end the spiral of decline from the beginning of March
Since March the Japanese economy was crippled, or even after the devastating earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country Japanese since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses to $300.000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to be mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falling, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page: GDP increased 1.5% from the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
That the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - requires, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of equipment additions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, businesses have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of non-interrompue increase.
However, the real challenge of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of GDP.
This variable has increased 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has recovered to the internal market when the Japanese yen - the currency - has become a "refuge" values elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and forecasts from the United States, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of export companies.
With a divided stronger, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country with a line of floating economic is determined by the health of large groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the assessment of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the outlying countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda be bullish.
"We have to follow the risks remain, as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of countries provided in September clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are constrained.
Because it dropped four decimal places up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
He has even been above the average, which is in the level 100, dropping eight decimal places up to 99.13 points.
Athens is again the doubts
Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign a written commitment
With the risk premium peripheral triggered and uncertainty relocated in parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The sensation that the "consensus" of the new Greek Government of transition is imposed by the requirements of Brussels by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no other alternative for the structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days has established in the designation may be short for application, the leader of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, provided that he would not support the new austerity measures in no case and reiterated its demand new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No. of doubts about its position: "We are committed to helping the Government of transition, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse that EU and IMF, organizations that must release the 8.000 million that Athens requires with urgency, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment of the adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by the lengths of the referendum in Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will provide assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties "third do not sign a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible."
The voice of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, even if there is a final date.
The Greek still have much to do.
The Queen Sofía: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen said the "dominant" of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain "was taking place at the global level in the role of Micro-finances."
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor in the world with regard to this instrument of cooperation that the "essence" lies in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being."
The Queen opened the V-e yesterday of the Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specifically, for the purpose of the reduction to half the volume of people with incomes below a dollar a day, which is the" poverty line ."
Spain "continues to work" to enlarge the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and undertake this task with" responsibility, "said the Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and inputs origins during the Summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many objectives" and "we we face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is intended not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which we must give "two goals."
And, Her Majesty explained that the objective is that at the end of 2015 there were 175 million poor families who have been assigned to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families out of poverty in which they live now.
The momentum in the design of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the trail initiated a few years ago in a manner" by pioneer Muhammad Yunus, "said the Queen Sofía as an" act of justice and due recognition. "
And she described the father of this instrument as a "idealistic admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," the work which it is since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to check on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I have seen a continuing evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the term "family head" meeting in Valladolid on the part of the "banking on the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofía has finished his speech by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Imperative etic"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a "continuing obligation."
Jiménez took the view that the microcredit involves "a serious political and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow it to be the victim of the cutbacks.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to persons "which excluded all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, Leipzig, was held without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program but has emerged in the fall, including to meet activists who feel the policy of the Government too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps of Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
About 1001 delegates, only nine were against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes, that was given, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, provided no room for doubt.
The main strategy of Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."
At least this is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also important.
But the milestone is made.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank based on the weight of each economy, which of course was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
To appease the climate within his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win its conference on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What does fraud represent the judgments disease?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the judgments.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a child allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against fraud and the social handouts.
And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralds an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the judgments.
First in an aim of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose to employees of the private a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure of anger, but that would be EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: officials to impose a day of waiting not compensated in the event of a work stoppage (they have not waiting period, for three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also the issue of fraud, targeting this time for work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay," warned Xavier Bertrand at the micro RTL, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of announcement seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of the fraud to work stoppages.
It is indeed the subject since 2002 of a constant monitoring and offensive policies that have most often borne fruit.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
We focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than EUR 237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation in health economics, the daily allowances accounted for 2008 5% of health spending, with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were the maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were the judgments, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have been an average of 14.5 days of absence from work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
An average that masks differences some: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the 40 000 French employees surveyed reported that they had taken any day of judgment.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the judgments were of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A 2010 study by two researchers from CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence (for health reasons or not), France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud to disease is very little in the black economy.
As to the fraud, it is only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 that the controls are systematic on the judgments of more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1.5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 made for judgments of short duration were "unjustified or too long," 37 050.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "inadequate or unjustified" on 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases "unjustified," on several million employees who had an interruption.
A figure that represents very little about, for example, to that of the black economy.
"The UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros of tax revenue per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances and, therefore, infinitely more that fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will need to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy.
That is what said Monday, November 14, the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to its unity government would not be sufficient to accomplish this task.
"To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos has projected that the deficit of the country will be reduced to around 9% "of GDP by the end of the year, up from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right wing refuses of new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, made Monday to support the measures already approved to try to find a way out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in additional austerity.
"We will not be voting in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combat the waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Has Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has warned that the IMF and the EU débloqueraient not the loan of EUR 8 billion necessary without written guarantee to all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his word was and that he was not under external pressure.
We must legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to this effect.
This is one of the conclusions of a report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this is done with a patient is found to be competent to take such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who compared the quality of the death in 40 countries of the world.
If Canada is ranked 10 th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish that most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
Overall, the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report comes to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e., the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons not competent or not consented.
On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, we would have many more cases of these excesses specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not permitted.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow persons at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalising euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled persons has less value.
For those who assisted suicide, the surveyed feel 41% that they should not be pursued.
In terms of maintaining or cessation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be included in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a refusal legally valid is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals are trained to the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians work together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, in terms of palliative sedation or terminal, already widely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already reservations concerning the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
I am Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" position experts signatories of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and would have more than 18 years ago could ask to have it assistance to commit suicide," said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
I Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
However, "in society," he says, it is bound and constraints. "
The specialist health law Margaret Somerville has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which it referred to as "manifesto pro-euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, which is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular the data in the report about the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan called President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounce a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad expressed yesterday in the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their stand up and denounce a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have taken a stand in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call President Bashar al-Assad to "leave the power" in Syria where a quarantine of civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed.
"If Bashar was dedicated to the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have resulted in failure.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot meet the will," he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey adopted a line of more and more.
The United States are on their side welcomed a "Enhanced consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime," after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey a tone increasingly hard" in the face of the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime were killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (HIV).
Two other civilians were killed "in crossfire and shelling with heavy machine guns to Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem has estimated that the country is "directed towards the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of its work, which he said was "not dangerous."
Syria "will not waver," he added, that "the conspiracy against Syria it will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "mechanism of protection of civilians" and hopes the shipment of 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for the sending of U.N. observers to help protect civilians of the crackdown on the regime which he locks himself in the "paranoia."
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to report on the implementation of the peace plan decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of the armed forces of cities in the dispute and the release of protesters arrested.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the peace plan, while avoiding any support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices Italians
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, claimed a little time for markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices," to recover the lost credibility in the last months of Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today trade unions and employers.
It should put in place a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expected that Mario Monti seeks to Friday by a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end by the presentation by Mr Monti a short list, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti said nervousness equity and bond markets yesterday, asking them time.
"Democracy, there are specific timelines" to prepare a government and its program, he said, were "confident that the markets will be patient and understand."
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern is particularly after a drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister should be designated a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "political."
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti is committed, once on board, to work to and in order that Italy "protagonist once again" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, requested including new measures.
The "boss of bosses" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, which will be seen Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "as a country that has not growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit."
Mr Monti, known for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme," the "teacher" symbolizing the challenge of "serious" and "other Italy," according to the editorial writers.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 for Euro200 billion of government bonds.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientific, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator with a nuclear weapon, "said Monday, an American NGO specializing in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Atomic (IAEA) and other documents filed by the U.N. agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA reported last week of its "serious concerns" about "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS out in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 60 s in a nuclear Soviet military in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of its society led to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It would then have cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return in Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA is "of strong indications that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system" has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but which, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin. "
The crimes and offences anti-Muslim increased by 50%
The crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or little progress, according to statistics from the FBI made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, compared with 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes and offences anti-religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased marginally to 6 628 cases, including 47.3% driven by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," said the human rights organisation Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a news release.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, and all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said one of the managers of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he says, believing that this could be accomplished by improving police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in the U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now.
Twitter changes its platform and is more similar to Facebook
The site of micro-blogging Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, to its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which resembles a little more to that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" to track more legibly, direct the activity of other "Twittos Internet users," which follows the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows whether they forwarding messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have any messages, etc.
This new formula for Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being released to the whole network Monday, told AFP the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation, with little instinctive terms somewhat esoteric (RT to rebroadcast a message of someone else, followfriday\ to recommend to follow another user) doing the happiness of insiders, and opens to a wider public with nothing more comparable to the general public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users were suddenly of "tweets" decided on the merits of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary, intrusive, and it is too similar to Facebook," wrote @ jemb123.
"The functionality Activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream," wrote @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Recording of a "golden rule" budget in the constitution
The government of Christian Democrat / Social Democrat coalition in power in Austria decided Tuesday to enter in the constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce public deficits and avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who has even announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered only one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest in addition each year," argued the Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is responding to a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro area of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had claimed the listing by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value.
The system introduced by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year of 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, beginning in 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states as well as the Commons will be required to submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to increase by 2020/21 public debt under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threat of a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would once again in the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to rise.
"We will do as we did the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, "said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold heavily yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record of 1945 relative to the dollar.
But the yen is regularly picked up since, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose Tuesday below 77 yen and the euro briefly fell below the symbolic 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The outbreak of the currency Japanese exports of the archipelago as it builds the cost of products Made in Japan and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert in national currency.
"Japan struggle to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeastern), pointed out that Mr. Noda is concerned that the rise of the yen kills the egg in the fragile recovery.
The world's third largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the quarter précédent- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption sealed by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the high cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic foundation of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Board of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken the "appropriate measures," suggesting that no additional monetary easing was to wait until Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the central bank has increased by 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bills, to 55.000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of securities financial various for flooding the market with liquidity.
Euro area:
Rates going up, the collapse
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis mine always the European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rate of fragile higher.
Always worried about the stability of the euro area, the European stock markets sink in a little more negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt, London 0.4% and 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the bond yields of euro zone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker in IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn, renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the trade will continue in a corridor of narrow as investors will not have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, decreasing by 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the political party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion introducing the possibility for a country struggling to get out of the euro area without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish well over 6%
The borrowing rate of Italy and Spain remain at levels very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds to 10 reached 6.85%, Spanish maturity of 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to support the concerns of stakeholders.
The leader of the future government Italian Mario Monti has claimed time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has, however, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October would be the "primary task" of his government.
Spain is in the line of fire of the markets, while held Sunday legislative elections in the country.
The rate differential ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Pending the growth figures of the euro area
Statistical side, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by private consumption.
However, the INSEE revised downward the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And, it is the fourth most economists.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must outweigh the dogmas
If there is one subject that cannot treat based on considerations of short term or under the "emotion, it is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of the electricity directly affect purchasing power and on the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election date is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the role of nuclear power.
The debate will be successful only if it explores all of the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, the demographic change will result in a doubling of the application of electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, we must address the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce the electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a subject disappeared from the debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon the use of nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, who submits his motorcycle to the need to find a source of replacement able to substitute for, nor of Switzerland, who intends to just stop the building as of the latest generation of nuclear power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima have decided to add an unit to their park in the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality has the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the price of electricity, energy dependency aggravated by the increased reliance on imported gas, especially Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal.
In a few months, all of these adverse effects are already taking place.
The case of Denmark is to entertain.
European champions of the wind, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of the wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice d "electricity 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial plant on the national territory, French companies benefit from "the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear would result in a substantial increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory fine words on the redevelopment of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French are unwilling to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, the polls show.
The energy policy of our country helped build an industrial sector of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs.
Export oriented, it results in a galaxy of specialised SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing to nothing the EUR 6 billion annual export French d "nuclear equipment and services.
What would an electrician PRT designed to operate sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of electricity production "miracle, any more than there is of evil.
The development of Areva solutions low-carbon CO2, nuclear and renewable, testifies to the complementarity of sources of energy.
For the nuclear, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security control uncompromising and transparent on existing plants as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal operation; he remained without a human and environmental.
In Chernobyl, the reactor design and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy.
Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw the lessons of this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
Fruit of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and manufacturers French and German, the PRT presents a design make it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is regarded by all the electricians who want to build a powerhouse, the judgment of its construction at Flamanville site would be a magnificent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF leaving the way open for leadership in the development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotion, dogmas and the partisan tactics dominate a debate as instrumental to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles -engorgement police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is administrative harassment for foreign students who was in the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France "has no need of foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely analysed in economic terms.
Is that there is on this subject a fairly broad consensus between left and right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who said in 1976 that "900000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the poverty in the world in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left and right.
For the two sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we only be prepared to grant towards immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to the trivial, indicating that the co-development will solve our problem "migration."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be charged electorally; but it is economically very costly.
As the recall economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, pp. 352), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, salaries and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restrict immigration anemia growth and employment.
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may be a substitute for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to domestic wage earners, for most of the trades in areas of shortage of employment.
Immigrants low-skilled work in areas that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic in which training is not following the availability of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon will be difficult to work in a country that suffers a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of national.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows resulting in an increase between 0.6% and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prize American; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to, at the beginning of the mandate, the points of growth "with missing teeth."
The teeth, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, indeed suggests European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a rather fragile.
The European continent should remember him that, having invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, has experienced in the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also in Spain Franco, Salazar in Portugal, the Colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise in the most direct manner.
We know, since the "Little Napoleon," that this was a facility of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" as used the philosopher Etienne Republican Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, of the Enlightenment, of solidarity, economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is just as important and a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie of the Greek referendum will have had in this regard value of double revealing: that of the need for a return of policy, but also the sense of his troubling inability, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of combat democratic are today displaced, and that, for many, the Republicans are more in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to demand a succession of national referendums, organized an ad hoc manner and in a disorganised manner.
A blank cheque to the absolute monarch or an European jumping feet into the empty nationalist withdrawal: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to all but a year, common, as of right, calm and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - cannot be more where l "stop list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe which pander to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage.
There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because that is all that Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, break free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The crisis exit will involve decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fought this proposal of Socialists and of Jacques Delors, everyone is asking for European economic government.
.
But the think without political integration and more democratic, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We have a new stage of European integration.
For the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" of Republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political front, a genuine popular sovereignty.
For Europe, of Europeans.
Smart cards "no touch" spreading
The global smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate optimistic.
The year 2011 is expected to complete on a 11% increase in global sales of smart cards (bank card, with telephone SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart.
The largest technology without contact which allows for the payment of public transport or resolve its purchases as simply a card for a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold across the world, up from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global market for smart card (6.925 million cards).
Long the world of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75.000 payment terminals.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400.000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But large surfaces are working extra hard.
Carrefour has issued this year and 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To go up a gear, now that the banks and their customers.
"Two major French institutions are committed to disseminate to the future systematically to their clients of bank cards equipped for the without contact," Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing the payment by mobile
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Little devices today are equipped with technology NFC (Near Field Communication) essential to complete transactions.
"They have fallen behind."
"But they should finally have a real growth next year."
"We are building on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test from December to June next to Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a carrying case authorizing payment without contact.
The PCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday prepare the placing on the market of an offer to its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now "satisfied."
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without explanation.
Paris seems to be a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time that several of their abductors during an operation by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the investigators French and Niger were to find several phone chip belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
Analysis of calls made to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a man who has spent in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It is a step forward but it certainly expect more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"We know for years that the sect has been receiving financial support and intellectual external and that it is becoming more active," tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in their operating procedures, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and of the same material as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated little of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and UQU09Z10L019 fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - Hausa means "Western education is a sin" - calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is politicizing and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists committed the fight against the central government of Libya.
These are intended first churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, militants from Boko Haram were particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested living, was killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalise and leave its fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, it claims an attack which killed 80 people in Jos, and another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram is to secure the police in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria is now all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, that the Somalis al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all information."
The world according to the Republican candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry vying to oversimplification and ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters may believe.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other a thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often not supported - abound.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party," has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and the need to question "for manipulation of their currency," a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of whole swathes of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the calling of a trade war, "he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China of Obama and only candidate to have a vision of foreign policy, has failed to strangle an attitude that "dismay" the emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who sits in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
The image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will leave Iran," he off. "
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, a lack of embarrassing files.
Recently, he called to address the threat of Chinese military because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China holds the military since 1964.
The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, is prepared to engage the American army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry, and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president retorted that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to put water in its wine Anti-Terrorism Initiative.
They rightly stress the failure of its dialogue with Iran naive, on the departure too rushed "boys" of Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, and a sticky label of low.
But the attack is not so easy.
The judge rather positive assessment of national security for Obama, who has eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to inertia.
And, on the grounds that it is economically rebuild America to resurrect his leadership, Obama appears more fair.
The Nord Stream, new door / Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event.
More than 500 guests including four Heads of State and Government have participated, last Tuesday, on the banks of the Baltic, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the network there.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km linking the St Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of any French consumption.
And there is already talk the opportunity to build a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this enormous site has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding land by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it makes it more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to deny it access to European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet Pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland, in 1939.
That is, if the topic is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this project Russian, earned greater security of supply.
But it is the price of a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between people of Eastern and Western.
Russia has been able, in five years ago, to its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon opening this pipeline, demonstrating how close the major gas contracts are also political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is steel wrapped with concrete to protect against the anchors of vessels.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
For the building, it was necessary to avoid areas of mines from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
It took the measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake to heavy metal, such as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: neither valve, or station maintenance.
A platform of control was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project have renounced while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Crown corporation Russian permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas content in the pipeline is therefore in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have provided the welds for a leak every 100 000 years.
Monitoring the condition of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for external monitoring, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
Of the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, large one metre in diameter, and it is driven by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 metres, the second book detailed information on the potential distortions of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate fifty years without the slightest compensation.
The gas flow is simply provided by the pressure.
It is 200 bar at the outset, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
Have joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), and the Dutch Gasunie and French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then leased to the company, for twenty years, all of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas really transported," says Jens Müller.
The funding of the construction of the pipeline was 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pine.
Valves, high of 4.5 metres, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature, and the specific characteristics of the gas that is, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas for each hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Boots, a mark.
It created a couple of years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has an air of adventures, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its coverage, its rectangular black elastic, the leaves of a colour off-white, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine as we know it today... Was born in 1997.
The Italian company simple simple, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, the launch of the new product.
The book is based on a former technical production, the mole skin (skin of Townsend) which means a cotton varnish used to cover benches for example.
This type of book was very popular writers and travellers.
"New updated version of an old and forgotten, who was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the mark in modo simple.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
It is far from the production version of the early years, where only 3 000 books were designed.
New exceeds the Italian borders and exports in 70 countries, of France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a composite drawing of the purchaser, because the notebook seduced both the make entrepreneurs "that the student and professionals.
The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and grown.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, has almost 100 today and has since 2008 of two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, the small shops downtown and has been able to impose its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need new writing, despite the growth of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This signature cultural accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched a "Detour" where architects or artists expose their own book.
In August, it has also launched a leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine managed to diversify products: bags, agenda, pens, covers computer ... The mark takes on a wide range of media.
A success that has made envious: in the fall of 2006, simple simple was bought by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers is so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are in search of work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
Discouraging?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of disabled. "
"The progress made since fifteen are considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times."
"It is still a great deal to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, many barriers still exist prior to employment.
They are older: 37% are over 50 years (17% on average).
They have a level of qualification: 80% have not tray and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
In short, as many criteria that are making the return to employment, and that is the crux of the problem, "according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Springboard, an association established in 1992 to help companies to recruit workers with disabilities.
So much for the brakes objectives.
The rest unsaid, attitudes are changing that, yes, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre Precinct indicated that managers surveyed have "low levels of knowledge of disability," with a "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, deficient mental or intellectual."
Outcome, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objective of employment of 6% of workers with disabilities, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest figures available, dating from 2008, point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre White, Director General of the;, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence: the number of institutions "taxed," just as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre White. "
"But this improvement also reflects a real gesture of awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ workers with disabilities, against 82% of businesses in 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "That of happiness'
Prior to face the Blues on Tuesday evening (20 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have not hidden the pleasure that provides this friendly match.
It will not go so far as to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting together on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the breeder Belgian has high praise to do about it.
"I am very pleased to be Eden, its progress and for the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the organisations.
On the contrastre between its benefits in club and selection, "this is a brand, if justified."
"A Lille, I am all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Spared against Romania Friday evening in preparation for this match against France at Saint-Denis, Hazard is to "shine."
Without fail, however, the concept of "fun."
The Blues, it encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been bear," he says.
Inevitably, it contributes to further strengthen the bit of "character" of this meeting.
Moreover, in the face, "there is Debuchy (Mathieu), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil Rami ," rapelle-t-il.
"We sat just now."
"Power play against them, it is that of happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens spoke of "pride."
"Pride," "an exhibition match."
"Pride" also to see - quality "neighbour" - that France is "once again become a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the trauma of suggestions for follow.
"Laurent Blanc has made a work of thunder," he enthused.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians become major," he said.
"It is in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will realize this at future matches." That against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento begins with many of its optimistic dam return with regard to Bosnia (22), on Tuesday in Lisbon.
The move, the two teams had been realistic.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento is already, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which is to throttle since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to destabilise.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears clear that the games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than a hour, but he was unable to score that goal if valuable, which would have relieved.
"It is a good result, which is not without some risk because we don't have the goal out"
But at home in their light the Stade de Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of, before an audience that should also be boiling, even if the party is obviously "very tight," by one Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident to take over," said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," has put the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The zero reported Friday in Bosnia requires the Portuguese to mark and win.
No one may be sufficient to Bosnians, which also need to mark.
"It is a good result, which is not without some risk because we do not have to purpose outside," Bento regret.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualifications," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of entry to a maximum of pressure on the Bosnians to "not to give them time to think."
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
