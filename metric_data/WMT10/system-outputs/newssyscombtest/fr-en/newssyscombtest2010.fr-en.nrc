A lack of snow in mountain .People hoteliers
Tracks deserted pose no problem that operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow deters people skiing to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to unearth Chambers free for all dates in winter, including Christmas and the new year.
We have a lot of hits on our Web site.
Internet users roam the offers, asking prices but dare not commit to set aside for the moment.
And if they call us, they call immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin jandura, operator of information portal spindl.info.
If we are to spend the new year of his dreams to špindlerův mlýn, better not too shy to reserve.
If it gives priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation comes next, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers of špindler do not propose for the moment that stays a week for the new year.
I think they will try again a moment of the place, but they also assign them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said jandura.
The agency's tourism ingtours vrchlabí also proposes yet beds free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we most interested at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays of less expensive, "said the director of ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency tourism vrchlabí may also propose the new year to krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
14 days of February go equally well, the winter trips remaining sell moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow krkonoše.
People expect that it will start to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel horizont Pec pod sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few last place for the new year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays in January and February of Poles also sells well, "informs Karel Rada, director of best hotel of PEC.
Omnia Hotel parking near the central jánské lázně is also to eighty percent during the period of the new year.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel jánské lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is slightly lower at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest stays in krkonoše grows still certainly indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik sporysch.
Hotel owners of krkonoše must not, however, expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there are any precipitation, they should be snow in the mountains.
But subsequently, the time should warm, informs Jiří jakubský station Hradec Czech HydroMeteorological Institute.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the hard effort with which Barack Obama, president the reputation of sage, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he regarded himself as simple.
When he was eventually leave sweat its doctrine if eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario Bush of three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times the expression "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the Bush to send reinforcements in a new Iraq burned by the civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came to the recommendations of commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left his successor a final situation much more favourable than might be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle is going to happen again
Again, the commanders of campaigns that have called for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley mccristal, which has even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extricate the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it had over 10,000.
This brings the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama appears to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and complete the whole process within three years. The entire doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase in half will bring the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the opposite - we cannot rely on person and no Treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although officially based, would remain as a smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex balancing the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity on the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act", which is the purpose of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and outside reality can be confident that small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for "prompt return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is changing events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and enhanced penalties have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will cause a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for it to work on a new strategy, in case it would prove to be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses in cash
Employees senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to strong criticism about its pay practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they will not sell for five years.
The actions may be withdrawn to leaders in case they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs arises and leader of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that must be taken, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after being set aside nearly $17 billion in premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, total premiums likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday it would affect a single fee of fifty percent bonuses bankers in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year the women received the Nobel Prize in all areas except the physical
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider were received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for having clarified the structure and function of the ribosome
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been a winner this year was the physical.
The prize was awarded to scientists today Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecwillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of financial reward.
It reached 10 million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward them.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been submitted this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his journey and that it is in addition to the head of a country engaged in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy he added that in certain situations the war is essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus called the Château
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, further deepening the crisis in the public finances.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota wants to then discuss its Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies has validated Wednesday the proposals of the left with regard to transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats, the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future cabinet Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, čssd and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as voted by members, removes the package of measures for savings spent by the government of Fischer and which must according to stem the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who may ratify the state budget act but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of "disability lust" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, not a solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if he could rely on a wider consensus of the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas ètk stated that the idea of an administrative Cabinet supported by the čssd, the ODS and Greens clearly does more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of verdicts "drastic".
The head of čssd Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday, the čssd called the successful ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also fulfilled.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the principal roles are played by actors Americans, South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus - unbeaten will present to the world a lot about the country, his battles and his victories.
The story talks about sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, actor American rewarded for an Oscar, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that it is a Mandela aged 91 years who requested embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays another role.
I told him: "If I must embody, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor seventy-two years old who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama limited dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery itself become a slave, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and also important for so many people that is Mandela.
The South African state ex-homme was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the team of South African rugby François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He was persuaded to join his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players that outsiders are among the highest in the world.
The South African team will increase in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on a large screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the closest to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me this was of course to talk like it
The actor said that if he and international political rights were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national team of rugby in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle of hard rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the House, I was open and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have the air much greater in the film ".
Despite the differences between actors and models Invictus real, under the leadership of the filmmaker Eastwood has received positive opinion and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The critic of films Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "This is a very good history, a film very well done."
In the evaluations of films on the site RottenTomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive appraisals.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a rocket
There has been a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch has been a failure and the missile Bulava "type" which was originally the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during tests of the rocket did not have the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava has not soaring, or it is damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile that do not steal"
A missile that do not steal, but shining
This 13th test took place in early.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage on the apparatus.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" was exploding nuclear submarine Dmitrij donskij who was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired a boat and submerged
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the Bulava was likely by a "defective".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk about absolutely failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage was confined to the third.
In previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of nearly 50 percent therefore fills the generals of optimism and they therefore always that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclear cores hypersonic a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary fetissov to 51 years has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The defender legendary Viatcheslav fetissov will again in a professional match to 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will assist his team from CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during the match Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, which ended his career to forty years in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis kuliash we urgently need another supporter.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to resolve some details on the form, says the coach of club Sergey nyemtchinov, cited by the agency AP.
It was not clear whether the comeback of hockey legend will affect only one match.
I think fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental well-being of other players, indicated nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of her return on the ice, fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary attacking Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and received 15 goals and 26 attendance.
The oldest of the famous quintet fetissov, kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, calculated is one of the best players and among those with the most success.

In the second part of his career he harvested tributes also in NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member since 2001 the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the plant Hyundai of nošovice agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions have declared a state of emergency Monday strike.
The spokesman Petr vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The leadership wants to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot renounce our plan of production, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said vaněk.
The site sedmička.cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus CZK 400 employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also has a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours and more, or they may pose a replacement leave on December 28 and extend their holiday season aindiqué vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will be compensated for costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and hot in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the car plant were forced to work almost daily two hours of overtime in addition to their eight hours.
Unions have cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The negotiation between the direction of the car factory and unions must take place Friday afternoon.
The Labour leader Petr kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in the event of an agreement on their claims and signature of a common document.
The situation in the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so-called hazing.
The directorate has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to complete the imperatives of car production.
With the announcement of the strike Monday, unions have also requested that employees who ceased production from being subjected to any sanction.
The unions want the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for them.
The automotive plant Hyundai of nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "resilient" also
A team of scientists Czechs and Germans is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the substance improved is that she is also on the viruses that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
That reality is, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination is not acting as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
It can nevertheless be radically extend the life of patients via a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Their use is a series of side effects.
In addition the suppression of this effect is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs do have more effect.
The work of the experts of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes affect the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the Cobalt.
A virus traitor and tough.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the protease of HIV, there also will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A somewhat lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances proteases of HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical medicine, however it does not weaken versions resilient against which medication currents are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to look more towards the development of effective medicines against HIV, says pavlína řezáčová, director of the laboratory of Structural Biology Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" ratified the budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The prime minister has described the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The voice of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative Cabinet supported by the čssd, the ODS and the Green Party did more clearly.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday, the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed amendments to EUR 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased the money for salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The grievance to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as an amended budget is a variant least bad that a budget of acting.
Disappointment and unnecessary
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his duties in the event of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment Monday with Prime Minister after its passage to the government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to tackle the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of čssd, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS is not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing detrimental, stressed Topolánek textual in a communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of some departments have top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of leading a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the house."
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of Democrats.
I was not thoughtful and once that it will be on the agenda when I devote said, since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin barták, elected government precisely by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS is back at the request of the prime minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time as the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget Wednesday if he had not expressly asked members Democrats allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered criticism from the chairman of the party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation house and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules the čd there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
The Czech railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and will instead some others.
The coverage of transport will fall on the date of entry into force of the new schedules of two per cent today.
Most of the charging will not change, including basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava who will have more routes to the capital, the railways will add a Pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - písek - České budějovice, Direct Line Prague - letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, Prague and its environs can celebrate an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Mr - České budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - písek České budějovice - will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the major transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line of milovice in Prague: at the moment the inhabitants of milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of suburban Esko system, which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and milovice.
The lines distant to the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha hlavní nádraží).
The čd will introduce more lines between Prague and Ostrava and SC Pendolino trains bound for šumperk/jeseník depart at intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up to Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Department of Transportation and will contribute to the railways next year in all four billion crowns to address the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day čd net and the Internet eliška tickets at reduced prices.
For travellers without a map of reduction, the price of čd net increase of 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of newly eliška will depend on the distance travelled, whereas previously it was valid between towns in a region to choice and was a single tariff of 160 crowns.
The Filipino rebels still retain more than 50 persons, children were released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some pupils from a primary school and their teachers.
It is the agency AFP who informed, but who spoke at the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as a teacher.
The taking of hostages held in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields during a leak to the police.
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused when a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November election related to the administration of Governor there avait30 journalists.
The governor of the province of the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the lineage of influential Ampatuan.

The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in cinemas in the US in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title is Czech INVICTUS: neporažený narrae), and part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of fighting against apartheid world famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 to mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations because it is presented at a time when a hand South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are troubled by worrying news about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the agency pa, reactions to the new film are rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "strutting" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover its energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if it has the opportunity to remember via the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this applies to each individual he added.
The shirt of the national team of rugby
The film based on the story of the novel to the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. in the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room who gave his creation to the South African people portrayed the defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between dressed the shirt of the South African national team on the lawn of the World Cup, that South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been standing ovation there are fourteen years mainly white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the Football Championship will unite people again in a single nation, indicated the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South African tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical as recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on 11 June 2010.

According to lukáš Marvan, spokesperson fire ústí, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They were originally let the processor is consumer, but they have reviewed their opinion and extinguish the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short-circuit the processor.

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire was extinguished.
According to mandátova, the processor destroyed will be replaced by a nine.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the company čeps has experienced anything similar and that incidents of this kind are isolated.
Electricity supplies had not been interrupted, said the spokesman for the Society for the Northern Bohemia ČEZ soňa holingerova hendrychova, the functioning of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire station transformation.
A.S. čeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory sets of transmission and power lines 400 KV and 220 kV.

Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of čssd
Radim jančura, owner of student agency, will file today complaint for defamation against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Švejk region of South Moravia, against Radko martínka region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin tesařík.
Jančura stated in dvacet UNMIT of radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have come to sign long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three have attacked and noted that the fine hydrants, while it has only made an offer for what they wished themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech railways which is not true, because we know the price of Czech railways that were signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society student agency, said jančura in radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region has conducted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Švejk considers that the complaint of Mr. jančura represents the result of his media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call upon the other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to demonstrate clearly that it is precisely Mr. jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Švejk
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that mention the unfavourable regions.
He told radiožurnál that it suspend the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to jančura, such a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to jančura threats of a member of čssd.
The only threat was that if it did not stop, we could lose our licences of buses.
It is presented as MP čssd, I do not know who it is, but I would not say his name, said jančura today at radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some voices already, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The Pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay health insurance.
The experts also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccine for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcal free.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination began last year or earlier, it will have to pay yourself vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal.
But parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year insurance spend 300 to 450,000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
They save on medical care that children not vaccinated would require.
So far the state spent approximately 500,000 kronor per year for the vaccination of children.
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumococcal cause inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including the inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
Surveys in hospitals, there have been 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on any obligation of vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Association nahlas Rudolf kalovský indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal.
At an international conference in which our Association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination optional.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that it must now follow said kalovský.
But the Department of Health is not to modify the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We are definitely not for the time being, said his spokesman Vlastimil sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana cabrnochová, president of the company of paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccine based on volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, we could envisage a decline of renewals vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they save on possible future medical care.
Physicians will buy their products themselves
This, however, is linked to concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some members, however, feared that this would allow insurance "deduct the amount of health insurance".
Thus, physicians will buy the products and expect that insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, paediatricians individually will invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
That will be far from easy, according to cabrnochová.
Still, and we
Islam can it be?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), a study of elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided the country and concern over the past 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book weft of Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not wish to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now in France this Quem. Bozen calls "Muslim" spaces for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a un-Islamic?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interest for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They did not grow the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers an Islam Tehrik purist associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the intellectual elite Guardian if virulent of secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make compromises history with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrow key values".
Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest of the world for
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice are melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and new fishing sail in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of history and complicated policy of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence by Hunting polar bears.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
Young Cubs captured while they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrates 75 bears brought together at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface to an adult freedom. the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became Green because of algae that grew in his thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and Indians Inuit jet-skiers use powerful fusilsd'assaut to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is the most in the waters north of these two nations of hunting that ICE will remain the longer.
In his new book, "after the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes or oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late 19th and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first report on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines of the cold war were then mapped changes sous-celle relief.
Surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping out in the cold.
Mr. Anderson, contemplating the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressed by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

Marine, among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class de'angello Robinson, 19 years, made a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina cemetery at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was devoted to pay tribute to the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I try just to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, in Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize celebrations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (of Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all the other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville national cemetery enarkansas in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 to shanksville/pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the foundation Walmart Foundation has given more than 150,000 in 2003 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers have market between lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose of ancient tombs dating from the first and second world war, as well as the Vietnam war, because they are not as often visited the new graves, said organizers.
The mood was optimism, while children played and couples hold hand, bearing the wreaths on the graves of fresh pine grey.
Each round crown had a dark green with a small red knot butterfly on the top.
Close, hanging the silence on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of their current wars.
Individuals crying without hiding, praying and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others have looked to see small information cards in black and white, pushed the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of his son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and led eight hours to come and visit the graves of Marine Sergeant gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget through what we are free … my son has paid for it, she said.
"long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
A US national order by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The National, which has not yet been identified, works for development alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to access the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a approche"douce "to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptop computers are allowed to Cuba, although consumer goods and new desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Just this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for textos or for a 15-minute conversation which corresponds to a day of salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans wishing to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said it could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be permitted -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas group Human Rights Watch, who has recently published a report severe on freedoms in Cuba, appelé"nouveau Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace his elder brother Fidel, Ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that the case would demonstrate a significant network of recruiters of terrorists scouring the Internet for young men radicalized.
Investigators have said they were hunting a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after they discovered when one of them has commented approving the waves terrorists on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret services Pakistanis who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the mountains northeast prohibited became a haven for terrorism.
They have been identified as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and they always tried to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry in the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- stress the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for infiltrating men in the al-Qaeda network.
Recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment, and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow his recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen require an "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on climate negotiators working in the Palais des Congrès Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 personnes,mais 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists had lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little has happened during discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have market by the city, deploying signs in English saying 'there is no Planet B "and one in Spanish, saying" the Earth said she had enough ".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the divisive issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change occurring already. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word out and to launch an appeal to world leaders to make fair decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they wore a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who were wearing masks and black clothing, have lit several explosives near the main canal Copenhagen that is surrounded by some departments.
They threw near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "a few large explosions".
Within the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to keep walking, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators had failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China to the climate.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "in fact, this is something that I did not have a conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I can't hear what is happening outside".
He observed that the procedures might be harmful or helpful outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "You can also say that they disrupt negotiations or they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent gaps between races.
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind the lead institutions, the report shows that the grade 4 and grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the persistent gap between results of African-Americans and whites, both at local and national level.
The results means of white children in grade 4 (CM1) to washingtond.c. have increased over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only a point, from 245 to 244.
The average score of White was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of grade 4 (CM1), when the first report was published, NAEP district was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed the concern that rising celebrated by the director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown related (Democrat), board member of D.C. and whose daughter is in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see positive signs and I respect.
But fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the district should continue to find better ways of meeting the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, Wilson reading system, aimed at pupils in classes at the end of elementary school and early college who have not incorporated the basics of reading earlier in their education and who are fairly behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics, for grades kindergarten (tongue) to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the district by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which must also be credited to the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we need to continue to work to provide better services to these students below the level of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less success in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who is studying the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political implications that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other superintendent of schools, she tries to use the middle class whites and blacks.
Our focus is to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, be assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the keys to reducing the gap of success deceit duration of traditional public school today, 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
There must be some 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the Union of its teachers last year for 185 days, which it considers a "starting point" for a further increase in the next contract.
The higher education a promise of future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, falls and blinks an eye at the sight of white columns, facades of bricks and rolling lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àel Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in grade 8 (4th) of the group have explored Gettysburg where fees are $38,690 per year, his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
This is where I will study Super! exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide heading toward the entrance of the building of science.
Ya, really? says pensive, when told the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had fully integrated the message: the issue is not whether you go to university:
The issue is that.
Although this issue is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents who have left the Lycée where Hispanic immigrants have become parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to enjoy university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the Lycée -- a significant achievement when you consider that both of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way to future generations that will play an important role in the workforce.
Researchers who study the Wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set lofty goals to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to arrive until the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia gándara, researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied the Latin American students.
We must look to provide a support network for these children from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that supported the visit universities Graciela is a good example.
Known as the gear up preparations (Toi), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize programs at the university that begin when students from families with low incomes are in middle school (College) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent falling at the university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been successful in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies of chine,russie and Europe are poised to play a major role in the recovery of oil from Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
US companies are divided with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had been an auction has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies that pave the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will be a long time before another offer be made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability while American troops withdraw have hindered US oil companies, preventing them from entering with greater force in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and that were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The most important U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and brought their technical advice, are divided empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more outbidding contracts that other societies and is left with significant shareholdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological strength, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
The companies submit pre-selected for auction bid which were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda have been killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week reported Friday, U.S. authorities counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-somali was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They drove a car White, moving towards the Afghan border, where the car was struck, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority reported that local activists suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body totally ragged".
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American counter-terrorism officials have given unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers of al-Qaeda military officials running terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic direction of the leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If her death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or Taliban leader the second killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, approximately six operations per month to two, according to the figures given by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy in Kabul retired
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extent during the presidential election supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but it has expressed concern about the timetable for a US withdrawal of troops that would begin within 18 months and which would oblige the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he does not simply resigned but that it would respect the commitment that he made to his family in March, not to spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Officials say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was cited; it is a citizen Italian-Swiss who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the UN.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, to support President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- "harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of elections".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations UN hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the UN are such that I have not been able to hire one since May, he said.
It is enormous and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must be additional sanctions
The defense secretary, Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant" additional sanctions on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a lawn of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such a dénouement.¨
One of the things that weighs me the most, is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the side unpredictable inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that target Iran's political and military elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions may also affect the Iranians of the street.
He stated that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly 'of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be distant attempted agreement - in part, say the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the tightening of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of sanctions significant additional cons Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increasing sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what she called "unsubstantiated allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late on Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish officials to derencontrer troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq, particularly in the Borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays all of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm anxiety concerning the withdrawal of the Kurds outstanding. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your safety, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster of the lecturing, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby in a tomb in addition".
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; the response has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all of our time and energy to a single child.
We are left with no second, said Wang, age 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the "one-child" policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the wealthier coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, those aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning) stated that the fertile couples had to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "as old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive measures
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous tendency for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys to girls - abnormally high.
In recent years, the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have provided most of the exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of towns, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and woman are already unique children -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples at home, and slipping leaflets under their doors.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
The head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing,
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the district more urban reported that there was no change.
The municipality of huinan, with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, for example, is not always that four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be approximately 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee of family planning in the commune of caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason that many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Newberry, 27 years and his wife, Liu Ruban, 26 years, said they would love to have two children and they are legally permitted.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we fly the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the act.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, head of human resources, said that she wanted a single child because she was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and had the habit that everyone deals with us."
We are not in the habit of taking care of someone else and we do not really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company says more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which reduce the birth rate, he says, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
People of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle in the early stages of the capitalist and China do not want to have themselves this lifestyle, he says.
Even a single child time-consuming of his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of his life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you need to write her CV for a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want too much.
The United Nations has plans for reducing emissions
The conference on climate, sponsored by the UN -- characterized so far by postings disorganized and mutual recrimination -- is back in the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, the next time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as much as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important breakthrough in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how the rich world would give poor to withstand global warming, and long-term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key questions, including how developed economies and the new emerging economies could reduce their output of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John coequyt àwashington, representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, has studied a negotiating text 180 pages to focus on what has described the executive secretary general on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or for avoided deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the United States negotiating climate has rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The US will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not focus enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern has made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has stated that the US chief negotiator, lacked "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the US would not help financially China to combat global warming.
With future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects occurred both in the third world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States could be acrimony on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific imperatives to act more bravely.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also advising on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 states, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of Small Island States has "put political pressure on the political process complete", in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, so that delegates have focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government to reach an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian environment minister, Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Minister stepped off their plane and rushed in the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information in order to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people entering and leaving the Palais des Congrès each day -- activists guitar players are nocturnal entertainment mocking of the countries they betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of major, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
The trucks arrived.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle appetite at night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first commuter train at high speed in the country will reach 225 km/h, while spinning of Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost suburban cities become successful, durations of business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of environmental hazards may curb high-speed lines British.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make her paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
It will provide a detailed map of the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be comic within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 presented three options for a high-speed network larger, going to the north.
Lord Adonis will be in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration, for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line splits into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from west Pennines àmanchester and Scotland and another toward the northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross the Scotland.
"It appears that this will be the best option of said a professional performance of rail.
When completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel an hour.
The proposals will allow the train travel 400km/h, making the UK the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal to accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be constructed in part by part.
The trains will first have to roll out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure passage of aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of rail.
Taxpayers repay the loan of 75,000 GBP for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, senior Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a Orangerie he built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron to be complained that members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its loan of 75,000 GBP to build an extension of oak at his second home, Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities in the Commons have received complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, which conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more simple".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of emoluments asserts that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing in its plans as an orange.
The neighbours describe as a "veranda for fun".
He was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of standards and privileges of the Commons, provisions concerning its borrowing prerequisites.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of GBP 271.406 ownership of London at home in his constituency that he has bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately 1,400 GBP per month of interest to borrow up to March of last year.
In April, applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr. Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were designed to finance the borrowing of 75,000 GBP.
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to seek GBP 250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist was allegedly filmed stating that members of Parliament had to survive "on budget" after the scandal of spending.
"In fact, it is now, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" E "M ...
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was correct.
And I have asked damn more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, millionaire since his former job as a dealer in oil, has begun to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £ the lawn of M Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked 4,000 GBP for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr. Duncan has dit:"c'était for improvements capitals, approved by both the office costs and then by Legg. "
He added: "There is no problem got away or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, come all see the schedule for the advent of Brighton
The booths of Brighton Beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, a calendar of the Advent interactive.
Beyond, a group of church alternative which encourages the spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., each day, with blocks and wine served hot free.
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I saw three ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and the first Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years, an assistant marketing TV of Hove is unpaid, a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and director of beyond.
He said: "We hope that religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we expect that people entering an old building strange? it seems to me that the church should get closer to people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of the timing of the advent of the cabin Beach came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent it through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger warders, the actions
The unions for prison warders have called Friday to the "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the holiday season bonuses and overtime payment has been pushed back to January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2nd Union Supervisors) asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning before the prisons and the "block", for "denounce the theft of their due."
The cgt-pénitentiaire (3rd Union of the profession) calls "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for strong mobilization," finding "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of 'overtime, bonuses at night, Sundays and holidays "worked in October.
And the first Union supervisors, the Union autonomous federal prison (ufap/unsa), "calls on the general mobilization (...) to raise the discontent and anger".
The direction of the prison administration and the Department of Justice explained that overtime have increased substantially in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to trade unions supervisors guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writes the minister of justice in this letter.
I have asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation was born poor assessment of overtime does not recur in the future, adds Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay of December will therefore be lean, except for personal direction with the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the ufap/unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the Union interregional fo of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings".
The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens fo rhône-alpes-auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the cgt-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less well off than others.
But the account is not found, the secretary general of the UFAP, Jean-François forget.
For Christmas, Obama said offer more owls "tricks" than those receiving
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas in family in the White House, gave the "Papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule: "I give gifts of tricks spotted more than I get."
As part of a special program airing Sunday evening on channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the small companion to four legs of the family.
The Father Christmas also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" a gift, according to excerpts of the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama takes issue with claims of her husband about the quality of the gifts that he receives: "Certainly not, I you have offered gifts Mounties last year," she teased the president.

During the hour, relaxed atmosphere, with the famous moderator who has been a staunch support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama has evoked a bicycle to ten speeds, but also a balloon basket that his Kenyan father that he has rarely seen offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time where I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me the ball.
The first lady is remembered for his part of his Dollhouse.
I didn’t really know how to organize a house so I had aligned all furniture against the wall, rather than arrange around the chimney, but as much as I loved this small house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.

USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for the dismissal of charges
Counsel for the filmmaker franco-polonais Roman Polanski claimed again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western United States), the dismissal of charges against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of morality of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of "The Pianist", has denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977.
I called for the abandonment of expenses here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "chilling".
According to him, the Judge Rittenband -- since died -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with an attorney who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the lips of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells was finally declared late September have "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to dismiss the case, Mr. Hummel has claimed a trial, which would present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not be in court.
The filmmaker, aged 76 years, had fled the US in 1978 before sentencing, for "illegal" sexual intercourse with a minor of 13 years.
He never presented the feet in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor for the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said Roman Polanski "should be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "request a favour to the court, while contemptuous its authority".
One of the three judges -- which now have 90 days to make their decision -- underlined "that there were other alternatives to the leak".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to claim the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client does not being harassed at every twist of the case Polanski, she added: "One in this room say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he has been under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.

In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3 % in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
The confidence of American consumers also rebounded sharply in December, to 73.4 67.4 against the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the index of the University of Michigan.

In technology stocks have lost ground.

The new Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The new Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," assured Friday, his son David upon arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was to go to the bedside of his father hospitalised for several days.
The new is positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday at its off the plane which caused him to Paris shortly after 1:00 p.m. local (21.00 GMT).
The son of singer, relaxed air, ensured that he was going to make "very quickly" to hospital cedars-sinaï de Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection caused by the operation of a herniated disk on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and power to administer its treatment", said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors from the hospital cedars-sinaï de Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection caused by the operation of a herniated disk on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be pathologist Wednesday night to Thursday because of extensive damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles where is educated their daughter Jade, to attend a school performance, found an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves catoné, announced that he would visit Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the clinic Internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday party was "much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I had myself two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything", after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Oxford where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce a haematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor reputation sulphurous, repeatedly condemned by Justice, in records in medical liability, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the Medical Association, accused him of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council, and which is "far from advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David koubbi.
It said that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the reviews post-operative were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and thus did not have the installation of a drain", he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are growing since the summer, appears in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens, Editor's note) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The Association UDF increase in the tone and the new centre to no longer use its acronym
The Association UDF, controlled by the modem François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym for the ex-communist giscardien, by requiring the state no longer use on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after he reached out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of CN.
To support his approach, he received the support of the MP Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-ump spent at NC) claiming ownership of the trade mark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the office of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to dispossess, emerged from his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the MP, requiring no longer use the acronym and transmit their ownership of the mark, on pain of prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you propose to your political movement of +reprendre+ the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist alliance.
You also see fit to follow up on your equipment and activist on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the +nouveau centre+, the slogan +l'udf of aujourd'hui+, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) Internet site".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass the property of (the) marks its legitimate rights holders".
If you do not normally, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in full since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the ump".
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym Union for French Democracy (UDF).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continues the bureau, "when he filed the mark", it was "more adherent of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
It benefits fraudulently grossly and the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform.
This unjustifiable conduct is developing into a crime, they denounce before derisively on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for themselves than trying out of anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right".
Business Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as the accused in the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old to rob a portion of his fortune.
The photographer 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fines.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter will tear while taking the reins of the empire of L'Oréal cosmetics.
But the 15th criminal Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be carried out collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors identified Friday will be required to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying, especially if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think that it is.
I will speak to him, said at the end of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman me.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the tribunal.
This is excellent news (...) the expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this lady aged that we must protect, he said.
Over the past two years, single girl Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist hands-on, which it accuses of having benefited for years the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros of donations in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of Masters.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as an old friend.
While the tribunal should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, pleadings lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said to be wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer added: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again felt that the complainant was not admissible to act, particularly as a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, marie-chrsitine daubigney.
The tribunal has finally decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of the Economic Intelligence will have been in vain …
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees, recalls the position of companies vis à vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it comes to join the collaborators to "values" determined from above as it was in the past, to impose products to consumers thought by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has provided marketing strategies of conquest of markets where ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of clienteles regularly return!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly morale.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, ie "requires all stakeholders (…) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the revenues of authoritarian management frustrates completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the business in the same way as the client.
The usefulness of opinion polls on internal
Opinion polls — as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - will they encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
However, I fear not.
- first because I saw that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many twists, priority … what it has always done.!
- secondly, authoritarianism – a pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behavioural neuroscience "recently reactivated by the" American and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by institutions and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in the figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of governance, mechanistic unsuited to today’s world.
Identify and measure the factors of involvement
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, implies a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental point: for employees, the commitment to the business is possible only if it is clear as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they deem their company based on a predetermined orthodoxies that allows them through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their social "performance" and surrender their management of human resources "to the place".
They create fertile ground for joint development of a robust economic intelligence and effective.
Oslo speech: the "just war" is the right to praise Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had pointed the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, — of the right wing of the Republican Party, USA Today, adding itself have addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in his memoirs that have been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
It should stop these terrorists while there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, found that the president had done at Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential about.
By some side, I found this speech quite history, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed at the broadcast "The takeaway".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen "a president left" to remind members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist at The Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave a speech "very American".
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "always", "he spoke as an American President", recalling the Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security they have not created and they do little to preserve", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few to right to not be satisfied, a hawk of the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, has called the speech "dull, bloated and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the envelope war notion of justice, one can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The Press centre-left remained commendation to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, called his remarks "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", has ignited the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama "delivered the speech that", said the New York Times, the ruling "both dark and building".
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of marathon road sector, trade unions and employers’ organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, reached an agreement Friday night to end the strikes and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the sitting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left early morning Friday, with the hope of signing rapidly in the late morning the text of the agreement.
Although three employers' organisations (FNTR, unostra, Ur) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11.00 so that everyone is in agreement and 6pm the text is signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "there were fears that disturb the Christmas years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for wage increases of 4 % for the lowest wages (in road transport, local and regional), and 2.9 % for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for low-wage, "from 8.72 euro 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice closed (FO).
What is it going to give the order to our activists that there is no blockages, no blockade of supplies.
But we can always have a few holdouts who are not happy, he said.
Philippe grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages in light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has referred to "an acceptable compromise.
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3 %, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that `a decrease of EUR 100 million of foreign nationals "was the subject of a government amendment to the Finance Bill corrigendum for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement applies initially to companies adhering to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers’ organisations may only delay the process.
FNTR denounced a "market of fools", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax".
The secretary d?etat transport has obliged to negotiate in extractor, not in conclusion SNP shared analysis, but not to antagonise the eaters Turkey next eve, deplored the unostra.
For the Ur, the agreement risk "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER, the largest line of urban transit of France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday at the 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger for their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be no trains between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., a train on two central (on the stretch between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will require passengers to change the process.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP to serve the department stores".
The RER crossing from West to East the greater Paris.
The segment short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and RATP Nanterre to boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak times, and virtually no rowed in, as planned.
As Thursday, there were no crowds on the docks, Île de France is being held.
And in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual because of the absence of school students.
A boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "half an hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time".
The Gare Saint-Lazare has not been saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had planned a framework of agents and the forces of law and order.
The RER has operated by the SNCF from or to cergy-le-haut arriving or leaving the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, deemed "weak" by unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER has on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what the drivers who want a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even its proposals for premium in parentheses, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not kaput to resolve a problem while among road and the SNCF is done".
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", said the RATP.
So also to unions that the company "scoffed at the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the directorate, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after filing a notice by UNSA and independent.
The unions want a premium of EUR 120 (UNSA) to EUR 150 of which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain about the deterioration in working conditions on this line in daily million travellers.
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career, affect 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums for staggered schedules, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision implications
The Turkish Constitutional Court has ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the court president Hasim Kilic, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr Kilic, adding that 37 of the frameworks of the party, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Armenia Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms. Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament rather than to sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy rebels of the PKK.
The party maintains, however, that he did "not organic links" with the PKK but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the court comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to dry up support for Kurdish PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had asserted that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
With the announcement of Justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city in southeast populated majority of Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated also in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, Editor's note) by prohibiting a party, he said to the Press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic trend, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the party.
This resolves nothing, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of torpedoing the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, to a reaction of the PKK, he said.
Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-Valley.
For a long time she had the reputation of secret city, closed to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of armaments research secret, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" Soviet Union.
Centres of production and research into micro - and nanoelectronics are implanted.
As early as September 2008 representatives of zelenograd have established links with riedberg, place des Sciences Mehr – with academic institutions and companies of the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There have been meetings and reciprocal last Wednesday and representatives of zelenograd riedberg signed a "memorandum of close collaboration".
The signatories were the vice-mayor of Moscow Juri rosljak and the prefect of Anatoly smimov zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will leave to zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific discussion
It is an exchange scientific development.
But also economic relations.
It will allow companies FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
By contrast the Russian scientists companies seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of research institutes and companies Soviet famous.
They include the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, large firms Sitronics and rosssijskaja-elektronika.
The policy was founded in 1958 as "city" socialist planned for research in armaments.
Zelenograd (literal translation "green city) derives its name from forested hills with research centres are located.
The project S21: a disincentive for Stuttgart
Cannot be placed high enough in the Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If. S21, it is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, chaos despairing of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head of online, with tracks that ended in full city, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the technique of transport of the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because there was once a lot of time to get the locomotives of the back to the front.
Arrival, judgment short, departure – that is why we must do.
That is why the head of line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of passage of trains, halfway around the masterly on trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer long compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head of line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with cars voiture-pilote at both ends.
However it is launching the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new line inter-city to Ulm.
The regional and communal prevailed.
The company is in part because it is the taxpayer who made the cost of the risks of the government of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the point of view planning the project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban space that – if we are to believe the charts planners generated by computer – will be very verdant.
For the system of rail transport the S21.
The station of passage and the enlargement of the section are designed for human trafficking which attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affect many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian.
It is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade will this money for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Department of Transportation reported in any 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 a braking hoof.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the decision regarding the airport
The regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the administrative tribunal of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The minister of economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had commissioned experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the proposed construction of the runway aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport was realized.
The authorization of attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5H of morning, as envisaged in the land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition should have decided for January 4 if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticism that period and attempts to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the federal administrative court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be; as a total failure to a word.
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir by alluding to the FDP electoral slogan "We are delivering on our promises".
The minister Dieter Posch refute the accusations of schäfer-gümbel who claims that the land government tries to authorize still night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not make a decision on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
The US banks to repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the rescue plan TARP.
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions seeking to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of amounts, such as limiting bonus allocated to leader as well as the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of shares to investors who reported $19 billion of new money.
The remainder comes from boxes of the Bank that are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the director general of the Bank of America held specifically to thank us taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also looking to raise money on financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The US bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, related chain CNBC citing the banking community.
The voice of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they received.
Early elections
Finally it was still spent faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding the post of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF TV, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who heads the drafting of ZDF Berlin was the overwhelming favourite.
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further weaken intendant of ZDF Markus schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the board of directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known to the closing of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, schächter had proposed to the board of directors to extend the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this was rejected.
Only seven council members had supported the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by vote of Brender represented a spectacular failure while predictable schächter.
Indeed, the CDU majority on the board of directors had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to reappoint Brender to his position.
It is Roland Koch, the minister-president of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed writer in chief is extended, citing the fact that the rate of viewing from the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why the protests were still in place, almost up to the vote, lashing out at growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had inadvertently in the debate and who believed that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But it has been for nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the science-policy, pedagogy fit romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in radio südwestfunk (body of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in news magazine "heute-journal" (Journal of today).
Then her journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992 until then, and in 1998 he was chief and presenter of "morgenmagazins" (issuance of fortnightly information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the then head of the Berlin drafting ZDF.
After the disgrace of Brender, while it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The adversary of Koch to the board of directors, the minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the intergovernmental treaty of ZDF proposals so that the staff of the intendant could not be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck does not intend to request the removal of politicians, members of the committees to monitor the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender had cleverly manoeuvred to the board in criticizing the Commission vehemently in its decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the board of directors could elect without being suspects to place as a partisan politics.
In the representations arithmetic of parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Clean in university education
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between ministers and delegates from the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students bachelor or master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are in particular set of accordpour lessen the weight of reviews: a single examination is to close the module to study selected.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée proportions to ensure "realistic and acceptable".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder commitment to organise common structural requirements more flexible types of bachelor and master.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulatory a land to another.
Less of
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the minister of education of the Länder and the university rectors have tirelessly to mouth the words: "étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning.
The accreditation council decided to reduce significantly the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination", a document 30 pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, president of Accreditation Council declares that significantly reducing the burden of reviews should stop skidding, which hampered considerably étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should be, in the future, the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies.
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this sensation choking it feels like sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / BERLIN - according to the latest knowledge in Kunduz, raid on the opposition believes that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted.
These cycles should be "accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 agencies accreditation authorities on the entire federal territory that depend on Accreditation Board created by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies to ensure that programmes are not too loaded and the regime of exams not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialty have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only land to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance as well as the offices of reviews and the service of international relations
The Länder and the universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
As a result it will spend more than a single examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will have to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other institutions of higher education and access to the master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, l"étudiabilité "of all graduate will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of the conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticism is heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist students indicated that he would like the organization of education policy hardly in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike educational, students as people concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education it received the support of the President of the delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the education ministers of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of reform.
For the Union of education and science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough, calling the right and opportunity for each bachelor graduate to enrol in a cycle of master.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the gew requests that the Länder provide students bachelor of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
However, the education ministers have not raised the possibility of easing access to the master.
Just a footnote on Herta Müller,
It is by these words' arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ... "that begins a work of poet Werner söllner, in which he dealt in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its territory language.

Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Helmuth frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the political police Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
The trials of enrolment insidiously began in 1971.
I am, therefore concludes söllner "someone who has not sufficiently stood chances of intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner söllner is the informant Walter (MI Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel prize for Herta Müller and its literary conflict copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case which clearly shows the pitfalls and baseness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner söllner is, as far as we can say based on current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securitate, Im Walter played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"He had been able to draw all the difficult situations at the time", according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its collaboration with the Secret Service Romanians is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve pleasant for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of its own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last names borrowing Sorin, voicu and Walter.
Instead of Germany where meanwhile consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been continually thwarted and hindered in the past.
It was only in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files has rather dragged since.
It has existed since 2005 a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, J said very dismissive about the winner.
It had a psychosis, and ultimately had questioned only once.
The infamy of power felt able to speak here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, a lot of inevitable questions associated with case söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? which has been despoiled? the reaction weighted listeners, the admission of söllner, suggest that this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Turmoil in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative arrived there, drawn in their finest from any right to a Christmas party Nice, on which the manufacturer of sports had spread its goods when the new coach VfB Christian Gross Monta at midnight quarter in a Mercedes C Class, that he had just called, an orange plastic bag supplier's hand.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, let him drive in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our reenergize could have taken the wheel – he had not been drinking alcohol and nor was he drunk happiness.
He spent a pleasant but tomorrow evening had to return to work.
As it is now that it had begun.
The words of Switzerland was to hire three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eighth of", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal battle for not falling back".
The "significant" we expected on Sunday.
There, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League in everyday life.
And to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of expeditious Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Ballot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 february/ return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn the 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only among those who had brought luck, who had sent to professionals in Stuttgart destabilized motivation, a seamless and pleasure to play.
I see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I told them to be more courageous, "explained the plumber of souls" – gross - a recipe for success that sounded if bienmais did more with the trainer Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel -, "in the foot when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break to injury, asked to rank the best player through its dynamism, attempted to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and working methods of the new leader is "someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Apparently Babbel had failed in.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed Cape, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs determination.
As Gross, the players and the manager keep overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow until four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0:4 Khedira, objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signalled that they had reached one of the goals of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We have not gone through difficult.
Heldt that on the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann fit bounce just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, confounded Heldt, in response to the sharp criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change their coach under pressure from fans counseling.
Lehmann was also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after matches has been deleted.
Statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" broke Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two 40-50.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and combative sports would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "for a large share in the success" class countered Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag agreed.
World Championships trucks
Combat warm in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger causing constantly verbally and gestural the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles according to the version of the Russian WBC.
The unanimity of the judges it imposed on points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The Russian WBC announced that on the night of Saturday, the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time with honour Klitschko defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had already won two times the title of world champion of federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not passed the KB.
Klitschko, came out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, say twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat at the 24th combat.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko has especially wanted to dictate the fight, at the top of its 2.02 metres, by its against left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid hitting the champion, crushing and Klitschko to come into play its against right-wing big-hitters.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures have attained its beating very rarely the champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the battle.
It insulta Klitschko the villain on "zombie" who "is not really capable."
During the Friday, weighing the champion was unable to avoid provoking Johnson by breaking down his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth win since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko has imposed again at its fourth combat since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he was beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "their" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a struggle.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of USA.
"I just took a blow in this struggle and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring.
Her dream is to try to gather in the family the four titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion Federation.
But it is Britain's David Haye who, having détroné the General Nikolai walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company intends to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case of Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg lie in the case of the case Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left party (Die Linke) asked the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/berlin - after reviewing the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister has intentionnellement"formulé a legalisation "deadly strikes on two trucks last September, said the head of the parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information chain ard" Tagesschau "(The Journal of 8pm).
This means that he lied.
The order to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe consisted of reality, not to destroy the stolen truck, but was intended to eliminate two Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack, which was launched at the request of the German colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have prayed Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to rule as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted massacre is part of the government's Afghan political profile if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The spokesman of the government rejects the criticism.
The chancellery has in any way influenced the interventions of the Army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were becoming stronger doutesquant to express the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as this had been presented by the department.
According to the information in the journal Spiegel, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack on the trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of NATO and the minister some details hidden troublesome.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggest that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein as well as a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would meanwhile requested in a letter clarifying the facts.
So far, it has not received a response
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal Parliament was going to be the next Wednesday to bring the facts in question.
The worlds of vision
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only among mental patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our houses clouded, we can engage unhindered dreams and fantasies most crazy.
However, awake, experienced dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination is at issue: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes that encourages the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to melt.
A wakefulness aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs of the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda, member seconds of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmitter in the brain - first and foremost the noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Hallucinations complex and delusional thoughts occur very often for a psychosis schizophrenic.
The force of attraction land no longer has power over the individual.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and the dream" for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions it.".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning t turns into a comic strip character.
The body is in two dimensions to the garish colours.
The attraction land no longer has power over him, Raz flat in the ceiling.
He feels at once.
Behind him Devil winged creatures, spooky, the mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give it beating feet with heavy boots redstart, the cast against the walls, it feels pain throughout the body.
Vote roaring, nasty, howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer support those voices that the insult and humiliated.
Henning T. hard two cables of its stereo system, in fact a loop and attached to a hook ceiling.
It stands on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
It drives.
The cycle stands out.
So you learn a lesson, screaming voices in a choir to wrest the tympanum. "goes in a clinic and present yourself care!"
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was initiated by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective paranoid psychosis, moreover, it is manic, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I had terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel.
About one percent of the population has at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, those concerned can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which they can suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is quite common to hear voices – voices command, which comments or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are common.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious drowned under the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centred on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of Chu of Heidelberg (Allgemeine psychiatry Im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the heart of the situation, while a service focused on him.
At the same time he found himself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and may not act on them.
This is why the schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and delusional hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived in a real framework.
Why our brains make such antics, is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional circumstances can get everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
Researchers suggest that the persons concerned are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the maturation of neurons in the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained, it is the way the anomaly of neural system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, but if there are predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they affect the neurotransmitters.
When our brain heated.
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten Lübeck is that their psychotic suffer from hallucinations and take expensive drugs successes while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain.
The collection pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and extreme images illusory: last year he published its findings in a book entitled "the unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are part of concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
They include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or head injury.
It is surprising that in certain circumstances even the brains of healthy individuals is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brains heating but also when there is lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, one third of participants admitted to at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and it goes to high school.
A young girl to normal in reality.
If not for the images and voices.
During the recess, a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, send him the floor.
When she replied his comrades watch, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this young girl shy is a dreamer lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It may even be its presence momentarily.
It is a good feeling, she found this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, is it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are burdensome.
When she is in the classroom, sometimes it can follow the course because the professor is just being present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly explaining the equations in table.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, it expects the sleep that came too little and too late, it often cannot distinguish if she is awake or dream already, if the images that it sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody gashes on the arms and legs are faced with his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, Cree to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents nor his friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. now 20 years ago.
She had her BAC last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since it came in contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, ensures that there is of animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called Dad, since it was in age to believe, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for acoustic and visual hallucinations, and impressions and actual noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality. "each experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are images that are formed in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
Night for Kasten, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one line between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on realizing it was unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael schmidt-degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of Clinical Psychiatry and Psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the modification of the conscience awakened by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves who are perceived by the real lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is awake.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience paralysis engine.
According to schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total incapacity and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by its own fantasy which is divorced from reality.
This is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intensive methods and interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, an organization that is given to us men, not to sink into none of the loss of consciousness.
This is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian oniroïdes also describes his experiences in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
He was 49 years, when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he created from scratch, visit places, foreign travel in time. He was in bed old man in a sanitarium rail, a robot at the bedside experiences.
He lives in the Middle Ages of the noble who manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is removed by a Greek Moto who takes in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the firn Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this fantasy, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different, he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from travel disorders are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
One can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this lived is breaking the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes delusions, hallucinations and psychosis, psychedelic experiments show us how our domestic performances of the external reality are fragile even.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow can become
Burda
27 years ago, children will be the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children return to press group, he said to the Journal Spiegel.
The holding company should be 100 % a family business.
Hamburg - in the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children inherit to 27 years and are firmly resolved to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the business will thereafter.
It will also see if they are able.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
It will demolish the children as well as the business.
Burda said last Thursday that it was withdrawing from the position president in January and that his successor was paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the board of directors since 1999.
It was responsible for in the technology sector.
Subsequently he held the Treasury sector, that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer he took the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time this is not a family member who is the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda 19 and 17 years respectively, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 to 15 years "
Burda said that the holding must remain 100 % in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always held in families who are left to cause by a bulimia Capital, who have made tremendous speculation unfortunate thinking they could climb ever higher.
That has never been my.
I have never been a rêvede universal power Burda said.
I am absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues as the time, these firms have taken far too much importance.
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility of even see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine called him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: One designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life, to six times more expensive than the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited that his brother American, but includes a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscriptions, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a PDA already know what represents the abandonment of the data when it crosses a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of FON) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and for a long time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a PhD in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose roaming rates affordable throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside their country of origin, there is a reluctance to use the data, and it is not wrong.
A small aircraft as fonpeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it lacks the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals allowing them to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other Internet searches.
With no subscription and boat.
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as peek already proposed in the United States.
Not that I want to purchase.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the function of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a mantle of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a model very similar on both occasions: in addition to their colour similarities, a yellow to green with bright reflections, both times, the holding was composed of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the mantle, in the same tissues, and painted with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States follows the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to deliver the same held.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets makes them very different.
If the office it was a thick lace, in contrast, she was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
Accessories also are different: green footwear to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but Doré, this time.
Hairdressing also has changed: the hair are now identified as she was dropped last time.
75 % of mothers who work have had problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This study "fertility and professional career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75 percent of working mothers saw their professional career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the job.
Those who do not have work outside the home, working part-time or have a relatively stable, are earlier in a couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, primarily in the public sector, pushing the entry in life couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years having a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for it, which led to repel the Union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence largely maternity, but less than the start date of common life, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, that the basic and higher have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinctness is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have conducted studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done studies of average level or higher reverse this program and give priority to achieving a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Mrs Delgado.

The poker manual Vincent SA
Manuel Vincent offers us in poquer of worker (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) about 30 "X-rays" of writers who crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the genera predictable and apprehended (abstract biographical, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the nucleus of ignition of character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent makes nor the spawning nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation to readings and rereadings moving.
I leave you with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "in its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but an impulse almost spiritual, physical, the one I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence no God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless as the blade of the knife which almost kill it."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman a passion that lasted 13 years, in the flesh, which he emotion of adultery in the pleasure of remorse, a privilege spiritual which was to reach the heavens by the Road to Perdition."
On James Joyce’s Ulysses, "was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand metres from the universal literature, he must climb by the north face, on which the best climbers quit still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
Of itself, he said, sometimes it was the heir of a landowner County and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
The two dreams were of magnitude. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up CRI denies pushed from a bridge by this man of Munch to bring its echo until the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and it did in the leak of himself and by invoking the posterity with a speech to violent maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she went to his knees and prayed to God:" Beloved, I urge you to do that I constantly write as a woman ".
On Joseph Conrad: "on his tomb were engraved worms of Spenser:" Sleep after effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the guerre,/ after life, tired death delights. "
On Virginia Wolf: "in its baggage she was carrying his depression.
Her husband accepted very normally say to him that Edward VII the scrutinized between azaleas or that birds singing in Greek.
It has never seen a man also patient and lover of a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded the madness. "
On Pío baroja: "That was martín-santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce among baroja?
As tried, Benet if it is to shoot baroja by Faulkner?
Did this if it is to suck the glory of this man for use as a primary pedestal? "
A coward aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhoods of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 passed it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the spa and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two shots feet who knew better the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what’s fun in attacking a free small animal without defence which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and who, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, a man or, ultimately, anyone lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another, in a district usually quiet.
The dog has gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the office of the District although we doubt that this serves to much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spaniards.
The outrage led us to denounce this.
We do not understand what is happening in young to find fun of abusing free an animal without defence which gives us of affection, friendship and US company.
We do not know where is good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and fesvial, set for the helmet
The manufacturer Michelin tires, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists younger, as today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, as this is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said that she contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
The new campaign encouraging helmet use in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be" will have a first phase, during which posters will be distributed in over 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the Union employers ganvam, ANFAC manufacturers and dealers.
However, it should qualify the good news, since the reference used for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60 % compared with the previous year.
Consequently, despite the surge in the last month, registrations accumulated during those 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all the vehicles which fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and light trucks lightweight chassis) 95,853 were sold.
The big clouds that affect their application have not provided dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, who pay in almost 100 % of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000th have little basis.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed the 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in ganvam, reminded again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of dealers provides a year 2010 similar to that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
As has taken place with the anti-lock brake system (ABS and as will take place with the ESP stability control systems, emergency brake assistance will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to support on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1,100
The intervention of the aid, Revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance whose car to need to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking: it is calculated that a disaster on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, and be slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device has the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors regrowth until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8 – after Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, meant that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be provided to workers and the governments of countries where the factories are located, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, among GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM agreed to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group converg becomes more important.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder driving
To design their last and precious jewel, engineers are parties of the Porsche Boxster S and succeeded in the thinning of nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilograms.
This has led to happen in the first place, the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof container manual, to reduce 21 kilos, to employ doors in aluminum GT3, such as those of the other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the reservoir of essence of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, to Mount bacquets sport, still 12 kilos, and with lightweight tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system cdr-30, thus gaining six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes door handles in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box PDK dual clutch, the test was conducted on a model to manual box of six speeds, mainly on roads of secondary Network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
Behaviour cannot be described as beyond reproach.
The reduced weight does not prevent the car to drive on the floor with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees of security in turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of heating its musclesà small speed during the time required, until we ask him to sprinter, stop, recover and grow back its engine …
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, communicative also specifies that the car will do what will indicate our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His willingness to
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether the judgment or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road that we have travelled with the boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car has managed the potholes.
The electronic assistants took barely act of presence on the whole journey, while some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be put to the sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.

The baskonia is a victory in Israel.
The Caja Laboral obtained a resounding triumph at 91-82 during his visit on the ground hard of Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences that plagued the team of Dusko Ivanovic. is head of his group, after the great spectacle of Mirza teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or micov by a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points marked, hastened the ultimate victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the outset.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, foreshadowed that they had jumped on the ground of Israel with the wrists hot.
English and teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the game inside of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to standing out as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although the "least six" assessment splitter left already indicate that the night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on track to break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wished to remind that of Vitoria that does not win so easily on their ground, and thanks to "the hand of Elias," they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and pnini helped decisively to take the advantage on the yellow light (50-49).
Other issues
The players Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed some clever sequencing actions to take the air, and that is when the submachine arises of Mirza teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas handed meter to score a reassuring (54-67), and that the premises succeeded to accentuate the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala came out to play everything at the last period and English and San Emeterio 60-75 (345) that they would take their tire person what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not rally and tried to support since the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players Ivanovic did not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and victory was slipping out of Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevented the Unicaja fight
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece face Olympiacos and transferred the head of group B of the euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players of Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship or by the scale of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game in the first quarter, helped to dream the Andalusia. an aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the Arsenal of the local team with the game, and inside Bourousis Vujcic Schortsanitis, has toppled the score ten, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, an early fight, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team started showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of pivot English Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas kleizas, with their baskets to three points, dug the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
A recovery not
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos who, despite 19 losses, showed superior and even came to match the difference of the encounter contested in Malaga 66-48, the twenty-seventh minute falter, the head of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit from Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, baskets to three points of Cook, and support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos showed when players were relentless pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The pivot Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to trace the score to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and the Unicaja be argued, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil set a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president reversed should abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he is a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must go on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention that leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, naturally with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya has ensured that it would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation has ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the status of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised and, without questioning their political maverick liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year of next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain an economic recovery measures without heterodox and we are seeing an inversely to the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and variances business obligations are growing again, although they remain very distant occultism levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were shelters selected by investors, provocative increased differences between the euro zone countries and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & poor'sa threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who tried to provoke a new case of conscience in understanding of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of limiting the credit derivatives on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to impose a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen in the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot with roses.
Prodi was in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a non respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a member country of the euro area not to respect its commitments.
Which makes sense is that Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens co-responsible of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums transient, after some excesses in senior positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences of public debt is increasing the obligations of European companies, in not to worry about.
If the European gap decreased and that ours continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our predictors require most services studies to anticipate their models of revival and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the load with a Japanese model pourl’économie Spanish, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all the air to form an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, although for the moment "caution is mother safety."
Business connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the President of gas natural-fenosa, Rafael villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press what he had told the subcommittee, in camera.
For the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, where nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments did not rise to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses both on gas-fired than coal, with recovery mechanisms of carbon dioxide, and surtout,sur renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW of more are needed, with other energies "support".
Galán, who believes that the bill for sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with the demands of his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "one-off" as described the chairman of Iberdrola.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are located on the long terme,doivent start to be taken, because they put some time before reaching maturity and a remunerative stable framework is needed to address them.

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to pending and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a dealer of public works and highways.
The mayor of the city wants to receive by the end of 2014.
Having chosen the public private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a case under the tutelage SRS & Young, local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May next year, the expected investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase will face three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and ghella.
The first is one of the largest builders Australians, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of underground work.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium northern direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure Transfield and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium which has passed the test is lbrjv whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of German builder Hochtief, which has in turn of the involvement of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but enter represents a great difficulty, if not by way of acquiring a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the businesses and linde-kca-dresden Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS is just to conquer this market by its participation of 30 % in linde-kca-dresden, owner of Leighton.
Working millionaire
Acciona placing on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity in the sector of energy supplier and desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the grouping of companies to build and manage the dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
She now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for the construction and management of infrastructure.
The underground road toll, promoted by the office of infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and liaison said Northern Link (North), is called upon to connect the motorway toowong western peripheral route to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km tunnel as part of an existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this road toll will be open to traffic late 2014, it is not anticipated that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel has begun to be designed in 2005.
It will include two times two lanes, a system of electronic toll and a ventilation system complex.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers of pending
Australia continues to be largely build linde-kca-dresden mentioned yesterday, which has a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband fibre optic.
This will allow 400,000 people to have a fast Internet access and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the proposed construction of the tower King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and linde-kca-dresden concluded the sale to 129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.

A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of 63 million euros to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers in the margins of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and even state company, accumulates over 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors.

Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million at Real Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, the Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467,4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth position of clubs who have profited to the tune of the more money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs.
Indeed, competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to Uefa.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served in this distribution.
The club White was the third of the continent to receive more money for his participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, the current title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, although they have lost before the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third countries in terms of the money earned by the Champions League, although she won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for allocating money applied by Uefa.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, Uefa will devote 413.1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the games classification (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match disputed.
There is also a bonus if they win (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in final perceive seven-eighths of three million each, the eight teams arriving in the final quarter of reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will earn $9 million, with 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has profited to the tune of $2.5 million for winning the Super European Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the payments variables, which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed in terms of the value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats accredited.
The champion the previous year’s pockets 40 % of the money allocated, 30 % for the second, 20 % for the third and 10 % for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.

It is a newly created position that will depend directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million SOS to companies of Salazar.
Indeed, the possibility that in the next few months SOS reveals new embezzlement cannot be ruled out.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, automobile garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Each claim is different, and the cost of parts and time of workforce can be a long and complex.
To calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100 % of experts use such systems.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers, treat and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, North American Solera group, is the company leader; 80 % of estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in the area of competition and the development of information on the sector are gtmotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.

In addition, the amount of data to be processed, so that over the past five years, more than versions, and clean-engine variants have been launched in the last fifteen years.
When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very difficult, because it takes catalogue each thousand pieces of the vehicle and its price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger vehicle.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work may be ready in a week if the process is very quickly.
If it is a little car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides complete information about 99.2 % of the cars sold in Spain.

The national headquarters is based in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (in general mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex provides $90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and propose various products.
The most frequent concerns the repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of pieces of scrap or to calculate the residual value or a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of second-hand cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support to professionals in the sector.

This tool is bought in terms of its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, up to 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as audavin, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the chain of montage, only through its chassis number.
Audaglass focuses on glasses of vehicles, and a server audasubastas is open to the professional sector on the Internet to bid on vehicles reported wrecks.

The operation touched a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85 % of the company's capital, which could widen next year to 15 %.
The purpose of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its clients, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.

Under Spanish law, a car number chassis was withdrawn can no longer travel, but on the other hand, some parts which are not affected can be used as spare parts.
The cars of collection can be re-registered, although they were withdrawn after complex.
Description of garage in four steps
With the tool, the company auda-taller Audatex ensures that the user gets a quotation in only four steps: identify the vehicle, seek the spare, create a quotation and generate.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are restive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109, 137 off-road motorcycles, 44 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection is required.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of the model in question appears then selects the room needed.
The user can include variables such as the price of the workforce, increases or reductions, then it can print the estimate for the return to the customer.
Audataller is not a tool to estimate as audaplus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is as garages does not include the time Labour estimated.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very receptive, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turning to see the inside.
