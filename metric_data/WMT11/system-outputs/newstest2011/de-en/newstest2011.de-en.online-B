What to do, the CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "pastry."
The new councilors of the capital from the ranks of the CSSD will have to overcome some obvious language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and in the representation at all.
The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD even a little "knocked off" as they master the notorious slang that has become standard in recent years that the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary that was introduced in the bygone era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite, some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae borrowed.
Surprisingly it was found that the new councils fall in relation to these new terms somewhat in the dark.
They say at least.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague's politics," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilor for culture, to test the "godfather of vocabulary."
But the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar manner.
For example, the term "golf hole."
"This is the only expression of those that you present to me here, I occasionally use."
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang."
From the vocabulary that had published the daily paper Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Council.
The Social Democrats should "go to the pastry shop, the terms" Voldemort ,"" Prague's largest golf hole, ,"" buffalo hump ,"" paneling "" betrayal of the capital "and define.
Three Prague councilmen agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - but promised his first participation in the conversation, but not even then took up the receiver.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in advance.
"These things I do not care and how the Civic Democrats together to talk, I do not judge it."
"For me it is important how we see ourselves as part of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above headline would have allegedly failed to recognize that the speech by the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" Kaucký says absolutely nothing and the only term he guessed correctly when tested, was "the country's largest golf hole."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, added security, but added: "But I know more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then deciphered not only from Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councilor for environmental issues as Tunnel Blanka Lukáš Plachý correctly.
Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý suspects even where this figure is related to and therefore also what it means to "go into the pastry.
"I think it's like to go in any Prague restaurant business," Plachý is pretty close to the riddle, if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek companies.
Consistent with Březina he asserts, however, to have derived this knowledge from the newspaper rather than to him this vocabulary would own.
Judging from the test participants after, it appears under the Socialists actually do give similar naturalized slang.
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we really do not."
"We call us by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the CSSD Prague Petr Hulinsky - from his party comrades shot "Hulda" called.
"In school I Bříza (birch) was called, but I do not know if my colleagues call me that," tells us Karel Březina his nickname.
The newspaper has tried Deník Aktuálně.cz the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councilman Weinert is for the party comrades kind of "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention before the elections by machinations of the party sponsorship to the will of some colleagues, "Igráček" (famous Czech Lego figure) called.
Nicknames are the only allow the Social Democrats in the intra-party usage.
Hulinsky like it allegedly did not when he is "Hulda" calls, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another nickname of Prague's chairman.
His nickname is "Doctor of truncheon-rights" has nothing to brag that Petr Hulinsky received his Juris Doctor from the title Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women in Burkina Faso branded as witches, have usually some common social characteristics.
They belong to more of the older generation, they find work - for example, for health reasons, they are unmarried and have no children.
If any of these women to Witch "will," it is strictly isolated, the rest of the village so that they can not be dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Even young, healthy women remains in that danger, as they help with the work and bear children," says a religious sister of the situation which looks after the capital of the West African country of Burkina Faso in a special home to more than one hundred women from their Communities have been expelled.
The local government decided now to take action against this abnormal "social action."
And for that reason gave out a brochure that will stop the "witch hunt."
The matter has, however, a catch.
"Can not read more than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso," dismissed the newspaper derStandard "points to the dilemma of the written explanation.
Accused of witchcraft to be but also in other African countries are commonplace.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, was the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men tortured to death - they doused with kerosene and burned them a call.
An incident reported inter alia BBC and the server.
The alleged perpetrators, however, the matter would be only a set of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version of fuel oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
And indeed, after the group tried to "an evil spirit" from the woman "drive out."
The isolation of "witches" support the people here regardless of their education.
Der Standard quoted this a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso, "are gluttons human souls earlier today as a threat," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least striving to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambian president has in the past year mitgemischt the president himself properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked by the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch hunt, as they were allegedly part in their death, and would now try to even the President himself to kill by black magic."
"This he called a shaman from the nearby Guinea to the aid of the force, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the Presidential Guard indiscriminately arrested women and men from Gambian villages, kidnapped and brought to the farm of the President in Kanilai" led the organization Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused the bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested man did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: it heats up while in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older set man just leaving the client's center of society RPG Byty the "coal barons" Zdenek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a portfolio with three new leases to three flats: for their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who had just served a prison sentence.
All three were under the so-called "deregulation" just increased the rent.
Instead of 3,500 crowns monthly rent is the son next year shell out for a 2-room apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is not even in the home heating and running hot water you have in a simple coal furnace," he taps his finger angrily to the new lease of the Son, whose signature he has a mandate.
"But what - I've signed," he says of tune half and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz that the new rental conditions, known as "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants to sign new contracts and not easy to 7 to wait for December, at which it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man waved off only.
"One says this, the other," he scowled.
The Ostrava region becomes a major "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year, before this deregulation in most apartments in the Czech Republic to pay the tenant so far no market rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG-Havířov in the waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and for nine clock breaking this Tuesday morning in full.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency, and with her a call device.
"Rent 2011," a specific digital keypad lights up the screen.
Short tap and have the device spits out a number list.
As soon as we have deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it's your turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush is in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair claims, insurance matters and the like.
flutter from mid-November in the Ostrava region of the envelope with the new leases for most tenants of the 44,000 flats of the portfolio in the RPG the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty shall propose in writing before a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counters for the new hires in the client center since the 18th November.
"The campaign is running a little over a week, that is, that's just the beginning" answer, the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, when the "client" turned out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalas former miners homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, a native of Ostrava Parliament Vice-President of the ČSSD Lubomír Zaorálek this issue had taken up quite loud, no wonder that today, the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want from them a new floor."
"Not even ne dam. Replace the toilet seat, they could" to make the above-mentioned man air.
Until now, available to employees, according to the switch, especially retirees, to ascertain whether they actually receive the promised tenants moderation, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
Benefit from a reduced to half in February to rent the other tenants come to the new lease until 15 December under review.
So far, deregulation switch "in Havířov anything but over-burdened than demands.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 in 2011 because the rent here," officials estimate the switch.
RPG offers placed both on its website, as well as wall panels individual leases, where it is deemed necessary.
Should the tenants not agree on the new rent, she will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but as information about the only legitimate and fully legal approach to understand," says RPG on its website.
"Here, nobody goes to court," said one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street outside the center gives her clients at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, which stay me 5,000 for food left when I should get the money for a court battle," he says.
Then the employee is still uncertain.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, sign it and so should not wait for people aged yet," they are considered.
The regulated rent will end in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and RPG Byty According to the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"Extends the existing rent levels not even the upkeep of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the applied by the tenants criticized the neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowner the main reason for the rent increase.
RPG during the years 2005-2010 could invest the revenue from the rental of four billion at the homes, in the four years 2011-2014 there will be 5.2 billion.
On the large-screen LCD display on the ceiling over the padded chairs in the waiting room of Havířov appear every now and again a couple of red light information.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 flats, which is more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"More means more than 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is on the LCD monitor to read.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, the rent increased by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the extremely low rents increase by 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
The rent remains at 2,600 homes next year on the same level.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation is not the rents sharply driving up, but instead takes place gradually within four to eight years.
What's more - the company imposed a further requirement: All proceeds from the rent increase (see chart), the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But - above all, these people will benefit those who sign the agreements on the rent.
The architects saw one - to the office also has a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect even a small children's garden, with all the trimmings: colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys and even a kids play area on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten is available since last year, the staff of Arch.Design available.
The engineering and architectural firm Arch.Design originate from its studios a number of prestigious buildings in Brno counted from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for their headquarters Mini kindergarten.
In foresight, because most of its 90 employee (s) are in the baby boomer retirement and the company is keen that the project, techs, and architects to return as quickly as possible to their jobs.
Together with the possibility of reduced work, the children's garden, a further bonus, the Arch.Design its employees in the approach of its social programs has to offer.
The civil engineers and architects have it so easy to get to their demanding work and child welfare under one umbrella.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of ​​the employee (s) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to win for their project.
The operating minimum kindergarten is funded by the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment Policy of the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (grants amounting to 2, 8 million CZK) have the necessary facilities and equipment to be purchased and for a period of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and operation.
After the exhaustion of the funding (2 years) the Company is required Arch.Design to operate the mini-kindergarten 3 more years at their own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year to complete, the company economy rating of the application process provided active assistance.
Takes care of the children worked very qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, kindergarten children can visit without restrictions by age, although most of them are over three years.
And since this involves a mini-kindergarten, while only 5 children may be present, but in the day switch off each other for several children.
The nursery operation is flexible to the needs of parents agreed that children of all employees in relation to the use of the kindergarten the same rights - regardless of the corporate hierarchy and their positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten yet comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children play here not only above all they are excellent lessons offered - from basic knowledge through to pre-school, by the way they learn English, too.
The classroom is equipped not only with creative toys and games, but with a computer which the children is available.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can always take a look at the children and so the stress eliminates the delay in collecting the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their time more productively.
No wonder that emerge here, natural and loyal employer-employee relations.
Arch.Design lined up so at the Czech companies that offer when recruiting new employees significant benefits that are family friendly and encourage such programs through their personnel marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric lizard that staircase as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are gaping fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local residents got the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone house."
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile and mosaic fragments that are reminiscent to shed facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these features typical for the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Only on closer inspection one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole facade is still vivid, dramatic and special being illuminated increases the brightness of the colors yet.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped timber copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements from doors, peep holes and even bars.
The House Batlló in the Eixample district of the busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No 43 was rebuilt from a house built in 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese pointed out.
The reconstruction took two years and completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of an entirely new building, but eventually he agreed to the idea of ​​Gaudí on an unusual and cheaper construction.
The apartment building Casa Batllo Antoni Gaudi designed not alone, however.
He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on the drawing board, the decorations were for the representative of the apartment property owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
In the design of the facade but also worked with several other sculptors and artists.
The joint work on the design of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Mila in Park Güell, in which there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local population of its organic forms because of the nickname "bone house."
Others called it the special window opening mechanism due to the "yawning house."
It also says at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia presented.
But even more sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house of a unique for its time central heating system with venting channels and traditional fireplaces.
Somewhat bizarrely seems its 45-degree tilt on already.
In his work consistently ignored Gaudí all that time building and was not swayed by them.
Before construction starts, although he took from the city of the appropriate planning permission but the information given by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers and two years later at the completion of the results were so horrified that they required help.
The senators met with, among other things, the fact that the construction interfered with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk.
came to change it but no longer quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the relevant request of the district presented Josep Batlló a request for approval to the hiring of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd Stock was a social room, third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building by running up a flight of stairs up to the roof terrace.
Due to the fundamental elements of the renovation all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by bent and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for interconnecting rooms.
The social part can be explained by the opening of the saloon doors combine completely and so a bigger company could chat easily without losing confidential conversations to have a certain intimacy.
The house was given by Gaudí's conversion except for a new facade, a very unusual roof and two floors.
It is also impressive Gaudí's play of light and the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the atria.
The interplay of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply set out the principle advantage that white reflects the light better than darker colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batllo, which was launched in 2005 in the World Heritage list of UNESCO can now visit everyone.
On the first floor the spacious and attractive accommodation is made available to the public.
The owners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the famous 150.Geburtstags Creator.
When they found out that this is a very lucrative business, they kept the visits at, so they expanded to include other common and the attic rooms, including from the roof terrace.
The price to visit the monument, however, is not chicken, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the admission fees to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
Who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon tower should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed frame right? Women have different needs than men
Not the most fantastic bed frame, but the quality of the bed - that mattress and rust make good bed.
These should complement each other harmoniously, however, to meet the needs of specific user needs.
In choosing to play a role in many things - the weight, size, health, and not least the gender of the sleeper.
Equally important is also the interior, which have mattress and rust subordinate.
A typical example?
In a weekend home, is not in the heated periodically, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they take a lot longer to "warm up."
In addition, they are much heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they have that is not enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and yet to lie on a hard drive, backs up to moisture: it is not impossible that forms beneath her horse.
In the selection also plays a role in what one is accustomed.
Who was extended overseas, where very high standard mattresses with soft layer is difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Probably all of hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that here they can not sleep properly."
"For their off Shun those shoulders, heels and hips, they need a soft layer of Visco foam (memory foam - a shape-memory polymer)."
"This, I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so they" can receive from the joints and skin bad "information, said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, I have worried some years ago many hockey players, but also other customers, this mattress with visco-foam (memory foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such services include the mattress manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer of Tropico."
And you have to be a famous hockey player is not necessarily to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape corresponding to the heat absorbed, in other words, he literally hugs the body to warm.
Nowhere is suppressed, the night rolls around you do not like after a heavy battle.
We sleep so much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against pressure ulcers (gangrene).
When choosing a mattress size to body size you should still expect the length of the soles added, that about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman who are in need, the 180 cm tall, so a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the risers should be at least 90 cm flat width available, this makes 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, 120 are attached to 140 cm.
Sake of comfort and also to any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal Bed Width: "If you lie on your back should be enough room for the slightly bent arms," ​​advises Ing Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who for years the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture dedicated and maintains this topic at schools.
With a double bed each with a distinct rust and needs its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also equal.
Otherwise there is no alternative when the grates to be installed in different heights and that's not possible with any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, with spring mattresses skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should account for the shape layer and fine upholstery.
"With the hand or when you sit down you can feel the springs in any case," warns Helen Prokopová.
Each mattress takes a special type of grid is required.
Soft beds with mattress and all-surface as grown together Siamzwillinge have to look for anything in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not lift the cover and can not wash it, what today is already common practice.
And since in a single night from 0.2 to 0.75 l loses sweat, it is clear that the mattress slowly after five to seven years to a huge (and clogged strainer) is.
And because of lean experts from advertising slogans, the promise of mattress to last up to 25 years and even lifetime warranty.
Each thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable cover, but it is advisable to use a mattress cover that can be easily washed and remove.
Although today are usually made mattress covers with full zipper, so you get after opening two halves (extremely important for washing and the washing machine size!), The manipulation seems larger mattresses, especially single run, much as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath on.
If they are in bed instead of a grating of a fixed disk?
Out with it!
Or at most for a bed for guests and unloved for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer the plate provided with ventilation holes (if not already have it) and use spring mattresses with skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine upholstery.
Polyurethane mattresses are not on such a surface.
For non-adjustable frames with 14 to 18 slats (slats) are latex or sandwich mattresses suitable (and possibly combinations of latex and coconut), always pay it grates with a large latte number of words of 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the ability to regulate the bar hardness.
On adjustable louvre gratings are no mattresses with spring frame, since they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the spring bars, special modules are offered flexible shoulder.
This involves a special attachment of the slats, making it possible to press the slats or even verwinkeln so as to enable the selective depression of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use in "Mr. Mattress" soft zones for the shoulder area.
Also to the ladies is intended - to begrudge them this soft zones in the hip.
For the most demanding customer point-elastic spring wing systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point elastic contact pads are designed with so-called Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure is distributed on several points, thereby reducing the tension.
But - if you use the right mattress and right grate a bad (too big and voluminous) pillows, most benefits are lost.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow is to support the head, its tip should only reach to the shoulders so the shoulder muscles to relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the side position the pillow should be offset (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) to shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have but with the former (filled with hay), straw bags in common.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
Even with mattresses is the new magic word "organic."
Instead of petroleum raw materials used for the preparation of polyurethane foams are increasingly naturelle oils - such as castor oil and soybean oil.
Soy is well used by all major manufacturers.
"Bio is for mattresses, which are its core materials from purely natural origin," Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus from the company explained.
Natural products are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first it was Aloe Vera.
You can treat yourself but also micro-capsules, spread the sleeping forest or fresh lavender scent.
Here, too, do you make a difference between men and women.
While used in the men a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves to absorb the mattress cover, the heat and cool the body, can have the references to women, "warming" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, it's the weaker sex is so nice and warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foam and visco-foam mattresses formed multi-zone, who know exactly where to head, hips and heels.
For a high quality mattress but you have to fork out more and 7000 crowns.
Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they apply for medical aid.
The first Czech company was Gumotex this advantage given.
You see, to save on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and merchants who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Thus offers the brand Magniflex Duofreeze the mattress with quilted during the Visco Memory Foam for 11,990 CZK to.
The second you get for free.
It was the Tempur material, which ushered in the era of the viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.
No wonder, they were still developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the enormous startup overloads.
Tempur softens with heat and in cool environment, it solidifies again.
It adapts to the body perfectly and distributed in an optimal way the body pressure.
It is not only ideal for preventing bedsores, but generally increased the sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products such as with special foot rests used, the legs and the vessels are designed to provide relief.
Domestic manufacturers use as the foams Eucatherm C, Twin Saver or similar products.
More and more parents want people to monitors, to have the kids under control
Fear for their own children grow, so consider more and more parents to monitor GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars can, that people everywhere as well, which would be helpful in such cases, most recently at the traceless disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková.
The unit is currently about the size of a cigarette pack but soon it should be no larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have added to the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, and they keep on the lookout for ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of a risk to their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that it refers not to spying, but about an effective way to reduce the probability that the tragedy is," continues to Petr Pilin from society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may in some cases to abuse of such devices, such as when someone puts it in his pocket, he knows that without it, but we have had no such case reported."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," added pilin.
In his opinion the child should always know what purpose is the "box" and how to use them in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bocková but points out that a child if there is such a thing might not wear it just gets rid of his.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to certain things on purpose to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"Even the mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among the parents, but they can be off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bocková.
In your opinion, is also debatable whether such a device in the event of an attack really helps.
"With the planned kidnapping of the kidnappers almost always controlled, whether the child has any electronics with you, with which it could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"When such monitors could find wider use, they would look for this as well, because their sales would be accompanied by massive safe advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police one step ahead," says the psychologist.
It does, however, that similar units in a sudden attack by a pedophile can be quite helpful.
Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring According to the tracking services for both cars, as well as providing for people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted as providing it reports the current position at certain intervals.
"Although it would be destroyed immediately, or at least is the last position of the affected person."
"With more expensive units even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if one falls down and lie motionless remains, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," said Mr Čech.
In his opinion, could perform similar services and intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need a special software einzuspielen.
The problem of the current detection devices is that it is either this device in a matchbox-size goes, the trailers are similar to or smaller mobile phones.
Always there is the risk that you lose.
Lord of the Pilin Macro Because, according to tests, therefore, in the presence of devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the attacker did not identify any needs that there is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he noted only after a certain time, which gives the police a head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development - towards bracelets or pendants, always with the same technology is used as the vehicle location.
So the combination of location feature using the GPS system (as well as for navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you wrap the whole Czech Republic but you could keep only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers fuses are ignited with explosive devices.
The year before, the Defense Department already 224 km fuse had delivered to the army camp.
It is to know reassuring that the military has safe hands for 225 years.
The only problem is the durability of the fuses - two and a maximum of four years.
The Army bought the fuses of the corporation STV Group, as for a paltry 40 million kroner.
In its reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of general staff said fuse MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually to the 60 kilometers fuse.
According to research by the Armeepyrotechnikern, the MF DNES spoke out, it is clear from this statement that the army would have to annually complete a very intense pyrotechnic training - of all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning ladies.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers fuses could reasonably justify.
This length corresponds to other 25,000 detonations.
Even so, this army would be enough stock for more than ten years.
But if there is the old rule by experts that are sufficient to train any new professional soldiers six feet fuse completely, then the army has carried these new acquisitions - has a calming stock for which - even in the light of the increased needs of the pioneer and specialist units mentioned 225 years created.
It complained of the rapid reaction brigade soldiers recently at Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no ammunition for small arms more so target practice the lack of resources are limited due to strong.
That of the trouser to mention.
"I will also not know why they buy from us such vast amounts fuses."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army a good customer, we want to come largely as a seller should," says the sales manager of STV Group January Decky.
Pejšek January, the Defense Ministry spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers fuse so that the army would have just become a cover for at least ten years with this "ammunition."
January Decky of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year life of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnician even just two years.
"With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them that wants to remain anonymous, to avoid being a soldier accused of criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the period of use any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and endangering the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defence of the quantity discount for the 445 km fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's supply of 244 kilometers," spokesman tells us Pejšek the position of the buyers of Defense.
Just for comparison: liquidate The annual consumption of fuses of pyrotechnics to the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet army, brother, for some years barely exceeds 1,500 meters.
And the police ordered only such amounts of ammunition they can use before the end of its life.
Even the safety of pyrotechnics because, well, keep to themselves as open to the possibility of purchases of more modern flexible and thus more reliable fuses.
The Defense Department already has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army in its campaign to the Rhine prepared.
According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES spoke to the Czech armed forces expected in a few years ago the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old fuses, it has today purchased "cheap."
To this day I do the contacts located, which I won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the "Small Businessman of the Year" Lukáš Pytloun have helped in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of last year of the competition "Small Businessman of the Year Award was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Only abroad he realized that it is missing in Liberec in good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holidays working abroad and using a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"This angered then-price-quality ratio me so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
All profits are invested back into the house immediately, which he then rebuilt step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he succeeded in just seven years of doing business in Liberec four guest houses, to open two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was, until recently, the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year was added another first-class hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the franchise Pytloun hotels already reported," the entrepreneur says number one last year.
"A large part of this license sales for the operation of the hotel had just won the contest" Entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr. Pytloun added appreciatively.
The victory has given him greater recognition, so popularity in Liberec and surroundings is introduced.
"People recognize me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I must say, that did really well," he recalls.
I definitely recommend it to all who want to create something to take part in this competition.
You need to win not the same, each visualization is good.
He says that he still made the contacts and friendships will take advantage, on which it would otherwise not come at all.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I think to this day regular business."
The fame associated with the success reflected in his opinion a little down on each of its employees.
And as he has in the seventies.
"I notice them at greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something, the universal recognition it deserves."
I see this is indeed not only as a personal success, no, that is the result of good work by all of us. "
"My name is just something brought to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was followed quickly by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its single-mindedness has Farmet the worst behind.
took the award for the first rank of competition Vodafone Company of the Year last year Karel Zdarsky, the owner of Farmet contrary.
The jury praised the efforts at that time, that he stamped out of the small tool in Česká Skalice a company from the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of transactions.
"I can say that this recognition not only encourages me, but also all of my employees and reinforces our confidence in the fight with the competition has," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when offered the government his father Karel Zdarsky as compensation for the seized by the Communists owned a small workshop to rent, he did not hesitate long, his career was in the company where he worked until then whiz, and started with a few friends of his father's own company to produce plastic tubs.
A short time later she began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automated presses in Central Europe.
But only by the success of the mentioned competition and its media coverage it has also entered into the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only can our customers with the brand Farmet exercise now more intense, and our foreign partners started the circumstance to be working with a company that has gained in their country the best possible deal to attach greater value," says Karel Zdarsky.
The past year was at Farmet however, not only in the sign of the euphoria of victory.
The assessment was on the economic performance of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And even 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tooling products.
The crisis that was still less the citizens, but shook especially companies, reached its peak now - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new equipment and technologies.
"This situation of course we could not miss."
"The sales went down by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even access to layoffs," said Karel Zdarsky
A viable enterprise must take sometimes unpopular measures such.
It succeeded, however, get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to make concessions - the investments in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and earned top prizes in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything testifies to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new winners, I wish you joy of victory - but in a relaxed atmosphere," can align Karel Zdarsky.
An opinion poll that does away with senseless rules
The opinion poll about the "absurdity of the Year" is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some nonsensical rules was already used to create the world.
On the dubious winner of the next year of the survey "absurdity of the Year became the duty to provide documents to authorities which are available online.
So it was decided more than a third of about four thousand voices issuing companies.
Social Security Administration will demand a paper statement from the Register, even if he had an official call by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll that's changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will require in future Social Security checks of paying no more excerpts from the Register," said the spokeswoman Jana Buraňová CSSA.
The purpose of the poll "absurdity of the Year" is to take all the rules and orders under the magnifying glass to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have set aside and the absurd.
This is the fourth time this year, part of a business competition, organized by the Czechoslovak economic newspaper (HN) and enjoys increasing popularity among the public.
If in the past year participating in the three thousand people in the vote, it was earlier this year four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, the one and only serve to hinder the company's activities.
"As far as the number of income tax forms, we occupy a front rank in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the association of small and medium-sized businesses and professionals in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity in recent years, the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, however, has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank takes the Czech Republic in terms of business conditions the 74th Rank one, compared to last year at eight places a worse position.
The absurdity of the Year competition was first proclaimed in the year and every year after playing the same scenario.
Any person may, from April up to the deadline of the competition in late September report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register the web address is www.firmaroku.cz. After that investigated the organizers of the competition seven candidates for the "anti-price" and the public can vote via the Internet website www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the one absurdity, which gets the most votes.
At this year's survey were filed more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders.
The tips are not only entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways are required to pay tolls or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must device every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November is on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening, regularly participate in the personalities of the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the association of small or medium-sized businesses and professionals in the paddling. Republic, and Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the paddling. Republic at the climax of the competition with the party.
"Where the state the entrepreneurs throwing spanners in the works, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal each year set aside at least thirty paragraphs, which today still unnecessarily complicate the entrepreneurs their enterprises," said Martin Kocourek, Minister with Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create, nonsensical arrangements of the world, are showing results.
In 2007, the most disturbed people, the obligation imposed on employers, the trade office at their place of permanent establishment report three days before the intention must be to want to take a stand for an exhibition or fair.
This requirement was repealed by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The requirement that the 2007 received the second largest number of votes - a duty to the employment agency missions by employees in the amount reported to have up to 30 days - was abolished by the Act to so-called "green card."
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was adopted that imposed physiotherapists, in the office of a mirror, a refrigerator and have to have two scales.
This regulation was the Ministry of Health this year to some extent mitigated - the fridge was off duty.

Pilsner Land Fund - arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen took the anti-corruption police on arrests in recent days.
Here, the local media entrepreneur and real estate agents Luboš G. of the detectives in handcuffs was led away.
This allegedly tried to tamper with a public competition currently taking place for the settlement of restitution claims so that the competition offered land fell to a concrete prospects.
This is said to have paid for G. Luboš half a million.
"At this point I can only confirm that the police pursued a person convicted of the offense of fraudulent practices in a public competition," said Antonie Zelena, head of the Pilsner prosecution of the newspaper "Pravo," further details of which it could in terms of current studies have not been granted.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur has been dismissed from the police again.
How he could manipulate the public competition, it can be, given the scarcity of official information only speculate.
The spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá led to the question put by Právo that the police had in the Pilsen branch of the Land Fund and this actually made arrests during a public competition.
"It was about a client and no means to one of our employees," it materialized.
The public competition was Mrs. Černá According to the correct name 'call for tender of claims for transfer of land under the Land Code "and would take place in cases where several applicants bezeigen interest in the offered property.
"These people have under the call of a higher value on the transfer of settled payments for restitution, as the proclaimed land value."
"According to the proposed claims the order is set by the potential acquirer, then the Land Fund of the land is transferred to the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman for the fund.
Luboš G. were obvious information, who had signed up to the request, and as he was authorized person himself, because he is a number of restitution claims had bought, he offered a real estate interests that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously, for a fat sum.
That would be a sufficient explanation as to why he had when he was arrested such a large sum of money with him.
Luboš G. had been in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner Land Fund.
He also played in the Cause of the former Chief of the Land Fund Václav Sankota a role that was prosecuted because he published in spare plots of land restitution, which had already been cut down to location decisions of construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired by the Land Fund, for example, land which was earmarked for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access highway to the industrial estate Borské pole was planned.
He later exchanged this very favorably with the City Council for a house in the historical center of the town where the value of the property far exceeded.
The City Council then had a heavy heart Kleinbeigeben to the construction project are not jeopardized by blocking the sites.
The housing costs of households increase by several hundred per month
The households from January to not only expect higher costs for all energy types, but also with higher water and sewage fees, and for district heating and in some places to grow rents.
Families be a month from January several hundred crowns more to be learned from the wallet than before.
Current is more expensive to 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent or more in some cities will be up to a tenth have to pay more for water supplies and in some places more expensive and the supply of district heating.
But the current inflation rate does the apartment homes each year a few hundred crowns more.
The power rates have been reduced here from all major suppliers, that is to blame is the significant promotion of electricity from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic panels.
Although gas is only moderately more expensive, though this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here also is a few hundred crowns more likely a year.
While electricity and gas in the Czech Republic are more expensive, the prices of district heating from city to city are different.
Above all major towns planning price increases.
Must, for example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové district from January to pay each month up to 50 crowns more, more than 1,000 crowns a year pay more families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague in turn threaten 9 percent higher water and sewage fees, and this for the case that the city increase the rent infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague's outperformance of the Czech Republic, will continue to be the lowest.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, to water and sewage charges rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rent increases are likely, for example, into 140,000 apartments, which falls away from January, the so-called Mietregulierung.
Is planning, for example, the housing companies Byty CPI, which has in Usti nad Labem in 2500 homes, raise the rents from January to equal one hundred percent.
Who does not agree with this rent increase, the court will prosecute the company.
The regulated rents that you pay today in almost 300,000 homes are expected to rise next year by more than 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum, beer and Fernet out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, in exceptional cases even a good whiskey, one has stolen his father from the house bar.
These are the drinks must be drunk after eating notbehandelt Czech teenagers under fifteen most frequently.
No exceptions are children who have repeated their cat sleep in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the recording of the Children's wards in hospitals.
"Beer and wine are completely out of fashion because it simply takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clear hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikan, the head physician of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Hořovice clinic.
"Whiskey, if it is possible to steal a bottle from the Father of the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka can have the advantage that you mix it with juice, then he does not smell as strong," said the chief doctor.
is the speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová him right.
"Most often it is about Fernet or rum"
"This is the current trend of alcohol, especially in primary schools."
"Occasionally it was also about plum brandy, which can take one of the home," led to Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chief Medical Pelikán thirteen-or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the long hospitalization are no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working this year, he spent ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol hospital where the ambulance drunken students from near and far delivered should.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career with 12 years ago when it was first with 3.5 per mille alcohol in the blood and more, in combination with the" "was taken" ecstasy, the physician described a very serious case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holesovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother never seemed strange that her daughter came home 48 hours," marvels the chief doctor.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance for bumping with their own offspring is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism in children.
A real function in the true sense of the word experts say it's not in children.
"In many years of chronic alcoholism addiction is to understand the alcohol, together with all related phenomena and this is not the case with these kids."
For those who enjoy alcohol again, mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán.
The Speaker of the Motol hospital, according to Mrs. Jurinová, were sent to mid-November about forty drunken children in the local Department of Child and Adolescent Medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which made hospitalization necessary shall be reflected in the statistics.
Drunken children who are brought to outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police back home are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink just so a bottle of liquor in the school there in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes, which absolutely rely on is: Walpurgis Night, New Year and the end of school year.
"The latter two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad product or joy to the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis Night I have experienced too drunk for seven children at one time in the recording," says Dr. Pelikan.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better off as a child who has to fight the next day with a nasty hangover.
The headache the morning after that result from dehydration and lack of glucose, you can sell that is in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" glorious "experience at night, they wake up in a good mood without something hurting somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. A pelican, taking the patient by at least sometimes spoil the good mood by giving them lists the costs they will cost treatment.
For the transport by ambulance and the night come good in an acute bed and like a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Every now and again I have used it as a means of education, if I had put paid directly to the children at the visit, which cost her drunkenness, and that it can happen that they sometimes work the whole vacation on need, the money for a single to make such a party, "added Dr. Pelikan.
He believes that the health insurance companies do not intend to recourse procedures, the demand for the healing of drunken children necessary costs of the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five who has the Czech Ministry of Defence against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M exchanged are on Tuesday flew in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS located.
It is the first time that these aircraft are in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, it had been seen only in maneuvers or air shows.
At issue here is the ability to fly two-seater version of L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three are single-seat L-159.
These are currently in einkonserviert Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - it has taken over the past week.
When they despatched from the aircraft physically Vodochody, is Jan Pejšek, the Defense Ministry spokesman, according to yet unknown.
The single-seat combat aircraft L-159 were again separated from long-stored aircraft and this without additional funding and investment from the Department of the Ministry.
"Were the two-seat L-159T1 replaced in the current state and look," said Pejšek the newspaper Pravo.
He added that the army would not have to make do without two-seat fighter aircraft, since the Ministry of Defence signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million contract for the renovation of four redundant L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft acquired by the army in July, the second they will take until the end of this year.
Pejšek According to EADS has pledged to enforce the fighters in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly stated that the company buyers of the EADS aircraft L-159, and that those services are intended to train pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is a matter for the purchaser, the manner in which he realized the cause," led Pejšek.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 to a transport aircraft and the Casa purchasing additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor last year had been approved yet by the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Defense Department had announced at that time to purchase any invitation to tender, but said EADS directly.
The former defense official argued that this exchange will help the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought from Aero 72 aircraft, of which she uses only 24, she wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft would incidentally also have legal repercussions.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence namely the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have to select the aircraft due to a very European call and no means by talking to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, the last to land within fourteen days at the airport Kbely.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to relate to the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can be used as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this in particular to sixty men," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine the case, what men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health problems, she added Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009 she followed with their counterparts in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study of the index finger of right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men was the same probability of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were of equal length.
In men, the index finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33 percent, or sixty men as much as 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned that form already in the prenatal age reflects clearly the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research showed that just accelerates the testosterone, growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences told CTK, bowing to him that this study, yet he considered the relationship between finger length and cancer risk has not been for "proved completely.

In the region Hodonín in the field of White Carpathians is called for caution.
On the streets, which may be scattered from a conservation reasons only with inert dusts, there is a thick up to five inches of snow cover, led to CTK.
In the Czech Republic were 2:00 to 10:00 centimeters of fresh snow, mostly in northern Bohemia - locally up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region were up to 15 inches of new snow.
In the Czech Republic there to hear it slowly to snow on.
American soldiers have a new "smart gun."
The American troops in Afghanistan for the first time used a new "smart" weapon, which so far is only known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super accurate gun.
Their projectiles are in fact guided by lasers with an accuracy of only a few meters to the finish.
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain high explosive work, almost like little grenades.
The missiles can be programmed so that they can not just explode on impact with the target, but at any point of its ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use it against an enemy that is behind a barrier - a wall or hide in the trenches.
From above, it is in fact usually not protected, the murderous steel fragments from above him, then rain can easily put out of action.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of XM-25 is the new battle rifle, the first infantry weapon that makes the "smart" technology advantage.
"The soldier is in fact so taken before: he aims at the target and emits a laser beam, which determines the distance, it gains an accurate sighting point, after which he corrected the increase in angle, then he need only pull the trigger yet.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"If one pulls the trigger to charge the weapon and fired a bullet to the distance from 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs to be relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocated its office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July next year will move 400 employees their jobs from the old office building at Marienbad "in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moved its office in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the Computer and its maintenance specialized industry giant on Wednesday announced that in July next year, 400 women and men their jobs from the old office building at Marienbad "in Bad Homburg in the Astro embarrassed Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyons Road in Frankfurt district Niederrad.
A spokesman for Fujitsu said, should ultimately there another 100 jobs the company will be accommodated, which were previously spread across the region.
The Accommodation was very attractive, also the open-plan offices came in the workings of the Astro Park employees receive better.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had been merely tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent access to the airport is just for a global company like Fujitsu is of great importance.
The recent relocation of a major company in the region said yesterday show joy at the winners and disappointment of the losers.
The Frankfurt Economic Affairs Officer Mark Frank (CDU) said, was thus again been won a "Global Player."
This was a "great location commitment.
Fujitsu passe to the city, the settlement was an important impetus for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) deplored the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was soon by the management was informed of the intention.
"We have of course the company offered our help," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts would, however, can not change the difficulty of the computer manufacturer and the owner of the properties at Marienbad place.
Ultimately, economic reasons have made the difference.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building was cooperative."
The Fujitsu previously occupied house on the town square and the adjacent "Small Vertical 'were among the other buildings in the Marie Bader place ten years ago to the most controversial building projects of the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private developer's project was created between the station and town hall, a new Stadtentree, both because of the massive building of some previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings provided for criticism.
2001 was the investment advisory and rating agency Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and was still associated with computer maker Fujitsu Siemens houses.
The building was used by Fujitsu acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Opportunities Group, together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Who lives in Tokyo, Fujitsu-Konuzern describes itself as the third-largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies such as computer and server and also provides the necessary service.
The subsidiary in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, far more employees, however, Fujitsu is one in Munich.
From Bad Homburg draws its subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
By contrast, in the office building Astropark rented 7,000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout to - Among others, the Central Association of Electrical and Electronics Industry its headquarters
Amazon locks Server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly coming under pressure.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the unveiling of his platform servers.
You may put political pressure behind after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic telegrams.
Wikileaks founders Assange allegedly keeps in England.
The unveiling platform Wikileaks gets into the United States are increasingly under attack.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking to the Internet home in Europe.
The prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman said while other countries and companies for a boycott of Wikileaks.
Wikileaks and founder Julian Assange that appears on the wanted list of Interpol is to stay after a newspaper report in the UK.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," shared the investigative activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time) with.
Shortly before the internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents had been banished from its servers.
The Internet activists had in publishing the secret diplomatic telegrams on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) are used to cope with the high traffic to the documents.
Twitter explained by Wikileaks continues to step: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to deal with people in Europe."
When Amazon had this problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon have stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks, after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had made inquiries, the CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened a boycott of Amazon, told the British Guardian.
"I would have liked to see that Amazon is taking this action earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the result of denying the platform in other countries to use to servers.
"Wikileaks" illegal, outrageous and reckless approach to our national security is at risk and endangers lives around the globe, "also mentions a statement by the independent senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - Wikileaks should help in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founders Assange, who is wanted for rape suspect by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent to keep the 39-year-old Australian in the UK, the precise location was known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist, has called the investigation in Sweden as always intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore rightly fear for his safety Assange said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founders will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried and executed for treason.
In Canada, said an aide to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama "could use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange meanwhile broke out a slugfest.
The speaker of President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Foreign Minister had called Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recently become known spy calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far more significant than its a website."
The U.S. government now provides comprehensive protection of their databases to the test.
As Special Representative was the deputy director of the Center for Anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers was appointed, said the White House.
Travers was responsible for "structural reforms" to develop, which are following the disclosure of the Embassy reports by Wikileaks become necessary.
The White House wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanging information and protects.
The U.S. government also announced to want to ensure the safety of dissidents and most active, if it fell through the Wikileaks release in danger.
"We have done everything to contact them in touch," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them, if that be necessary."
The ice-University
On the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice-cream are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest feed and visitors from around the world.
Where does all the ice?
From Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere on some old-fashioned German of the ice cream maker is to apply the cream to her all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio collected with a spatula the ice from the refrigerated counter, she sweeps into the wafer and then sells them.
To know this, you must not drive after Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who still want to know more about ice, can not pass on the "Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University has set up ice, the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so the ice cream from its machines throughout the high Italian best values.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest feed and visitors from around the world.
There are also multi-day special courses and internships around the chocolate ice cream in our own ice cream parlor.
Some people dream in the mid-life crisis of a new career, others just venture onto ice smooth their vague yearnings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary and Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and will in the land of industrial ice-cream offer in the future, a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is a consultant and wants after years in a nerve-wracking job something of my own bagging.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia's because children love their Italian ice cream.
Maestro Luciano Ferrari Gelatiere explained to the participants, first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The point is not only good taste but also the silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the national and even southern superstructure 'Italian Gelato is simply the best - and still is a lot of romance here. "
The first step in the production seems very simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which is heated with an electronic program all at 85 degrees and then immediately cooled to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine to a faucet and out comes a white base pasteurized cream, foundation for all Milcheissorten.
Is immediately assailed the instructor with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream with only natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How to give your own desire to experiment free reign?
Luciano warned to be led astray by the spirit of the times.
Those of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" speech, perhaps using them anyway stabilizers - usually a product of nature, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, but it must be sold within a day, or it collapses into itself, and the customer bites loud ice granules.
Some variations of the matrix are allowed.
More exciting is it with the flavors.
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguish between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"The suppliers are all trying to palm you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment times."
Either in fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even at the ice cream out of the white matrix, which is yellow to cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now, students will be distributed to the ice machines.
Luciano, they can produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla or other natural supplements.
The same experiment can be subjected to the fruit ice.
More flavor, more fruit puree - the taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not taste absolutely nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The popular Kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix lift the taste of Gelato out properly, "says Luciano.
Ice cream is a question: peach puree is used with lots of sugar, the sugar content are reduced in the basic recipe.
Lemon ice for an extra helping of sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of fruits (wine measure so that Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately tables facilitate the computation.
to make ice cream does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for automatic preparation of the matrix helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture struck simultaneously creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation stay small margins is not enough.
The Brazilian Gustavo blotted himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he gets the oversized blender out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Safety Authority had been "infiltrated by the experimenting with GM crops industry.
This charge now formulated, the expert group test Biotech, which sees itself as an independent institution for the assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," Test Biotech CEO Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA experts had in years, the association ILSI lobbyists under contract.
Who is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper had significantly contributed to the EFSA testing of GM crops and therefore am in a clear conflict of interest criticized Then.
The EFSA rules are intermittently identical to position papers from the ILSI and contribute to the signature of the industry which will be under the control of the Authority in Parma, Italy.
It was the second time that Testbiotech bemängle a conflict of interests.
So be a senior manager recently Efsa without conditions, or transition period to the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and I have changed so that the pages.
Also, the Central German Radio (MDR) was recently unveiled personal connections between the controlling authority and EU industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environmental Agency as well as MEPs hear everything.
EFSA, however, can not see any conflict of interest.
They resort to all legitimate data, including those of the industry, provided they are of high technical quality, it said in a statement.
From the experts working for EFSA, asking you not think they have any contacts with industry.
You would have to disclose this but.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
This refers to himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying job.
In criticizing the field of independent experts such as Then, that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding study in animals and will not test the reaction of GM crops to environmental effects.
"We want to know what makes, for example, genetically modified maize on the field," said Then.
Current practice, only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant is to test, what do not provide reliable results.
"If the risks are not looking for, how can you find them?" Then asks accusingly.
The Angelika Hilbeck also agrees.
The scientist conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zurich.
The industry attempts in this field as in the U.S. now also in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit.
There is therefore hardly researchers who were not intertwined with corporations.
For business critical studies would not usually published.
"The industry controls the security research," says Hilbig.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell has also concerned that, in total about 400 pounds.
On Monday evening he was standing in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the diggers moved in and began to break off a large chunk of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrating against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to stop the building, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer coquina, a soft coarse stone, built 1914-1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can not disappear."
He says: "A cheap and poor stone, earth and easy way."
When he aufsägte one and got the smell of cigarette smoke.
What will he do with the scraps, he does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli also Gsell.
The trail of Stuttgart stones into a forest near Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone-kingdom.
The 44-year-old is with stones.
He bought all that were incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would ground into gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a guard house.
Insulted and threatened to have him, he says, than in September was in the newspapers that he the remains of the north wing was bought by the demolition contractor.
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he has told them that he could do nothing now but for the demolition.
And what if it happened once, it was still the most sensible, if the stones were reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of an average of 80-pound blocks with, unit price from 6.50 to 14 €.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it for a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half stored in the forest, the rest is long since sold.
Gardeners, landscapers, homeowners.
From everywhere they came and were dragged off, which could carry luggage and trailers.
The Stuttgart stumbling blocks have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," said Rongen.
"Would not the political component."
He gets in his SUV, making a tour through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law and canceled later biology, he was interested in computers and eventually become stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones he stores.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he was the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He slowed down.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstone.
"They were once at Dresdner Marie Bridge," he says.
Elbe, yellow, warm, he says.
"My favorite stone."
There goes the way up through the forest.
He points to a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station.
And again.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the blocks were part of the grandstand of the Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow bricks and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral Saint Blaise, tuff from Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
If Rongen think about how the stones were once carved by hand and controlled by simple pulleys and ox carts, it is quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if we were to shred something."
Rich he did not become filthy rich even less.
But 14 people of the stone traders employed today, have also settled in the forest at the top of stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a horticulturalist.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the remaining brokers.
Soon he has to Cologne.
Also there will be saved stones.
Battle for talent with high potential
There is a lively crowd at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the carmaker Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
know and, incidentally, Volkswagen - In a kind of competition of ideas they are talking shop with VW developers on the car of the future.
In the contest for the best and brightest, many companies now go into the melee and place, such as VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: the most talented graduates as early as possible to recruit in the lecture halls before entering the labor market and are courted by others.
And because universities do not release the records of the achievements of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and loyalty.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig touted by the car company for talent.
A young lady from the HR department distributed pens, sweets and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and jobs for students and shows them ways in the Group.
Nicole Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig in charge of the project with VW.
He also sees benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, look at some interesting candidates in detail and think, who would you as an employee in question."
Such cooperation, so Selle, are not unusual.
New, that will be courted as aggressively to the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," said Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, their employees, companies can no longer choose from a wide array of candidates.
But they have to advertise courtship and especially for skilled workers.
Above all, graduates of engineering disciplines are used in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI in October were more than 40,000 engineering positions unfilled.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG Dykta novel goes to the talent hunt.
He organized elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a sort of scavenger hunt where participants have the basis of GPS coordinates to find their way.
Eight promising students will send the company so next year across the USA.
By the way, participants can view KPMG's branches and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to decide in two rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidate flies to the U.S..
In the cut and thrust to the high potentials at the universities of the guns, according Dykta are getting bigger.
"We want the race apart from the crowd."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunters Dykta the bill seems to be working.
"We have to date with all participants in a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing their conclusion and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to direct lovers on campus has been mainly small and medium-sized enterprises also very classic in career fairs, on the prowl.
"We are trying to reach students at trade fairs."
"Some of Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, personnel manager at the Solar World Solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs about 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe aware of the coming issue.
Currently, the company's Web site 35 positions are being advertised.
"It's just very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solar World is cooperating with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced at the Solar specialists.
But the company tried to recruit other benefits for themselves: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can not often offer a large corporation," says HR manager Stübe.
Money is in finding a job is no longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solar World documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th Place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute publishes an annual list of top German employers.
To this end, it asked employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the environment for the employees.
Human Resources Manager Stübe expects from the Placement and a bonus for the job seekers.
"I think candidates look particularly for external reviews of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long term strategy, a reputation as an employer.
He advises his clients to greater authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way out to make themselves attractive as an employer and its employees," he says.
In industry jargon is called the internal employer branding, employer branding that is within their own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and they identify themselves with the company, they would advertise all by itself with friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"It's like a game with ties," said Kriegler.
Obama will stop new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico will be available in the coming years, no new oil drilling.
A similar ban adopted by the government in Washington - and revoke its earlier plans for good.
Also off the Atlantic coast remain new wells for the time being prohibited.
This was announced by Home Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Trigger for the strict ban that will apply for at least the next five years, the explosion of the rig Deepwater Horizon "in April.
Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven works and the largest environmental disaster in the U.S. led Barack Obama to pressure the opposition and the industry had indicated its willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf with, is still not clear conclusion.
The focus of the critique of the British energy giant BP, which is faced with billions of claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is during December to present their results.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the sanctions after the explosion drill stop.
Following several oil companies had submitted applications for new drilling projects at once.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations do Obama and Salazar exclude a natural hazard.
Currently, the inspection service, which was exposed to numerous allegations of corruption a bad name, fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced plans to include lucrative tax breaks for the oil and gas companies.
The industry warns now publicly warning that the delivery would be in the Gulf by a more stringent regulation will be significantly lower than before.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brake on the growth of oil and gas industry," the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO is - even before the Bohrverbot on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investment in new mining projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers of oil is brown, it smells like at the pump: billion gallons of spilled crude oil have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Do not be plagued from" calms the Ökoaktivist the journalists: "You will now get enough oil sludge from the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following the attempt to scan a wading chest-deep in water boy with the surrounding streaks: In the rainbow sheen of water, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that hover beneath the surface of brown oil fumes is not visible.
They used to have here collected buckets of shrimp, Esther badomen told on the shores of Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water was completely dead
Five years ago, poured from a ruptured pipeline tons crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to row now six hours to get into fish-containing waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta located Ogoniland is one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the criss-crossed by rivers, mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation is apparent.
Instead of bright water stirs the motorboat on brown stock, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees extend like black licorice sticks from the ground, sad to hang occasionally encountered their palm fronds.
Flocks of birds, as they are in wetlands usually the case, one searches in vain: when the outboard motor is silent, is spreading like a gas station in the former paradise smelling of eerie silence.
"What happened here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari says gloomily: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of ​​the Ogoni is fought for decades battlefield: Here penetrated more than 60 years, the first Explorateur from Europe, here was organized in the 80's with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistor, in this case had the shell Group in 1993 to close its production because it was too dangerous for the oil workers.
Even today, the company refused to return to Ogoniland: While three times from the entire Delta region the size of Switzerland with over 5000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines every day more than two million barrels of black gold pumping, are the oil fields fallow in Ogoniland to the group is unstable the situation.
Every few hundred yards rise steel frames and bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas tree" the heads of the drill holes are called much too affectionate.
They are up to 50 years, most corroded to the core.
Again and again, cracking up such a drill head, said Akpobari, then trough a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion gallons have flowed according to expert estimates, in 50 years the ecosystem of the Delta: Year after year, the amount of oil as it urged the sinking of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuing eco-case scenario, it is argued.
While the Shell Group makes sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell Nigeria put in much lower safety standards, as is usual in the world, accused the U.S. scientists Richard Steiner of the Group 2008: Only the rate of defects in the lines was "higher by far than anywhere else."
In a place that looks remotely like an abandoned oil-stained garage under the open sky, emerge from the mangroves figures: they are naked and smeared with oil up to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, some identify scattered randomly on the site, flickering fire: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, said Michael, director of the group.
First, gasoline comes through the pipes into the collection cup, and later drips at the end of the line out and finally diesel fuel.
Michael and four staff to produce it every day up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel, "This brings us 34 000 naira - about 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the country's largest oil-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The can with just under 40 euro cents per liter diesel ridiculously low price to undercut the illegal boiler still, because they get their raw material free.
He is from "bunkers" that tap into the network of pipelines across Ogoniland: In this way the country are daily, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million gallons of crude oil lost.
Only a tiny proportion of the raw material is stored temporarily between refined but illegal: the lion's share of fill organized criminal networks that will include high-ranking politicians and military, its will in tankers and him on the world market.
The debate about whether the disaster is due rather to the machinations of the population or lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari holds for purely academic.
"If the oil companies, not perceived as intruders and they would have destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly, it would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, is the ratio of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a subtraction of the group would qualify, "Maybe yes imagine other nationalities like the Chinese out to be better."
Since Michael is nervous.

Investigators discover dangerous structural defects in A380 engines
The A380 is obviously a big security problem.
Investigators in the investigation of a downed machine detected a possible structural defects, which could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas will now sue the motor manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus emergency landing early November, apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian air safety agency has found in its investigation a major security problem in the engines of some A380s - and is warning of a possible construction errors.
The potential defect could have severe consequences: An oil hose connection he could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, said in a statement published on Thursday the authority ATSB.
This would lead to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Affected were manufactured by Rolls-Royce engines in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Below that is the Qantas Airbus, on 4 November in Singapore had to make an emergency landing.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
They filed a statement of claim at a an Australian Federal Court in Sydney to allow him further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
A fire in the engine itself had dissolved and damaged parts of the wings.
Rolls-Royce made from an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now be replaced worldwide up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators announced that they carry out further safety tests on the superjumbo, which are equipped with affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was important to be sufficient to inform all interested parties.
After the emergency landing of Qantas machine, the airline had its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines had about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.

Thousands mourn dead buddy
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the buried miners were declared after several explosions at a mine to be dead.
Still, the bodies could not be salvaged, as the security situation in adversity well is more precarious.
About two weeks ago it came in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62 years were buried underground.
A probe was lowered into the shaft accident, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions could go down for safety reasons no emergency personnel.
After the second violent explosion, the authorities and experts had assumed that there is no chance of survival for the miners longer exists.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now remembered relatives and friends with a memorial to the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in glorious sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
Two minutes they were silent.
In honor of the buried miners 29 tables were set up to see where helmets, lights, and the names of the miners were.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing and sailboards found their place here.
Outside government buildings in the country waving the flags at half-mast.
New Zealand was hoping that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never come home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son while he did not see his corpse, Drew said Lawrie, whose son, Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the ceremony.
The first explosion on 19 November was also a mountain people of British and South African origin were buried.
Rescue workers began to clear a fire inside the coal mine in the South Island of New Zealand.
When the explosive gases will be replaced, started to cool the red-hot temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, soldier!
Fits to splatter art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores new fighters from his epic "Valhalla Rising" old genre boundaries.
To which audience likes the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought, as he has "Valhalla Rising" filmed?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his tormentors and places with almost superhuman powers rows of his opponents to - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, just because our hero like rabid killing methods served and its enemies ever tear the guts out of the living body, if he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye says, as he is known in fact, the whole movie about nothing, and the other figures can be at most times to one or two sentences or carried away a few agonizing death cries.
Otherwise, silence and the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland reveled that offers the Viking world of a millennium ago the backdrop.
Ideal for more adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and quiet camera movements.
Nice if a movie has multiple audiences pity, only if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, since its wild and drug dealer-styled trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino refuses, but stoic, make his work accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutal to the Arthouse.
Most art Cinema fans should feel let down by splashing around the brain or the intestines.
The latest action fans will die of boredom when One-Eye breaks free from interpretable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and is stuck forever in doldrums and fog before the team appeared to arrive in America and continue still.
No wonder then, that has "Valhalla Rising" in Germany found a movie rental and is now available only on DVD.
This is especially for the fabulous pictures a shame, but also because it is hidden behind the pretentious facade to a sometimes bloody exciting piece of cinema that deserves attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a compelling plot, it's all atmosphere, a film had become a fever dream.
And from which there is no escape for the audience.
Refn begrudge him hardly a moment of relaxation and strangled him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, especially with the incredible hatred that proposes to meet him in the heart of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, One-Eye is the loyal support of preserves such a thing as innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but the enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, might as Ambassador of the Devil itself
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already spoiled.
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can admire and hate, to the annoyance, excitement and wonder.
An experience.
Enigmatic earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country defends itself, however, to comment on it - yet it allows for checks.
Around midnight on 5 to 6th September 2007 attack at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes I a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates, the nearest large town, 30 miles away, Dair is as-Saur.
Your name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it goes around the reactor, which Syria has allegedly built with help from North Korea in the cube hidden in a valley that branches off from the stream.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA of 2008 would be the end of April under the name of the nearby village of al-Kibar reactor was common well-suited to produce plutonium - from the could build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, the technique is good in the fifties hardly.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
Using computer animation to a hidden, where the components are said to have the reactor before the destruction, a reduced copy of the North Korean model is from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
They also presented photos showing the building up close, or even the interior.
The reactor had been scheduled to begin operations, it said, was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than before, so the puzzles were rather larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack but was pretty sure that Syria build a reactor in al-Kibar, but saw little evidence that in the country " an active nuclear weapons program was ."
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and would rather only speak of an "alleged reactor," even if they hold the CIA presentation to "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is, a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said succinctly in the summer only, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" managed to hurry while the Syrians bulldozed the site thoroughly and set aside.
Nevertheless took place in June 2008 IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium that had been made by people.
In addition, the IAEA received via a Member State of commercial satellite imagery providers in the period immediately after the attack, which might be more useful than the CIA presented.
However, these recordings on the market are not getting because of the unknown customer - maybe Israel - it has bought exclusive.
The IAEA can not verify their authenticity, therefore, independent.
Syria has always maintained, never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor to have.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the IAEA pointed to the analysis of the particles back as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as on satellite images.
In addition, it denied the inspectors, a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed building.
But Israel is silent iron.
"We will comment on that before," reiterated most recently, at the time of the attack, acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
Then drags the investigation of the case back inconclusive since June 2008 and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Authority, as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA admits in Vienna - after a serious breach of the NPT is in the air, watches over the the IAEA.
As the key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions to be "operably linked" to the alleged reactor - and differently as this still exist.
The inspectors have been disclosed or to which assets it is, or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, will intern at the IAEA referred to as Marj al-Sultan, and Masyaf Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and satellite images at a building complex made Masyaf locate where it is most likely one of the suspicious object is.
It may be in or close to a military base - exactly denied on that basis Syria IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be pushed forward by the United States to spy on military installations.
For the nuclear detectives were due to tip the U.S. intelligence became aware of the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that was between the three towns on the Euphrates and the square footage to and fro.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "in connection with the fuel production" are.
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities," ie uranium enrichment and reprocessing processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is indeed powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later, the plutonium would be separated for the bomb to these key questions is at best a plausible conjecture.
It is also unclear whether debris that might hold valuable traces were stored at the three locations.
As hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the earth, no one wants to have information about where the rubble is left.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River Mine located al-Tibni of Syria in 1998 under investigation for use as storage for radioactive waste is, the IAEA is unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in conjunction with reactor.
Images from orbit show that Syria at the three sites suspected undertook earthworks and large container removed once the IAEA had requested access.
This may be coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA had used several months on developing a plan for inspections there, it would allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - but the effort shows how great is the interest of inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus and ironed from this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna were not appeased a year ago, the reactor was so destroyed, so did the cause no great urgency, as U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies takes a few months old so-called special inspections into the game, one of the sharpest agent that the Wiener atom has authority to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would propose such inspections, has indeed already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but still he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: First, it needs for a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented in it are anything but eager for an escalation.
to consider the other as a diplomat is: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie has begun in the summer to work on their yet unnamed debut as a director, there is trouble.
The screenplay she wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man
Little more is known about it - but even that's enough for concern.
Stubbornly keeps the rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman fall in love, during the war in Yugoslavia in their Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's organizations have protested immediately, whereupon some were planned days of shooting in Sarajevo moved quickly to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported now - even Jolie is an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
Diplomatic she is not - it has a few weeks ago the women ever offered a meeting in Hungary, which were opposed, however.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps had not existed and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tell her enough about the script.
Your organization has recommended to the UN Refugee Agency According to Jolie dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly is written scenes for Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, to read her script was added, after some argument, granted permission to film Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie was not then anyway.
The young author herself asserts, involved no political intentions with this film have to be working with a lot of effort into the Yugoslav conflict, would show the terrible consequences of war and give all interested parties a voice.
The contents of it, however, remains vague.
So still a second Synopsis circulated to the film in the network, then it sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other is already before the war, and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is abducted in a Serbian camp in which he as a guard work.
What after all significantly different sound than the variant "rape victim in a crush torturer."
That Jolie's film actually starts even before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, and Jolie was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now you can probably only the hackers gain peace of Hollywood: By the script, like so many before, make illegal online.
Get out of here
This evening it finally works again right around the Irishman.
No trace of sadness.
But the home team's guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA dominated too much.
The fans howl for joy when crashing loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in the southern Irish Cork quakes, because the players throw ping pong balls over a three-meter distance in the beer mug - and take.
"Bierpong" called the bizarre spectacle of winning there are 500 € prize money plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this shrill drinking game and the modest computer that does not really fit together.
And yet tries to amuse the 26-year-olds here to distract himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His route is not fun in Las Vegas, he is interviewing in January in New Zealand.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I have no work there."
After all: His girlfriend is waiting in Auckland already on it - "she had jerk, jerking her dream job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home already have two of Tanner's three children sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners is the situation on the island in many families.
100 000 Ireland will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI ahead in Dublin.
Until 2015, they expect even with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants, a violent loss.
The forecasts will come true, it is comparable to a wave of emigration to that under which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of boom, which brought great prosperity to Ireland with it again now makes wide sadness.
The economic crisis is uncertain primarily the young, educated Irishman, for which there are currently only went uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Each was used, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, however, without three of ten women and men under thirty work.
are in the Irish Times letters abound of young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the river in Ireland."
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers -. But who can go away and our country loses an entire generation"
"The last one then please out the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, provides pull up a bleak future because the administration is operating only window dressing and the young people offer no future anymore.
"You reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy, such as new jobs are to be made," says the 20-year-old.
They watched as their fellow students shimmy from an unpaid internship to the next.
Their greatest worry, she says it is having to emigrate in four years itself.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In this case try men like Stephen McLarnon occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organized the "work inga broad expo," an exhibition that provides a full service on working abroad.
"For young professionals working abroad is still a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website shows photos in Australia surfers and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan know in six months.
Because for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland was nothing more to do, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pull up a fashion house.
In January, we continue to Hanover and Berlin, to the next project.
His home O'Donovan now sees only rarely, because it causes extra shifts in order to pay off the mortgage on his house at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he steps in a long time for the first time over the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as good as ever again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes through the cooled rooms.
The little house in an upmarket residential area with manicured front yards, park in the driveways big, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 € - 100 percent loan financing.
"They were crazy times, it was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, after pouring hot tea and says: "I have no children, by which I must feed them and I am young, and even when everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer may not be the wailing, the moment he hears often.
"No one should go hungry - but our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, which is not the worst thing that can happen -. Perhaps, we feel this only as an Irishman"
He laughs and then tells of his father, who has gone into the last major economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was there again and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
The future can open and see just how it goes with life elsewhere.
A couple of years working in London when he has nothing behind them and why it should not in New Zealand was going well for him and his girlfriend?
One thing is there but that it these days, duly alarmed: the celebration of his 27th Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it might turn into a farewell party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and takes a long swig of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Call it rather a Weggehparty, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The routine demokatrische
The movement for democracy in Latin America is stronger, so as to support private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.
These results were the Latinobarómetro survey which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey is conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in the region.
Two figures fall in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in the eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased dramatically (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing annually since 2002 by about 6% and the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy from the sharp drop last year recovered, such a trend can be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Ca. 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. They are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values ​​are the same as last year, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crises have undermined the efforts for more democracy.
That this continued even during the Depression, there may be the fact that the Latin American countries experienced a short recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were offset by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong differences in mood (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread belief in progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and have increased violent crime, this is less the case.
For only the second time since the beginning of many survey respondents see in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Ca. 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. However, compared with 38% last year, the values ​​declined and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The growing economic power is reflected in the increasing support for the private and the market economy: about 71% of respondents nationwide indicated that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (see Chart 6).
Ca. 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of people in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% for private sector), although her left president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has, according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see in the U.S., the most influential country, and this role is in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua is from Venezuela.
An election rout
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the concerns of election officials who rushed to help the beleaguered country, by far.
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just some of the problems.
Polling stations opened with an hour-long delay.
Many Haitians, many of which were caused by the earthquake in January, homeless wandering around, looking for a choice.
Some finally gave all up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several suspected leaders demanded for an alleged fraud, the annulment of election results.
Throughout the country there were some violent protests.
Nevertheless, called Edmond Mulet, head of the UN Mission in Haiti, the choice "to be quite good in many respects."
According to a careful statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "to make these irregularities so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority said the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin required is that preliminary results on 7 Proclaim December.
The expected run-off election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirland Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity action.
If Célestin Jew who finds among voters little or no support, declared the Wahlberhörde the winner of the runoff election, this could cause problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, a low turnout was expected.
On Election Day, many Haitians have been hindered by lack of organization on the ballot.
Just before the start of some 250,000 cards, which are needed for election, were not yet dealt.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate government recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband was told Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez, a wave of sympathy that drove their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50% up. This is the highest figure since being elected in 2007.
Whether you this but the next year helping to re-election depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more accommodating than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who even after the election of his wife drew the economic policy, is often on budgets, tax revenues, economic growth and inflation has not fully taken into account.
This allowed the president and his wife, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit.
On paper, the Fernández government lost in the last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death on the 27th after a heart attack October led to further disagreements.
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronist rallied to Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (which struck another in the face of parliament and other government accused of corruption), it was the Congress not to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget does for the next year, which the President has even more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is overheating: it will probably grow this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate Coll at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of unions - the value to drive almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises said growth and poverty reduction to their primary objectives, and not the inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF harassed, the private sector and cleaned the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then the official inflation statistics, brightened.
Fernández can now follow a smoother path?
They called on the private sector and trade union leaders for talks.
And, according to official statements, wage increases are limited to 18% next year.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a big boost.
But the surge in growth, inflation, undermined by a large devaluation in 2002.
Maybe Cristina Fernandez wants financial terms for this reason, Argentina re-connect to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the Government signed an agreement with holders of securities that had earlier rejected the rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Fernández now seems to an agreement with donors from the Paris Club to push, which it owes about $ 6.7 billion.
The Kirchner had a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere, always refused.
But last month, announced the Minister Amado Boudou, the Fund will provide support to the creation of a new national consumer price index "technical support." It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is unknown whether Fernandez will be politically active after the end of its term without the support of her husband is.
If so, it needs to support the middle class, many of whom have had enough of Kirchnerism.
If the Argentines to return in March from their summer holiday, is the wave of sympathy that she was met, be abated.
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to many political decisions of her husband quietly canceled.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters slowly approach a closer connection to the mainland.
What Taiwan's view of his big brother across the strait?
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible voters, on to be elected to the five boroughs, mayors and town councils. This will provide a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou scored.
By building ground-breaking business, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with mainland China for the first time since 1949 lasting.
Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT), three of the five mayors is that they did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, given the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would have meant for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the share of votes his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time the DPP drew an even together with the KMT in the city councils.
During the election there were the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, Flag-waving mass parades and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election a speech to a KMT candidate,
him as a man in the crowd shot in the face. Lien was wounded and killed a bystander spectators.
Bizarrely, was not clear whether the shooter killed Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, affected the leader of the DPP, the election and brought the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans to housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence from China's military threat and refuse.
For this reason, the KMT government in its relations with Beijing, not like in the foreground.
But this time avoided the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings to stir up a lot.
She was responding to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China can not survive.
Ma would in turn confirm that the majority of Taiwanese favor of his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of Taiwan zurückzulocken with economic incentives in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration. But first things first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now re-invented.
Two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian for corruption was in prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he was strongly committed to absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working people and youth.
Tsai was a presidential candidate of the DPP very well received, as Su Tseng-chang to Chen.
Their party is doing everything now to show that they too will be able to develop strong relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussions.
Tsai said publicly that their party is a "trusted alternative" to offer Mas hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems to have this change very angry.
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatist Su even to abandon the presidential candidacy.
Even without the interference of Chen's DPP has difficulties to choose their candidates.
The KMT is undergoing its own self-analysis must.
Mas values ​​are bad, despite rapid economic growth, the KMT candidate wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity and unemployment seem more and more gaps between rich and poor to be.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will transform his Cabinet and the local bodies.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favor of rapprochement limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China seen as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no way back."

Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found after five hours of often heated public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project sought to promote terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement of the Commission on Wednesday evening, corresponding to the new religious center to local regulations and is an aesthetic eye catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Nael Hadi, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few enemies," he adds.
"They are very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the debate for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, the votes were distributed on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise fairly evenly.
The debate was conducted on the website of the newspaper on.
"There is no more America," was one comment.
"It's another planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have done in other parts of the country to protest, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.

Opponents can appeal the City Council still oppose the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of another species of bacteria that include can live on arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists of this unusual bacterium discovered here on Earth, it considers that it is a sign that a life without the hitherto possible as vital elements is considered.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it something special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form is," said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six major elements considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found the bacterium in California's Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders just what else is possible," the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar, said of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to realize life and its forms, Anbar.
The study deals with microbes that are found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details have been announced to the discovery gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet, that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements may share biochemical processes in motion and that the 'standard items', which we believe are absolutely essential for life, stipulated not as closely," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockels was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that it can be replaced in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically, it was thought that microbes, which both are exposed to potentially replace one element by another.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it is chemically similar to acts such as phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms difficult to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts other than phosphorus. It gets in our biochemical system, where almost everything is smeared," says Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium from GFAJ-1 increasing arsenic concentration. It is adapting and growing.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, the arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new. But so far there was no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so the science it is assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This is reason to believe that life may have also developed other than in the early era," says Forster, is not a member of Wolfe-Simon was a research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.

How Peek of The Times on Wednesday announced that should the other dogs in the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show take part in other competitions.
Southern California is a stop along the nearly month-long tour of the pair of dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, checked and Rickard a Peek at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of her bedroom window.
They took three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with in their motel room.
The thick-furred Akitas Corgis and remained in the van because it was cooler there.

The lion roars again following a court approval of the MGM-restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prime" from Gläuberplan to pay off the debt of $ 5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company to pave the way for new films and television shows.
According to the testimony of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy laws, so that the restart of MGM, led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglass Entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat stripped-down studio as General Manager.
The workforce will be reduced to more than 400 around 320th
For MGM enters Chapter 11 as recently as in force when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond issue of $ 500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
Right now heads a consortium of investment bank, which itself brings $ 75 million, the company. The financing should be done until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 to help with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, with the interest payments of $ 300 million fighting a year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, the CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who was his job at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts announced.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve the financial concerns MGM and pay out more than 140 Gläuber the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, both parties agreed in late 2009 to offer the company up for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the requested $ 2 billion by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch, as the MGM team began with the restructuring plan that was after months of internal debates and disputes in late October finally signed by the creditors.
If MGM has in the weeks to come through the bankruptcy official, Moelis and Cooper for their work in a bonus of several million dollars.
The proportion of Moelis & Co., which have already received $ 1.2 million, amounts to $ 9.5 million
Cooper, which was paid for the management of the company $ 375,000 per month will receive a "success bonus" of $ 4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM again. This year brought out the studio only a movie and created an annual plan with seven or eight films, the initial release in 2012.
They also are planning two movies after "The Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needed to a separate loan of $ 265 million to $ 275 million for its financial share of these two films to be established, directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM's loan sought a merger with the studio Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder is he.
But the last negotiations between the two companies led to no result.
Tech Toys Your Gift Budget holds in equilibrium
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a considerable hole in your budget gifts.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $ 99, while the price for a game about 10 Kinect classical skipping ropes, or about 48 cans Play-Doh meets.
But you can protect your gift budget.
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $ 80 three national toy retailer - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I was immediately clear that Moore's Law was in force. This year, the technology toys at the same time efficient and cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own web sites found on the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider range.
More and more button-cell powered toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise indicated, all prices of Toys "R" Us are.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13 for children 3 years) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs that sing a note, if you press on her stomach.
Press once corresponds to a note by pressing several times can you play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Note: If you started with the press of time, you can not stop.
For a combination of envoys and dance is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $ 60 for children 2) the best choice.
Based on the offers in the last year developed Elmo Live doll animatronic technology, the changing games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge legs with wheel lock, they dominated the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. Her parents complained, however, about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40 for children over 3), with a whole pile of question cards, with which a car can be a lesson, with a know-alls with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If your child does not want to entrust your phone like, here are three independent alternatives.
Mobigo from VTech ($ 60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. It or its games are not as instructive as those on the Explorer Leapster ($ 70 for children 3 to 12), which is equipped to the first major revision of the Leapfrog Leapster-series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions is compatible with older tapes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($ 90 for children 3 to 7) used for the Games and eBooks, a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive can also be considered family photos on it.
Finally, there are Scrabble Flash ($ 30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED display.
The game is about to merge the blocks to form words before time runs out. It is great for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more toys have some sort of online connection.
If you go alone to the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet on Club Penguin, you may also a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($ 5 for children 6 to 12) buy, which includes a coin with a confidential code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive the Club Penguin Store enough credits for two other parts.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle-stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell powered micro-robots, nano Hexbug ($ 10 for children over 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle is moving quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he is very durable.
We fell off the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are gentle
As a training officer walked Tang Shenbin on a city square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave it to military authority and subdued voice commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the City Planning feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence - to impress the audience.
"Just want!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "as girls are so pretty!"
grow out of four girls, barely a teen-age, stood at attention with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four ordinary hats sat perfectly with the blue and white striped hair kept grinding.
"To me they look average," said Mr. Tang disdain.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already sought to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants have a college degree.
Guangdong Province led the grayish green instead a bright blue uniform.
Wuhan in central China replaced by low-power staring: 2009 reportedly circled on 50 officials have not properly established food carts and stared at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 residents would like to change the perception fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women strengthen the municipal police patrols. They were selected because of their special appearance, good figure and its youth.
They should give the crude police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, it would hardly succeed and Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of this city commands.
By law, the critics.
Unlike the police officers may enforce these laws, the city only through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, beating officials in Hubei province, for an audience to death as this with his cell phone while she was filming, as they beat down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year was a training manual of the Beijing officials stolen and published on the web. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai dealer watermelon suffered after a scuffle with five officials of brain injury.
An exuberant violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China-trained officers in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan does the government fear," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics are the current approach clearly inadequate.
When examined in October by the Distrik display eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News put the question of whether the women had real jobs or are provided as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to job offer women were aged 18-22 with good looking figure and "harmonious facial features.
You should be larger than average - over 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the 26th Birthday.
According to officials, working for women over 25 is physically exhausting.
"The most important is their image," stated an unnamed district official at the quasi-governmental Rednet.com website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the Government of the District would like to disagree with this description,
but admitted that in China, not size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are unusual.
The same is true for even facial features.
Whether that equates with good appearance, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurement need not apply for.
"We can unfortunately not use the lame or hunchback," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image was not good."
Liu Yi, the patroliert Baoguang on the Square, next to a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She does not feel as sexist that so much emphasis on their appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic glance.
Her colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
They state that they regret the short shot, since they have ambitious career plans to herd than just dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to walk or bike as many rolls and tofu dishes to sell before they are sent packing.
"Mr. Wang, you are out of here please."
"We've said this so many times!" Ms. Xu said a dealer who had fled on foot and had left his bicycle mounted on a cart rolling kitchen temporarily down.
According to officials of the activity is more monotonous than tiresome.
"It's almost the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in the Arts distribution operations.
"Office Space."
One reason is that female officers may confiscate the goods of traders do not like their male counterparts.
You can only criminals threaten to report them to their male superiors.
They will protect public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents rioted from Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, after a rumor circulated, Chengguan officials have killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned and set on fire.
Xindu remained of such violent incidents so far been spared.
But riots are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet-Baonguang place where patroulierten the female officers that morning, about 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired contrary to the provisions on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed bloody murder.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials paved the way with a grim face to their vehicles and drove off with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of male patrol was left. He turned his white name tag in order to remain anonymous.
Like their fellow coordinators play - men over 40 - a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go to verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr Li said soberly.
"Most of the time people start with the argument."
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, which in his affair with a former election worker, and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying were brought against him, gave the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that caused a nationwide headlines, and put a damper on his career, he was regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced that he was on the sentence after the one-year investigation "delighted."
The ethics committee of the Senate could still impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to Ensign's lawyers they were from the Justice Department informed that the investigation against Senator Ensign have been set and that there is the matter no further charges.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The verdict was for many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents for the first time in October 2009, in The New York Times disclosed gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign workers, helped to lucrative contracts for his silence about an affair to buy with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked for a campaign treasurer as Ensigns.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after setting Hamptons lobbying.
Because Hampton was recently election team in Ensign, it was he could not lobby for a year take over for his former employer, or the entire Senate.
According to a statement of ethics experts violated the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, against the so-called revolving-door ban on Lobbykratie.
According to published evidence "is apparently an agreement and to the violation of the revolving-door statute" said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are targeted by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice official refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-known case, said Mr. Brand, and other ethics advocates, the ministry seems very cautious in taking political accusations against a large number of defeats by the media with great interest were pursued, including the decision to leave last year, the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct fall by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously frightened," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization aimed at fighting corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the U.S.) is a group of lawyers who has brought several charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
"That basically means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign said in an interview on Monday he had received a phone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, informing him that, was that the Ministry would not bring any action against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office again reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the Act.
Mr. Coggins declined to the legal arguments he had brought against the prosecutors to explain in more detail.
"I'm not comfortable in the call details between the Ministry of Justice and to walk me Suffice it to say. We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to discontinue the investigation for a separate action by the ethics group that had failed after a payment of $ 96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons of the federal election law.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, which has long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was a result of support from Mr. Ensign lobbyists work.
An e-mail in December 2008 shows that, after the company has done much to Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he Ministry of the Interior because of a cause "knocking."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers in Nevada, Allegiant Air, arranged to meet for lunch and asked the transport minister, held a meeting on behalf of the airline to agree, after this Mr. Hampton had set for the purpose of lobbying.
The last year for the first time about the affair to the public urged to apologize for Mr. Ensign to the electorate and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been standing in the ranking Republican in fourth place.
After many months was not noticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he is striving for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign to be the target of police investigations no longer, said his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped the Ethics Commission that follow very quickly the example of the Justice Department and hiring his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada to continue," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped into the riots off in the courtroom.
The minute they sent their reports on Twitter gruesome testimony.
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process to rape and child chained to beds in a house that burst into flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find a formal end when the verdict on the death sentence, which has pronounced the jury makes.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed claims with the court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts will be dealing for years.
One of the provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - and by the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - came to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details is so that the jury in inadmissible way by the public outcry had been affected.
Such opposition could lead the Courts of Appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in court is necessary.
"So as I have experienced during this process, I think it's really a risk if the intake influences of new technology in the courtroom of everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes lead counsel.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue Chamber of the Supreme Court last week dismissed the applications by decision succinctly back when he said, would be that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, appeals courts have determined that bear the coverage of notorious cases of doubt as to the fairness of a process can be.
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly murdered his wife lifted, and said in his ruling that due to the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the court would have given ."
Some people believe that based on the television series and the feature film "The Fugitive" in this crime.
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which Mr. Hayes condemnation consider a half-century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, at the time of the case, Dr. Sheppard was still inconceivable .
"It's a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes that are followed by the general public to be alarmed," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut . His report states that it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some Courts of Appeal could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of prompt communication from the courtroom out the processes could make fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many who claim the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years, and thus postpone a conviction.
The defense lawyers argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them during jury selection gruesome crime scene photos.
Some jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, had filled her with disgust.
The defense lawyers say they would make the constitutionality of the death penalty constitutional in question, and argue that the judge had incorrectly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to put the jury on the weekend off.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting of the process takes perhaps the greatest interest.
In one sentence challenge, which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and throughout the election campaign was discussed for the office of governor and for the American Senate candidate.
They argued that the new media have continuously ignited the flames of emotions about the case again.
"Such a rush of everyday media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "one has before that in New Haven, and perhaps not even the country experienced."
Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some said journalists that the claim that these direct messages were rabble-rousing than reports which are, slowly, an anti-technology view is that the impoverished on future reporting processes.
But some lawyers said, Courts of Appeal were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer Legal reinforce this assertion.
In their appeal they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, was repealed on the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of reporting and made it clear that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard against Maxwell represented the 21st century."
Politeness can connect the divide?
After a campaign of insults and negativity this week little civility in Washington is broken.
Is it the omen of a genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the struggle of parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and peaks of the Congress took a breakthrough in the major issues that might occur during the so-called "lame duck session," session at the end of a reign in which no decisions are taken more to employ, had.
After all that, what you hear, it was not a polite debate between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party gathering points.
The public meeting of the deficit of the President Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that exist between the members remain.
It seems clear that close interaction can occur over a period of months, a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that still separates the members of one another, veiled.
This is hardly enough to argue, there is a new era of cooperation had begun.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one of the other characters from the demands of cooperation and compromise, even while trying the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare to weigh.
Therefore, the meeting was limited on Tuesday itself and its evaluation by the participants for a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be expected that a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could.
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health and rights is, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election Washington, at least for a short time has become more tolerant.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which eventually die again.
And that's good. "
On some issues, particularly those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts that end of the year, and no one supports this
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise with respect to the increased unemployment benefits to be expected if only because the Republicans can not afford that one believes that deny favored tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers for assistance.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House has increased the optimism that one on these issues during the "lame duck session," while some may not ratify START and the new contract.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful collaboration lead in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to sustained cooperation of the parties must, when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-compliance is likely, perhaps inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that cooperation leads to true courtesy.
"I lot of what happens between now and 2012, see it as a front line, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters, whose education was appropriate.
How worried the Republican leaders may also be about having to play poker too high, they know that they have to try out its promise to reduce government spending and put the health reform repealed to comply.
This party lines in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission clearly deficit, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and increasing the retirement age and lowering government spending.
The Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson, and Erskine Bowles took over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so much urged to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission, 14 of 18 votes, to make its official recommendation, they plan to fight very come to even get near that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Panel, as in financial matters, at least today, is little room for compromise or little sympathy.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans to challenge Obama regards the national budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of major zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will cause this change?
Public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still wants more, that the two parties work together.
When confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to carefully pay attention to public reaction.
Whoever is destined to lose, will change course and seek compromises.
That may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be more ideological divide between Obama and the Congress as a Republican to be the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence of much broader choice 2012th
Seen like the courtesy that is worn on show this week to be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take on both sides a lot more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that separate the two remain apart.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money they collect, on to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the state security police extort protection money high so they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only by legitimate businesses, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes his share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo that was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was released on Tuesday from his home page on WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow was still Mayor, and he was accused of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which has a known construction company, have refused for years to allegations of corruption over again, and he has won numerous libel suits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was asked about a documentary that suggests that he is corrupt ." It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty"
An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The polls have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of, that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow City Government with the crime has meant that some of them as" call and come to the conclusion that the government is acting more like a kleptocrats as a government "interference, so the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy an" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals about the Mafia, which literally means roof or protection), which extends over the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Service Authority (MVD) and the Office the prosecutor as well as extending throughout the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is our top priority."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
Recent follow the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level. "
"This is an incompetent system, close to the criminal groups in some areas, a gap because the city is offering no help."
The report further says that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and the police arrested the small business.
A source is, then, "said that to understand Moscow's business owners that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not by organized crime), because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law. "
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is not as popular as before."
The memo noted that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, protecting themselves are not very modest, even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other pretext.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about fighting corruption, but noted also that he has made little progress.
The message of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were probably full of money, go to the Kremlin.
"Leave in its fight against corruption must Medvedev on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, said Director of By, a Moscow committee of experts in a recent interview.
"But he is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class as a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, according to estimates, by which Russia Corruption costs more than $ 300 billion per year.
The country ranked 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparence International (countries from least corrupt "lists" most corrupt "to).
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, ​​which happened after Moscow time late at night, will almost certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, though, as Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can be to the Kremlin a chance to say that to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin argued that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have been called Batman and Robin Medvedev.
"The truth is that it goes to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect that this was done with such arrogance with such pressure and in such unethical manner, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced a confrontation with the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with peeling walls and dirty, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Cor Sreng Ma, 42 years.
known for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge's reign as "the butcher," is the commander popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still living .
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-term followers will be challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum that victims are allowed public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook, the first former child soldier tells the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July a joint tribunal condemned the UN and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek IEV, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
Each of these developments, the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Veng, their efforts made it difficult for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There is still resentment and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do something," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even splits families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979, the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998 when the last movement surrendered to sleep.
As introduced Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary, the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok went the next generation matured in Anlong Veng.
But the mid-1990s, when a project funded by the UN peace agreement led in 1993 the first democratic elections in the country, started a large group of Khmer Rouge fighters, to the government to overflow, leading to the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998 led.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who was not given, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in prison in Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
As their patron they are no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if kept a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, were the rank and poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have very little benefit from the surrender," Sok Leang said the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds throughout Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are rooted in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined in 1974 as a teenager the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle to Anlanger Veng, before he settled in 1998 to lead a life of a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has been eating something for everyone."
"But now, life is hard because we have to take care of themselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also aroused concern.
Early next year, the court will try to provide Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister in court.
The order of the court is to order the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases, further action.
That has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, concentrated, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was the district chief in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told agents of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, they have guided the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of slave laborers died probably.
On a hot evening in Chaem came from work in the fields of her wooden house in a dirty back road out of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass threw leaned in Chaem discuss it off to charge, their past, the Khmer Rouge.
If they summon the court, they would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia is at peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more prosecutions would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be unsafe, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to go to forward to, "said Youk Chhang by the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-time means of collecting the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together, so as to understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history books for the High School Ministry of Education that contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How many times in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know very little about the Khmer Rouge regime, despite the compounds of the city.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook will help students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family does not accept many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance is complex and complicated the process of reconciliation, "said Sok Leang.
But obtaining the public forums, the textbook and the court gradually influence, "he said.
Still has the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction.
Up in the mountains Dangrek launches of shrubs and overgrown with plastic garbage dirty way to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was cremated here after his death in 1998 at a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile vendor on the roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated here.
"But he has a strong mind and many people go here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will take a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect more weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear material security, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus expects to earn no more highly enriched uranium and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus, to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian Research Institute.
That set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the main results of Obama's "Nuclear safety summit of 47 nations to be" in April, had been ruled out of Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next peak 2012th
"I was really impressed by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Safety Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all nuclear material precarious.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries, their highly enriched uranium to get rid of.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries were doing it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of pounds, which is essential weapons-grade and less-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... We will make it no dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes only, that's all."
Belarus approached yet in a few months ago the United States, as it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated because the material was contaminated slightly, say officials.
It was loaded onto a special train, the more than 1300 miles to say a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was conducted according to the officials by plane.
The U.S. government pays for this $ 14 million effort, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium flows, which can not be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," which led to the agreement that was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official with the Ministry of Energy, which operates on the global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium and hundreds of pounds waffenfähhigen of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants according to the joint agreement to resolve his camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko harsh abuse of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcome hot end, announced the United States of America and Belarus that an increased respect remains for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens, "she explains.
No objections to the Spanish government for CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo on Spanish territory, as stated in a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
The mirror of the Wikileaks Sibel and to the daily newspaper "El País" resist (by cable) routed documents. It is added that the former deputy prime minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega urged the Spanish government should be informed, "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over to Spain, to be adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report from € Europe, where state aid to human rights-defying practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was accused in discussing the former ambassador Eduardo Aguirre North American and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister admitted that the report of the Council "Zapatero has met on the sidelines" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega emphasized that Spain had no objection to the secret flights via Spanish territory."
"They want to just be informed" in order "to be surprised unprepared" not, Aguirre reported by cable.
Also, the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed, the Ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "would give the matter no attention, although the government had little influence, as they lay in the hands of the judge."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez gave his hand in January 2007 to understand the message that he would not to apply for judicial initiative that declassification of documents of the Spanish National Intelligence (CNI) and the Defence Minister on the CIA flights block.
"These reports do not contain any harmful or sensitive information," the ambassador said after talks with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish State Prosecutor and the German prosecutors," concerned as to the declassified information to the CRF and the Ministry of Defence.
"This will further complicate coordination between independent observers for discrete handling our efforts between governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, said the latter, that "although the Spanish judges are considered insane heavily on their independence and would do what they think is appropriate," he given its employees instructions had "inflated rhetorical comments to avoid to make abate the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern over the actions of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance teaches our experience to us that the PP would not doubt have a hint that the government, Zapatero U.S. actions that could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations be tolerated or ignored deliberately, capitalize, is even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government, "he emphasizes.
The child killer confesses that she had complained on the internet about the "hardships" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child, as this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror on Galician Art"
Mónica Fernández Juanatey the Internet "Muki."
In this nickname, which she runs from a young age, she has a cousin and a friend at least contact. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The messages are from the year 2008.
To understand this, one must know her love life, which reconstructs the daily ABC on the basis of testimony of their families.
The 30-year-old Galician Women adopted in 1998 a relationship with Iván Túñez, to an industrialist.
She held one year.
Shortly after they had dissolved their relationship became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly after, she went a different relationship.
Alberto was the chosen one, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
With him she lived a long time together.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands, to look in the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who accompanied her even a week to Palma.
But from the content of their messages can be concluded that their love affair broke, and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sour, because I came here to work."
"When I told him, he found it good but now he realizes, of course, what it means to the boys all day long to be alone and not to be free, and can let them do what they want."
Later, she mentions a message that she had just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month, or send me an address to which I can can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he does not like the fact that I let the boy with my mother, I take it off when I get back."
In May, she speaks of returning to their village: "This week I'm going to be there, but I'll just stay there until the 19th, because I imagine myself on 20 to a work do if I lose the will."
She explains that she takes her first-born, if all goes well.

Popular Party won four seats in Congress to PSC and lost 9
With the results of 28 November could play the PP in the cities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona a crucial role
After the major cast members and growth in the recent local elections the PP directed her eyes already on the parliamentary elections - anticipated or not. Their expectations are more positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved this in this election, is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus the Catalan Popular Party won 610 473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this number in the regional elections in 2006 only amounted to 316 222.
On the last Sunday scored the PPC 384 091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of diversion of the voting shares of PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should continue, predict the analysts of the PP, that could rise in the parliamentary elections, the PPC of 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (she has now 10 to win) and lose the PSC at least 9 members (of 25) would.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the Popular Party, the ERC would lose one representative - currently she has three - while ICV could keep their members or to win.
If the election calendar are maintained, the next date coincides with the local elections in May 2011. Even then, the Popular Party (PP) may be the tongue of the scale in order to put the socialist hegemony to an end, and in fact, four provincial capitals and with the majority on the city council of Barcelona, ​​one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011 .
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC can access the cities of Barcelona, ​​Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona in which the Socialists with a majority either to achieve even its traditional allies (ERC and ICV) will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that the party lost its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, ​​in which they would achieve 5% of the vote is.
The PP, however recorded an increase in their voting participation in the four provincial capitals and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, ​​Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that we can play the main role in Tarragona change. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lleida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign met them several times.
In other important places, such as in Badalona, ​​Castelldefels or Reus The People's Party observed a significant increase.
Currently, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and seeks the creation of lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan worried al Qaeda cell thousands of passports
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona, ​​there were three more in Thailand
Which formed seven by the police from the intelligence agency of the police in Barcelona arrested Pakistanis and Nigerians from Thailand controlled jihadist cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Lashkar e-Taiba " (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Mumbai that claimed 106 dead in 2008 - provided them with passports.
The Spanish interior minister has a great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he says, "Operation Kampai" is the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaeda's "weakened" the world has been and thus their ability to act. "
The researchers believe that were sent in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports to Thailand, where these and then forged to the groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy composed, were sent in excess so that their "fighters" with impunity, the European borders and other Western countries have.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, apart from the Thai research institutions and other European police forces have been involved in the investigation. It is possible that it will come on the territory of the EU in the coming days to similar attacks like the one that was executed last Tuesday in Barcelona.
(Arrested the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabrane Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) In coordination with this operation was carried out in Thailand another, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had the run of Bangkok in Spain and other European countries established cell.
The Catalan Network - a part of it was made in 2009 destroyed - steel in particular tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the "International Islamic Front.
This means that the documents are issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and still had several years to be valid, they were allowed to have any visa stamps.
In study circles, underlines that until now no correlations between the detected in Bombay in Catalonia arrested and the attack could, although the author of this attack, Lashkar e-Taiba, "was one of the recipient groups in Spain stolen and then forged in Thailand passports.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that some days had been shipped before the assassination of Catalonia by means of a money transfer company several thousand dollars were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which is adopted by the members of the "Commands "were that caused the lives of 106 persons to an end use.
The police seized a large library.
PP calls from Mas postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho took the opportunity yesterday, Artur Mas personally present their conditions for support of his taking office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from the sum during the election campaign made and can be personalized with the primacy of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a revenue sharing agreement that will propose to the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan people's party turned to the safety of Artur Mas, which gave it the 18 parliamentarians who had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU rely on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he came to the vote.
Future alliances which would like the regionalists in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress, depend on a possible entente from the PP. The talks, the mass at the time with the other party leaders will turn, however, to Catalonia.
As for the leader of the PPC, they shall request that in order to support the inauguration "all discourses that affect the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia," and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, will stand back.
Both political leaders do have in common is that they make the convoluted political apparatus of the regional administration more slender and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations took office Mas deal on the part of PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced the opposition a hard - and Joan Herrera (ICV) basis. Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The nursing home confirmed that the deaths were not caused by "lack of action"
The owners of the center in Olot do not rule out that her nurse killed eleven elderly
The leaders of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) announced yesterday a press conference in which it turned out, the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmen - the nurse who had killed during his work at least eleven elderly, for which he was responsible - was added to the device.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, entered, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat would prosecute those responsible (for deaths)," but "the right and our liability to force us to the process and civil liability "to accept.
The device must accept not only a loss of prestige in society, because it's criminal actions of the nurse had not found in time, but now paying a high amount of compensation that is used by the legal representatives of the families of the victims charged.
Joan Vila Dilmen admitted that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he had killed since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - at, since he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased person, but the formalities due to their age and illness were conducted by telephone.
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point and stated that "lack of action could be keinerzeit been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "would in the case of no evidence for negligent actions of another person as the accused."
The already confessed as "Angel of Death" baptized the day before eleven deaths and said that the first crime, 29 August 2009 and have committed a half months later, murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said, the access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
Insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail was one of the nurses in six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patient with the death of their suffering.
But highlighting the results of laboratory investigations will Vila lies and for his first victim actually chose a less cruel death, or whether or not this from inside burned by them bleach administered, as he had done, according to confessions of three women he between 12 and 17 October murdered.
In La Caritat gives you the testimony of the keeper no faith, not even as regards the number of seasoned murder, which could well be more. This setting is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it made no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they stood on that basis and to clarify the scope of these incidents the judiciary available.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond."
The spreads of euro Peripheriländer have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should be allowed, that the ECB may be deceived and fed, the euro has hardly points to what causes for concern, do not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovered to the extent in which he breaks down again, but due to the closure of short positions and highly speculative.
The institutional investors are still not lose his fear.
A month ago today urged the European Central Bank on us to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen reversed, that the ECB must be tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably make quite a few times in the future, backed down.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to purchase government debt, as these were ineffective, and the removal of all temporary extraordinary liquidity measures. It should only be a one-week unlimited access will be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March," and extended the quarterly awards shall be maintained with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the program continued to purchase of bonds and a strengthening signal is output.
If the established expectations are not met, the excellent response by the markets yesterday reflected again and if halstarrig insists is that we take back our liquidity measures can only help us God!
As with the ECB meeting in May in which reaffirmed the bank, the purchase of debt securities not to be considered and the markets collapsed, then, could be repeated this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said to have bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the annual auction of government securities in Portugal was rather weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million of 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, mirroring a perception change in the markets reflected in the words Trichet.
In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole by Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated to be 10 000 million short-term and possible further estimated 15 000. It is time to February, to raise private capital or those banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had recognized the problem with the stress test in July, the numbers under the rescue plan, acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government on Tuesday received parliamentary approval for his new budget. Since it has still not have the proper support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has her discourse in regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December designed moderate. There, political unity is needed to show that we play together the same score.
The problem is that Germany will play Wagner and the other countries of the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday before the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the national deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation programs. Actions that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared with February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain was swift and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise.
Today it is a major draw a three-year government bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect is. Therefore, we rely on strong demand, which will eliminate any doubt about our ability to reschedule.
For Spain would be requesting a relief plan, a self-sacrifice.
We would receive cash which we do not need. The Treasury has made available 40 billion euros, three times more than in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy in accordance with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only being, but also the appearance."
Take heart, we can!

Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars will be improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull in 2004 invaded the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine world of speed of surprises and successes, is marked.
At first no one gave attention to the newcomer, and despite its steep rising career during the past few seasons set last November at the final sprint to win all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
reduce Without the capabilities of the German pilot and World champion Sebastien Vettel, or the performance of the engine from Renault to do is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull put in his hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company in 2007 for purposes that have nothing to do with car racing, brought to market.
This called PLM computer science program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements that are observed on the race and the tests can design and execute.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 worked in the racing teams, an average of ten technicians who were able to introduce in a season at most three or four improvements.
In Red Bulls team today 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer systems analysis, and they do all sorts of changes to the cars through.
The Siemens manager, said that the PLM software is able to analyze all components of the cars of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine, the Renault explained solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes due to advanced manufacturing and high-tech autoclaves in less than 24 hours of television in the reality of the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is set, the 40 million dollars, a Formula 1 - may issue for his race team in a season.
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its cars in a remote location 50 kilometers from London.
There are two buildings that out - are very limited - especially from journalists.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - Held without a doubt is the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, which makes the energy drink manufacturer in the service of his participation on the race tracks, hide other protagonists, whose invaluable support and their reputation is zero.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey stressed that it was five years ago could still say that the progress in R & D for race cars, 50 percent contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values ​​have changed. The technology makes 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilot is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are not predictable gladiators.
HP will open in two years, twenty specific shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona for his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ronte Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty transactions, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which it plans to open multi over the next two years in Spain.
The company agreed this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as an example the converted shop on the Gran Via in Barcelona, ​​the property of Pont Reyes, together with the HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to 2010 in Europe to set up 200 outlets, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not reveal the new stores coming, but did not from that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice chairman, who is also director of HP Personal Systems assured that philosophy to shop opening was always the same. It relies on local distributors with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with hands-on interactive products). In Europe all the stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of shop personnel.
Helena Herrero said it not a franchise system and stressed that the purpose of the exclusive network of sales outlets will, "the customer service and advice to small and micro enterprises in purchasing and then to optimize and even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has been a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP machines with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical center in Maastricht (Holland) on.
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two weeks."
"This system was especially developed for small and micro enterprises and private users, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical support," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' his rivals in three years, a million customers
The Executive Board Member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis, and predicted the end of the war debt.
Nevertheless, he predicts a fall in interest margins, the banks try to offset the increases in fees and rates for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years, a million retail customers - even to an existing subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and so to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will introduce new Dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The goal is to not only survive, without taking the public funds from the FROB claim, but also the market share of around one million residential customers - 700 000 if you subtract the customers who will lose the bank - to zoom. This is the great challenge facing the bank is, because until now she has devoted more attention to its business customers as their retail customers.
This year it has added 000 private customers will receive 250 and 50 000 enterprises.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, meaning austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank that is, they think along with annual report.
Only a few banks to venture into these difficult times, set targets and publish, as the world financial crisis, all plans of the banks are confused.
Sabadell will complete this year its master plan set out four years ago, Optima. This was initially for three years, but due to the market situation, he was extended for one year.
The customers who are leaving are the savings banks, the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by Apie said Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "long range."
The manager believes Spain could only "slowly" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - crucial to the survival of banks.
Although it assumes that war to liabilities - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks for their emissions to obtain pay by cash, as passed to compensate for shrinking profit margins on already, the price for loans - the interest rate margins punished .
"The issues of capital and financing of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We do not have the tap turned off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto was already on Thursday from the arrangement of its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differentials (see, Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently Stategie, "the fee increase," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, excludes non-corporate businesses.
Not for nothing, he assured that in Spain, "larger firms are necessary."
"Next year will change everything," he says.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormous increase" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slide into the red.
He believes the FROB Kaptitalaufstockungen could replace the money market.
After being assured that Sabadell could survive even a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers who already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out "you get nothing in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, could be achieved short-term financing through repurchase agreements, and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that there might be a wave of mergers of savings banks, and emphasized the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
Sometimes in the process of consolidation of the Spanish savings banks, savings banks were more out in the first phase not to participate. They retained the right to the second round.
Other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish Association of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio would not take place Olavarrieta, this second round.
"I think the biggest part of the merger is completed. Cajasol The inclusion of the group Banca Civic can not be regarded as the second round, rather it is negotiated adjustments."
"The biggest part is completed. It may be that we have instead of siebzehen thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. They were from Banco de España, which supports all operations strongly controlled."
In one of the Association of Managing Director and Manager of Aragon (ADEA) organized breakfast resulted from Olavarrieta that the concentration process was "carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely flow that in the past, not now, under the business plans with Banco de España has been set, "he said.
"The transition of 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million asset base to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have complied with the Basel Accords" he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there will be a series unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, for "Banco de España exhorts us to the timely completion of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain is one of the most rigorous financial systems of Europe and "perhaps" was all over the world and added that those who anzweifeltenn that this "without extensive knowledge" would do.
The manager noticed that we have to make in the current economic climate, "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" process of concentration that would be implemented "as quickly as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks, the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July, had passed very well.
Zapatero and the red line in Germany
Berlin has decided to include retention of the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union.
The tension in the markets have caused a duplicate response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, presented new adaptation measures, from tax breaks for small and micro enterprises, regulation of employment agencies and cancellation of 426 Euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent from AENA, the administration Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, has with the help of former President Felipe González government criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as managers who herausbeschwört the current crisis.
As these processes are understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
While Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective, a to shaping our future, the conflict with the maintenance of ancient traditions of much of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe starting in Germany to speculate about three possible ways out of crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would leave the euro area.
The Second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although currently it sounds more like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The Third: A transformation of the euro according to the German proposals. That means more macroeconomic control, strict financial management; punish countries that violate the regulations; möglichereweise the payments of some countries and the expansion of the potential costs of adaptation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and is emerging for some time. Therefore, there are now no excuses.
First, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provides incentives for deficits and the German government, a constitutional reform took off the sleeve, to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the growing gap between what Germany thought it necessary (strict control plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the central European country, as Merkel's decision to rescue Greece painful postponed.
At that time, which was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion was totally opposed to rescue Greece.
Finally, Merkel is in the last days of October and again with a clear position of strength. She calls for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country and at the same time to require private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they advanced the Ireland crisis and all that follows.
But her proposal, although some sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union that will allow these measures as of 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not pass.
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken now - there will be from that date the old no longer functioning of the euro.
2013 the year of birth will be a new currency area in which the offending countries will face severe penalties, may be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and take in this case, the private sector a portion of these costs.
Germany have shown us is that we are a hard growth, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improve productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and building industry with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, is simply not acceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly in not understanding it.
It's not just about the national deficit by 2013 to drive down to three percent.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, we are deceiving themselves.
I hope the current turmoil to go to more peace.
And that we have the opportunities that we are commanded to use until the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and its double announcement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the Enterprise on Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesized order to create in-house, their way has prepared.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look that situation would change somewhat.
Among the options under consideration is that we are serious with the little stuffed euro zone countries would have to leave to exclude.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and control circumvention
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax shows ingenuity, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The supposedly by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso, Sergio Ramos) instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled over whether it is an unsportsmanlike act or not act, and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had already won clearly) the time and played several fouls, so the referee showed them the second yellow card.
would in this way, and give the Real Madrid since his group, the two players to the penalty prescribed for the next league game against Auxerre meet and so on without a card game to the next phase.
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee UEFA punished the club coach, Jose Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
She is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport rules followed - is.
Part of the arisen debate about the case shown stems from the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (who claims in his hymn nobility and honor, and punished on other occasions his players of similar incidents had) it played the leading role, and the dramatization Mourinho, who has added one more episode to its long history as a theatrical technician and provocative.
In any case, turns the debate about whether this is not expressly prohibited by the statutes of conduct contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention rule. Actually endorses this on the statutes of the sport, but seem to get around its meaning.
In the matter of the spirit of sport should be investigated damage caused.
The spirit to defend the physical integrity of the adversary, an aspect that has not been jeopardized by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that pull the offending player an unfair advantage of the opposite team. That did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand about foul play or rule evasion, for the circumvention of the rule was implemented not in secret to avoid a penalty, but they should be as flashy as possible so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sentence to joy.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls subject.
Here should be emphasized that the rival was neither placed in a less favorable situation has advantages for the game played were demanded, for the obvious result of this move was that your team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club does not then these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without playing cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertainty advantage because the team could leave at some point. In addition, the players with this approach, a penalty and go into the second cycle of cards in which they retire because of accumulation of cards with a card lower than the first cycle.
Thus, it is not so clear whether there really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the spirit of sport, to which strategic decisions in order to benefit from the provisions of the possible results.
In this case, the players wanted to avoid any penalty (which would actually be a clear case of circumvention rule), they would rather choose when to undergo this.
They made a strategic decision to avoid a penalty or not to flee from her.
Although the line between ingenuity and control environment is blurred, I think that it is this issue a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because there are two self-exclusion was due to the nature of the unprovoked and control transmission.
The damage that the principles of sport has caused these acts, is less ethical than aesthetic rather Articles
Offensive to offer customers fishing for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year makes a flood of bookings on days 16 and 17 Fall in December.
The celebration paid by employees themselves are spreading. You do not spend more than 20 to 30 €.
As the nougat and the Christmas lottery is available in the run-again group dinners, which supply the catering and Leisure industries Barcelona oxygen. But due to the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to even the customer segment that represents the great mass of capturing: Almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner to acknowledge the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
This accounting is a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) all orders in the week of 13 December drop, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations at two peak day (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set the group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To preserve this tradition do not have to pay many of these workers from their own pocket.
How is the economy However, it required low prices, confirmed the Chairman of the Board of Barcelona Restaurant, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization dares not yet predict how the holidays will look this month.

"They want to go out much, but they pay heavily on prices," he stressed.
The business will go where good, "offering quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save money in times of crisis, which is why prices are demanded by 25 € strongest.
In a survey conducted in various central Restaurants turns out that the evening of the 17th December providers leads to collapse.
The group Soteras says the demand for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 € would be booming. The group has adapted its menu to complete offers 25-35 € to the economic situation.
In another leading group Andilana, the 16 restaurants has in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the peculiarity of the calendar to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.

Sources of the group point out that the 18 an overactive day with groups of friends, the Christmas pre-celebration, will be.
The six group menus was a Christmas menu for 30 € or more added as Price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing, 10 percent more than last year to spend, and in turn want more details, such as Cava.
Even in some companies see green shoots sprouting, so the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back on the upswing.
The part of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with bodies like the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona) trust, the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà to see out the end of the tunnel and noticed that the reservations are generally quite "lively" even though the "Knock out the maximum" customers.
The fun party was not, however, declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program aroused great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad nuclear weapons is "faster than any other country in her."
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The revealing of the Internet site Wikileaks content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department confirmed that prepares huge concern, the Pakistani nuclear program, Washington.
On the edge of the clarification and juicy details that provide the documents relating to the content of the discussions and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that that cooperation is not strengthened between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety, but on the contrary "decreases" and that the Asian country more unstable atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country" produces.
In particular, the nature of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored in order to discourage a possible attack their destruction - Washington put sleepless nights.
The risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, to: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to be attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material. "
The large number of people who are implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs, not just from the U.S., but also on the increase, and Russia as a reason to be careful considered.
"Pakistan must devout personnel to guard the nuclear facilities set, due to the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organizations reklutieren more options people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," the expert Yuri Korolev said of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with its North American counterpart.
New to the Internet portal unveiled by Julian Assange documentation is that the cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan decreases in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased tempo, in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, ​​the communication with Pakistan describes as "frustrating," says: "Often there is no transparency on offers of assistance we received no replies or they are rejected."
In another announcement confirms Peter Lavoye, an official of the local secret for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as any other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by a top military leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, "clarify" the manager that "Pakistan army's tacit support: added set of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior person responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track and locate Assange.
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forming a complicated labyrinth, allowing it to clear up the facts is difficult.
Interpol yesterday gave a "red alert" from the "tracking and tracing" of Assange.
However, these are not a traditional arrangement of the arrest.
It is also not new, it dates from 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the final revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the U.S., but rather with the sexual abuse allegations, which the Australians were raised in Sweden.
Also assured the attorney for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange record."
On 20 were from the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden, the arrangement, but it was not until yesterday after receiving the powers by the Swedish authorities announced.
It appears that the things. Interpol's 188 member states need to identify and locate Assange, "to suspend him to arrest and surrender."
Although Interpol not be arranged the arrest of a hit by a red alert individual can, many member countries consider, according to the organization of the red alert as a license for a Arrestierung - carried out by the national police must - in particular, have if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange person's probable.
The action outraged Assange lawyers released yesterday a letter in which she informed you that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer questions via video conference, the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested departure from Sweden and from the prosecutor, with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief, is compared, the authorization was given.
"It's like a fighter, not as a prosecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia protested the innocence of her son - has Assange to an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he was the director of Time magazine on Skype from an unspecified place in an interview. In the interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats of spying on the UN and thus to international agreements signed by the United States has failed should withdraw them," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should attach importance to the views of a type with a website," he told the CNN.
Obama himself has engaged a high charge of the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents reveal.
The attempt by the speaker of the presidents, Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention is to announce, in contrast to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in those days.
Congressman Peter King, who will lead from January to chair the National Sicherheitskommitee the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks to add to the list of terrorist organizations, "to impound the money and anyone who supports or contributes to pursue. "
Tom Flanagan, Advisor to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had his statement, Assange must be "murdered" revoked.
"Obama would turn him into a target and not use a manned aircraft or something."
Who does not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Who ever was the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and all that is no execution, is too mild a punishment egg con," he told the Fox.
Puigcercós examined with a nod to the Carod loved ones peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on its continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and before the end of the assembly principle.
Puigcercós Joan seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time of internal turmoil within the ranks of directionless after the loss of 11 Deputies and half the votes ERC to go out of their way.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not the loved ones of the former party leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira is sufficient. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor themselves and not bring him the same headaches, as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tried with a wink, the new critic to win, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, announced yesterday that over 200 local council members could comment ERC secret about his remaining in office.
With ballots, not a superior hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Presidential those getting a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the boss wants both the impression of division as well as avoid the submission of his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentage values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
Carod the Allies demand that the President more than just the party to make his office available. Insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controlled the governing body of the Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority for promotion of resignations, they will agree with the Board a plan of action from now until May.
But they expect in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the line on 18 referred to the Council on the vote is to be able to participate.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, these promise to bring forward the Congress in the fall of 2011, which keeps the party leadership is already a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that "Polyphony" is detrimental to the stability and he seeks once and for all time to bring the organization in a position to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the item that the incumbent Consellers Josep Huguet wrote in his blog, symptomatic.
Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, was the owner of Innováció it for a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for a number of goals."
He counted five, of which there are two in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the Board so that it takes at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests ERC should give up the General Assembly as a principle operation at last.
He championed a reform of the statutes that would allow it to hold the meetings with elected delegates.
By the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team that struggled on their last two meetings for obsessed.
In fact, was commissioned on the quaking Assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the assembly principle to a conference that would deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending because of internal infogle resting of the last years, the addressing of this matter was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors lie in wait, could be the time came to reopen the matter and complete forever.

Obama sits in a Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you for the adoption of the Dream Act - the law are, to then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twittered the President of the United States in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - legislation to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you for the adoption of the Dream Act - the law are, to then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," tweeted Obama.
His message contains a cyber link to a larger document that asks the public to unterzüglich connect with their senators in contact since the vote of the law was imminent.
"With your voice, in which we wait, the time has come for you to listen," he says.
The message was circulated after the 42 Republican senators threatening to block any vote for any law would be extended unless the extension of tax breaks from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a signed letter by the 42 Republican senators, could include coordination of the Dream Act - the law and affect other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the law Dream Act and other projects, said the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he was confident that, once the tax issue had been resolved, a schedule for the remaining projects could be established.
"I think we have plenty of time ..."
"We all agree that the tax issue be settled before the year has to ..."
"I think we also can always make an agreement and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid announced on Tuesday, "he would vote to close debate 'request so that the Dream Act - Act, which coordinated the initiative to legalize undocumented students from next Thursday in the Senate could be, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American dream would be about 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen yet, during the last five years have lived in this country and in a higher educational institution, or enrolled in the army are legalized.
But the proponents of the law require the adoption of the initiative sixty votes, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project organized an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of which support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, said one of them, agree with the Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, he was against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced its support of the law.
Therefore, the Defender of the Dream Act more Republicans get to their side, if other Democrats should choose to turn away from the initiative back.
Among the most sought-after Republican from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past, are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained it to no longer support on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the bill, John McCain has set out its position yet.
Although the House has a different version, agree analysts agree that is the Dream Act in the Senate against the largest obstacles.
With the lay literature finger into the wound
The second round of 'The love of language' was a walk in which the participants made a strong commitment to narrative
"That the sex in the language I understand, yes, but ... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, which was to open the second round of 'Los de la lengua placeres' , a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of your question (on another event was the round table devoted to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound ... "Brings us in trouble," the Argentine Schriftstellein spat sweet at the audience, which is composed mainly of young people at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) came together to attend this hosted by Marisol Shultz round table where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text which they devoted Gonzalo Celorio, and Shultz then marked as a great story. Luisa told in first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what is a "wound," and go from doctor to doctor, from which it receives but does not answer, but notes for the guidance of her story.
It leaves the Infektologen convinced that "patience is not my forte, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma surgeon who robbed her in the middle of the hallway the breath, and she has stated that wound was not a scientific term, enthült the psychoanalyst the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar. "
The protagonist of the story makes sighs and closes, she "learned only from the wound, that this was really open and not exist." But she is convinced that the love of language and their cases are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez presented a delightful story, which he called 'In praise of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, well-traveled men brought back or restored from a girl lost virtue. The story made a U-turn and talked about America, the great novel, which was lacking from the outset not to his own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the illustrated true stories, but otherwise the history of America had never been told -. With imagination, which was even lost the sense of shame"
However, he stressed, "there are the crazies and liars who imagine things best," and then to approach reality and lie to each other where we do not know which side is part of the story, where the fictional literature Summit reached.
He calls the fact the 'tradition of Cervantes.
"From him we have inherited, to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was your turn, commented and praised the writer, the diversity of interpretations, which had contributed to the invitation of the filter to the Round Table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman to dedicate her review of the great wound of the social violence that affects their country - as the whole of Latin America - as a result of battles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after she had pointed out that literature is communication and commitment, which is between the author and the readers as a " build chemical reaction. "
The evening decided the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution is also "engaged writer of this finger in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in addition to run a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness on dogmatism, and forgotten, "that behind every confirmation and a small no and stands behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: And shading often meant to put the finger into the wound and harass those who feel more comfortable, when in the form of cartoons in black and white to think in prefabricated ideas without nuances, harass and even the powerful who prefer to divide the world in black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of a letter.

The tables santi strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ," as del Morelia had the reins in his hand, which he learned from Toluca 4-2 with a great defeat, and later, at the' Clausura 2003 ', he reached the decisive duel, which he lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Even with Santos Laguna in the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, plug Rubén had another setback as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros draw after 210 minutes of play went out, but the penalty he came with 3 -1 forward and insert had two opportunities to its title, but ultimately missed three of his players, the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. He therefore asked not to be pursued again by the calamity and free themselves from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he reiterated that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I want to break any statistics, as for a club of my affection, should surrender myself, and so the title will come to me, but what happened before, is the most important thing," said the mate, when he was asked about the lost finals.
The last final is it still remained strong in mind, he says, have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee whistles not the end, we can not celebrate, we at the line are prepared, the players also because the last time we were with two penalty saves even prepared to resign, and I think that this is a lesson, not until the game ended, there is no cause for celebration. "
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty kicks, it does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shootout, we want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and we must be prepared to , in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately gave us the fate of a poor game to keep sometimes due to nervousness or violent effort, the title already in the hands, the left us somewhat for this final, and we hope that this time it will not happen. "
It is Romanso power to be not only the second champion for the first time to taste the glory, bring the title with him.

The clandestine immigration could be traced easily
The bill the conservatives, who purport to govern according to the Government the issue of ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday announced that it can not support the proposal.
"I lean strongly against the charter."
"I think with a party that has you put shackles on his feet," said Michael Ignatieff, the Liberal leader, after the weekly caucus meeting before the assembled delegates.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any one than to transport illegal immigrants identified ship next person to hold up to a year, hurt as proposed by the Canadian legal and constitutional freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois hinted at as to support the draft law can not apply because it is against the wrong target group.

We support the draft law of the Conservatives, therefore, not because he seeks to blame the refugees and children at least a year, held captive, "said Chow.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play politics and ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians share with the members strongly that they tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, do not these criminal operations that relate to Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"You expect that Canada will take tough measures," the reaction Minister Kenney.
"The government has no vote of confidence with respect to announced their bill, which would lead the country to elections, which were rejected by the government.
A conservative, however, has raised with the Agency QMI, the government would convene a vote, so that each opposing deputies immediately explain to its voters.
The new unit will not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible formation of a new unit available to the fight against corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claims that this idea did not originate from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation for advice on this topic.
The city has since 1870, standing on a unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday more than one surprised.
You have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec police force on 29 was not October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils discussed at all.
There was no "deal at a table tinkered end solution" also no doubt that Stéphane Bergeron critic, and member of the Parti Québécois, the announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit out of a hat" and qualified.
Dutil Minister had in turn appealed to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the standing question, future unit.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he was content to affirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public inquiry.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more the people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee, the resignation of Jean Charest," said his part, said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (state university to form a senior civil servant).
To break this impasse, he proposes that the Quebec to give control of the audit, a special mandate, so that they can do about corruption and collusion investigate.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he decided.
He also represents the view that the Quebec give the control test the same authority as commissioners could, which would also allow her to commit the people to give evidence.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also call on Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so as to be more sensitive to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the chief prosecutor of the operation Marteau, the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law in this kind of law enforcement is not unique.
Vic Toews, Minister of Public Security confirmed in turn by his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson put, is currently with certain amendments concerning this matter apart.
During the operation, Printemps 2001, which concerned the group of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law was not amended.
Ottawa has prevailed as a result, the law against racketeering.

Dupont rebuked some
The Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont before the Canadian Board for broadcast standards (CCNR) suffered because of his controversial remarks about welfare and Haitians as well as because of his abusive speech via radio a partial setback.
The CCNR is of the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had indeed the right to their own opinion, but we could have some comments "inaccurate information about the welfare and unjustified negative portrayals of Haitians, and also contain such a rude way of speaking, the day time program is not appropriate. "
The Board had also inferenced that a discussion about suicide, the spread includes the names of two persons who have committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.

"The majority of the Board considered that the question related episodes of the program" Dupont le midi "a sensitive issue in family-friendly and appropriate manner would have raised."
Therefore, he was charged with no reproach against his person.
The last issue concerned the statements that had been referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had in this respect provided a media-effective dispute that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-host had declared that they have not donated for the benefit of Haiti help, because you certainly do not know whether those who need it actually get the cash donations were received.
The Board is of the opinion that these comments were not improper character, but that their cumulative effect is a present unjustified negative portrayal of Haitians.
"I've already lost my three-day Suspendierungsstrafe in this matter."
"My virgin Act since one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions of the Supervisory Board to denounce the spread of a boorish language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer had acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station that once had including his decisions during prime time during a period of three days to leave, are negligible.

"Currently I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from each category were invited who had placed at the last World Cup in the top four."

"In 2005 I became eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I am come third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rate I will this time or next year will be first!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are from China dating events in which punches and kicks are allowed, as well as ground litter.
The battles usually play on a platform that rare place in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer, who has emerged from this type of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who in the world of martial arts is well known.

450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has agreed by mutual agreement of project planning company 450 million U.S. dollars in contracts for the hydropower project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium comprising the companies BPR, Dessau, SM and Groupe Axor, the most important part, that of project management, has received a total of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" in 2004 to answer as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Quebec, the private sector, their responsibility, that important hydroelectric project in the amount of a sum of $ 5 billion, is formed.
In early 2005 landed the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there was a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the recourse is to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem, evoking the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a conspiracy and exhausted the competition."
"This means that instead of carrying out prearranged games instead of a secret way now in open form," said Sylvain Simard yesterday, deputy of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how the interest of the public in this way can be operated.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau the afternoon had responded by vehemently contest that it had been in this contract is a put-up job.
"I remain faithful to my line," she thundered, encouraged by the PQ was "dishonest" basis and "their lack of hardness.
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is the world standard practice.
It is usually a time such temporary alliance that allows two or more entities to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The "East Main" has a high level of complexity with respect to his employment proportions.
The construction process is underway and should be installed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition had to take place, it had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium is in Quebec even with relatively simple projects no longer an exception and
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted that in the field of civil engineering and consulting model being used by the consortium subject of government investigations.
A short flight over the Quebec business registry makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, the firm Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, which include CIMA +, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, or Roche and Tecsult together.
Any link, and there are several dozen leads back to one and the same entity, namely, Dessau.
What the consortium "Énergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subjected to a specific labor market dynamics and that Hydro-Québec, this fact since the 70's in a special way bill unpaid.
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose can turn up on the fact that the contract was approved by the project management agreement.
"If you make a call and there are few candidates, your prices will soar."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on the Mart and say to yourself. We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price"
"The idea is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," insisted Laporte.
This, the consortium's Énergie gérance "approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 received from the Parti Québécois dollars.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After reviewing counted the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, the firms or their subsidiaries, including, in particular resources, laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had gathered 22 contracts per se, Genivar had received 16, 14 and Dessau Tecsult 10, without whose participation in this counted "Énergie gérance.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They amount to a total of $ 449,783,344, it included the contract with Energy gérance "of $ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had made it known that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe Axor and SM) are the "Parti du Québec Libéral well known.
Minister Normandeau had had hinted, the PQ was similarly connected with the companies that they are "funded," specified before, that it was contrary to their executives.
Barometer verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not reassuring
Green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumers have little confidence among the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither to the designated brands or the eco-labels that are to control his choice.
Too bad, though it bathes in a media-universe, where information in favor of a more responsible use teeming: the barometer of responsible consumption has suffered a lack of credible information, a deficiency that makes itself recognizable as a brake of his commitment as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the use of the so-called socially responsible products in 2010, it seems that Quebecers still those who try to sell them to pay little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebec population is, in fact, give the environmental commitment of the company to as little faith as a green business advertising, tells the consumer the responsible center of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated meter.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the credibility of the official, the alleged fair products attached certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, so the barometer.
Following the same pattern of discourse of the politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of Quebec's population is taken seriously.
The information regarding responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this consumer segment that is currently approaching one-third of Quebec consumers animated.
In fact dampened void and of dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of the consumers.
This is in accordance with the higher price of the products, the second part of the barometer identified brake.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers of the specified performance of green products and services to them is to create hand ready to with mistrust.
According to another communication had changed more than half of consumers in 2010 and changed their habits mainly the mark of one or more products to declare their conviction.
According barometer, they had also preferred to 61% of their purchases from distributors district and encourages the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had achieved this year 64 of the maximum value of 100 - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, is trying his to slow down in the environment traces left by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness nevertheless appears in front of his car to make a stop, the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have indicated, in 2010 used public transportation or carpool prefers to have to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The walking and riding a bicycle were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was approved by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle asked to contribute financially to the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris declared their agreement to cooperate, but only through a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle that a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take on the Daniel Langlois owned cinema complex had eXcentris hopes on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, at this again to answer his true cinematic feature will not appear what they have requested.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but to their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers rather a loan in less than initially expected amount that could get a viable solution with competitive conditions in life, at least in the opinion of the removable from the state's rumor mill sources.
An initial action plan and a request on 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition was again revised since the sum terms down.
A proposal along with an action plan have already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister of St-Pierre, who heads the Act eXcentris.
Several days ago he had let her get a final substantive report.
The counter-proposal of the Cabinet was submitted on Wednesday but the SODEC.
Parallel and Angus have until 31 December in which to respond to this.
In any case, the premise seems to have been the state donation pushed real guidance.
Let us recall to mind that the Quebec community of owners of movie theaters and cinema complexes located had eXcentris rebelled against a direct government investment to support the acquisition of, by asserting the argument that the education minister was not to provide any financial assistance for real estate projects there, he also other cinema halls have to send.
Several other market participants complained of the segment but on the contrary, substantial, economic assistance one.
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed construction of the cinema for ten years with great difficulty, the author presents the premises of his movie theater complex, which could justify the exceptional status by the State.
The lack of movie theaters that show independent films, is in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew his clientele to keep them working.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle Christian Yaccarini at the top to control their part of a privately financed campaign, which they hope to gain a total $ 700,000 to bring in more.
Since the spring of 2009 only runs a single screen proceeds to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of future purchasers is to the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the opening demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois' Des hommes et des dieux "too new.
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper "Le Devoir" has not recalled and they ignored what he and his group from the downwardly revised budget proposals, which have been made to them.
Mystery of the complex-ridden Canada released
The new American diplomatic cables that were distributed by WikiLeaks unravel the mystery of what regard the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, they set but with the same stroke, the feeling of superiority open the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats were surprised that the Canadian voters in the ballot does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to push through their budget by 2009!
The four new releases from the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were disclosed to the public yesterday, offer even more piquant details as the mere substantive content to which you have to nibble.
One of 22 September 2008 dating connection, ie the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing located reported on participation at what point the United Nations, not the political leaders are discussing their missions.
To the surprise of David Wilkins, of Ottawa set up, American ambassador.
Mr. Wilkins offers several possible explanations of this situation.
"Causes a Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex reasons be talking to the Canadian, political leaders much more likely to over internal disputes of everyday life, as blaming the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988 when the campaign to free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the proverbial Goliath this choice: omnipresent, but potentially dangerous to speak of him."
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" even less so as the two countries cherish intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "should inhibit the ability of a candidate, party and much more of a party leader are essential for guiding such a relationship to the voters at the polls as a key factor in mind."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the 22 to prepare January 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa, sent message to President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence from the federal budget in early February, enter in the Canada its first deficit in more than a decade known that due to a recovery program in the height of 30 to 40 billion U.S. dollars has emerged, "says Breese.
He never had mentioned that the Government had the legislative session must adjourn before Christmas to ensure that Parliament would be overthrown by the coalition and affect the so-induced persistence of the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery program would.
Another, dating from January 2008 and by the Ambassador Wilkins agreed written notice from Washington spread becoming increasingly negative image that aired on CBC dramatic series from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O observed in which several subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or transfers for the purpose of by musclemen of CIA interrogations can.
Yet another release detailed reports about how Hillary Clint on her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner asked at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is ready to take some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision.
At the end of the meeting described as "he has delivered to the state secretary a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again.
Finally, we note yet that things get heated with regard to the WikiLeaks Web site.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely consultant with Stephen Harper had said on CBC that should be the massive leak responsible for this "killed."
He had a lecture here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN yesterday proposed a plan in Cancun for the renewal of the lighting of households, commerce and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of the greenhouse gas (CFC), which nearly a third of the additional reduction is equivalent to be recovered in order to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes up its position in the steps of the concrete projects, which hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory emissions reduction commitments by developed countries.
After yesterday put forward a plan would the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the avoided because of the lighting on the earth emitted CFCs, when the incandescent bulbs, which represent so far a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market by fluorescent or better yet, would be replaced by light emitting diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of smoke from the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, had last year, the major gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, also including Canada is obliged to voluntary reduction plans that would scale down the global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From that review we would have to deduct another 5 Gt to stabilize between now and 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs to reduce this energy requirement by a further two times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those required by the manufacturer Philips has launched this week on the market - this company has incidentally participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy consume 25,000 hours and 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the potential savings of Auswechselungsplanes that is to be used in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that hese completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rheostat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that reserves have compact fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and that they therefore dispose of as special needs, which is in the developing countries is not always possible, unless the producers provide a collection point for disposal.
The main source of mercury emissions to the planet, according to the report is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but the coal plants that emit much more mercury to produce the wasted by incandescent bulbs electricity.
Just in the United States experience these coal plants 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report presents a detailed account of the profits that would generate each country thanks to this international program.
Indonesia would save, for instance a billion dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 means a coal-fired power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast awaits excited the announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the "immediate" publication has called for the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast immediately after the deadline.

Gbagbo's camp expects but with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes on the north by the Constitutional Council, nouvelles by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces (FN) were obtained during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign, the Ivory Coast had confirmed that the maneuver was practiced by the FN to deter intimidation of voters in the north of the country, supporters of the president to go to the polls.
The whole election could be canceled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo be considered by the Constitutional Council.
The opponents, however, Gbagbo is now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country was not neutral because he N'Dré Paul Yao, one is led politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north of any connection to the ex-rebels deny, has evaluated the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and Gbagbo asked to respect this, even if he did not go so far as to claim the victory .
reaffirm its alliance Parter, Gbagbo blocking the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost, and lodge a complaint before the Constitutional Court after they had stopped the Election Commission from publishing the results seie illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday were held for the coronation of the association and reconciliation process of a country that was split in two parts over the years.
The United Nations had on Wednesday the leaders of Ivory Coast warned that it could be in the event of possible riots held responsible for this.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bedi (25% in the first round), marketed as a leading candidate behind.

Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysee Palace is exaggerating his role as mediator for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, held the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying," the French public in suspense, the diplomats said on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States.
By WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper "Le Monde" by American seen documents provide some background cheap this crisis.
They describe how the Americans had the Elysée explained his strategy that went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of hostage-taking in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a French captive and the American justice on the basis of trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program sought Iranian Gege to have power.
Finally, they share the way, has tried with the French Presidency to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea plausible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a bright light.
In truth he had not done anything in this regard.
A on 12 August 2009, edited in Paris diplomatic telegram, entitled "Iran: French comments on ways of dealing with hostage-taking."
François Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic matters, talked accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her the French method.
Who advised the Americans to do their utmost to carry back their own nationals who were being held by force in Iran.
"Make Noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights," "Innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime at a loss, which respects very sensitive to its image.
"Runs all the more so since you ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "silence solves nothing, past experiments on the discussion on understated way, the Iranians are" masters in evasive maneuvers. "
Mr. Richier added that the detention of aliens "current, Iranian tactics" was "hostage-taking for purposes of political blackmail."
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come about on August 16, the day on which it takes refuge in the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 € deposit).
And he can announce the Elysée anticipate further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could be "in the near future for another of the arrest about 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released twelve days ago from prison, but is still being held in Iran.
An information was put into circulation: the Iranians Kakavand Majid, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran asking for is a decision of a judge in Paris has been released from prison.
The U.S. Embassy is located, like many other observers, troubling questions about this coincidence.
For Washington, that tracks the illicit Iranian acquisition of the Network for the nuclear program provided material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news dar.
France has made a deal to purchase?
The liberation of the Iranians against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "totally surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to rebel against.
"It has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can not change the court decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier would like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisers dials a phone number, hangs up, then informed the U.S. diplomat, the Iranians "JURISDICTION is currently in the lead by the Iranian embassy building in Paris."
While in detention in Iran by Clotilde Reiss protects the Elysée not his efforts to make believe by the media and statements by organized "escapes" the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play an "important" and "influential mediator.
The Americans observe this activity is not without irony, and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 telegram dating conjures "the flash media of the French authorities" up.
On what is so much "thanksgiving" to Mr Assad, asks the Paris embassy.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities to secretly that they have only a vague idea of ​​what the Syrians did in fact."
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée have caused to expire this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he says.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved "then.
"The Syrian role based predominantly" try Paris' Syria to keep in mind you can achieve what Commendation by playing a constructive role in the region. "
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran of sowing."
The American Embassy know this from a good source.
On 11 August François Richier had told her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have always done whatever."
"But we are nevertheless grateful to them."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 in France is back.
Nicolas Sarkozy she receives at the Elysee.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role for the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is called a law, "the Cinderella" to adopt, which will prohibit young people to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, then indicated to government officials.
A bill, which the online game operator should encourage, young people under 16 years to deny after midnight to access these games will be submitted to Parliament in December, marked Representatives of worship and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with the bill Ministerialbeauftragter entrusted by the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online games were then re-open from 6 am clock.
The manufacturers companies had one year time to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The Governments of the eye as well to ask manufacturers to scale down the day to access these games time limit granted to those young people to ask their parents to, "added the manager.
He will ask those same people who want it, free programs available that make it possible to limit the time spent on the internet time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won over 58 new countries four gold medals in the World Cyber ​​Games.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appointed by the host country
In a state of panic because of corruption allegations, the Executive Committee of FIFA on Thursday appointed the host countries of the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political election in which threaten to push the jockeying for influence and lobbying the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: the output of 2018, the pinnacle of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 countries: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition 2022 will be somewhat exotic, the International Football Association hopes to win after the first night on the African continent in 2010, new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself or its subsidiary in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea to follow) on.
The list of personalities who have to delegate a part (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) the level of economic and political use of a World Cup before.
The machinations behind the scenes so threatening to the last minute to stop.
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report the FIFA, which offer English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) Act in improving ways of arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations are not for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the hour of election are so important.
The Sunday Times, that the attainment of the suspension was two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations would have as good chances for their own country, the cradle of football to ruin, that only once the was allowed to deliver World Cup, namely 1966th
The BBC had been the breeding ground again on Monday, was broadcast by a documentary, the three influential members of the committee, namely, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire.
Reason enough to anger, FIFA and the English to bring those responsible at a loss, which had primarily operated with David Cameron in the last few weeks an intensive lobbying.
The Prime Minister hopes for a new edition of the successful by his predecessor Tony Blair Chess train, which had achieved in 2005 for the organization of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
If this intensive use are sufficient to enhance the image of England before the committee again?
Nothing is less certain, since the duo Spain-Portugal, there is no lack of length with his already completed stages of his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, ​​Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial drawbacks of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as concerns about solvency of Spain and Portugal have the chance of Russia, the increase in spite of its deficiencies in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transportation) has become an overweight outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the candid suggestion denounced the accusations of the British press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Committee members.
"They pelted with mud, trying to compromise it," Putin railed.
For 2022 seem to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea exhibit, which have set up separately a very nice project.
But these candidates seem premature for two countries that had helped organize the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the long-awaited approval from the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, which will make the Asian opportunities to 2022 fell.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops in waiting futuristic stadiums, FIFA keeps its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries are at higher risk for certainty dar.
Australia could suffer as well as Japan and South Korea under the akquittierten weakness of the European countries of the TV rights (due to the time difference), the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the clear
De Gaulle had actually trimmed.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stop short.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée summons for the next.
The current head of state is ergo his candidate in 2012.
But obviousness is the site of the mystery that clings to the presidential function, not to shame.
So do you have as if the doubt would henceforth.
In one, as in other senses.
2006 revealed before the followers of Jacques Chirac, a third term was not impossible, without even believing it.
On 15 November Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone, his decision to "sometime in the fall of 2011.
That he would leave on Tuesday evening at the Elysee before the UMP parliamentarians, the prospect of "two mandates," which suggests, had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President had merely pointed out that the constitutional amendment in 2008 limiting the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not a warning.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election at such meeting in a humorous tone.
"You have the worst case, seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Do not think that I do not think about the phase then."
His words of yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the previous day, but no less.
If they provoke comments, then twice for a reason.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination with the PS on a page.
It is not the host of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, desperate to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is obvious his candidacy in 2012, exhorting the many members of the PS early adopted as the declaration of war.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time the voters of the right hand the nomination of François Fillon, Mr Sarkozy would prefer the (46% vs. 44%, according to the survey of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully, the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he is a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," announced Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppe, who is resigned to the obviousness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep their purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Central Council of the ECB in the past year should be an opportunity to show possibilities how to get out of the crisis, or at least the arrangement of a large number of non-conventional measures of monetary policy announcements, to the end of the year coming to a close.
The crisis of European government debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt, it can not afford without a doubt, even today, more to forfeit a tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political cost of this would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday at a press conference by the ECB welcomes the occupied and active role in favor of solving the state budget debt in Europe.
She has not dared to say whether it was thought that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasoning for my European partners (...) ."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels to mark not his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament very eloquently about shown its projects, but rather is content to point out that the program of purchases of government securities on the secondary market, "continue to operate" and that we would "be seen as failure, the decisions" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: The ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest levels since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases by the Treasury by the ECB last week at about 1.35 billion euros have been doubled.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers yesterday it is to new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds have made.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks since May 2010 purchases of 67 billion euros have made.
Among the brands the anticipation of a follow-up of purchase price is not in doubt (see page 29).
Economists expect no remarkable change of course has more.
If the bond transactions will be gone more than three months, from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter will create yet make the full resources of bountiful nature reserves, and over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already becoming prepared to find that this measure will still expand by a few months.
"I can not imagine that the ECB will amend its program to essential nature."
"Otherwise, they would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert suspects, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A appears in the course of first quarter of 2011 provided, progressive phasing me more probable," anticipates its part Norbert Braem, an economist at Sal
Oppenheim.
In the area of ​​its intervention on the performance of government debt, "the ECB should keep up such a volume of purchases of bonds, which revived the sluggish market," adds Norbert Braem.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the market for government debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence in the market.
"You must enter at any price, in the place of the lack of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," testified yesterday a major bond holders.
Because when interest rates start to soar, the states would have prevented more to reduce their debt or to stabilize only.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy goes under cover
After a troubling start of the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed yesterday with the decrease in base for 10 years a little.
A return to the deceptive calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, Giulio Tremonti, had the region chairman of the situation as "indecipherable" and qualify it with an "unpredictable" weekend, expect to hear what the person in question but denied immediately.
On Tuesday at least the gap with German interest rates would have achieved his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts covering the bankruptcy risk had increased to 263 points, which had caused a certain amount of stupidity in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi during his Ministers noted that the discrepancy of Spain into the German interest rates to 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed, however, as "serious concern" about the "turmoil" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro zone, not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy and Portugal," Irwin Stelzer, an economist said at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, consumptive control inputs, which bring the country in danger, no longer cover its financing needs.
The Brussels last forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012 is expected ... although this adds to the Senate for consideration this budget, budget of 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, they calculated the EU Commission, the budget deficit next year, still account for 4.3% of GDP (against the forecast by the Governments of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar caused by a new collective budget that could be used after the holidays to a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new measures are applied," said auditor Olli Rehn.
For the hour available to Italy to support international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are controlled in order and his accounts, which we repeat for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is entrusted with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, either on short-term nor long-term view, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) lower stabilization progress will be required as other countries "observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Respect to the issue of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is facing a motion of censure of the House of Representatives, as a result of which the preferred end of March elections could be organized.
It is therefore a less favorable period before a decision regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anti-crisis measures for
Christine Lagarde had only yesterday highlighted at a press conference in Paris explicitly: "I think we proved it even on Sunday afternoon and the evening, the Europeans stick together clearly are willing and committed to defend their currency as well as their area" .
Although entirely relative - who yesterday showed off at the feet of European government bonds interest rate was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
From a start of normalization may not yet be said.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had declared that they could note the debt of Portugal, which reduce most effective target for speculators today.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, which weighs particularly on the banking system," the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, since "political time passes much slower than those of the markets."
The European countries that strengthen both the gap and the danger that lies therein, are well aware of the discussions to reinforce the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance and more generally with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing.
And this in terms of the meetings of Ecofin € Groupe and early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan the lot of unconventional measures is aimed at stiffening the euro-zone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for starting the EU Stability Fund, then the Executive Director Klaus Regling on Tuesday in Singapour his Asian tour to inform the investors in the Far East on the developments concerning the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit, although not explicit fundraising, so he prepares this to the terrain.
The first Werpapierausgaben by the EU Stability Fund is for next month.
Yesterday an official representative of the American agency had told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the mobilized by the additional direct involvement of the IMF funds.
Portugal and Spain, countries in the first place to send on their part, structural reforms, particularly in the area to take over the labor organization.
Reforms which are additional to the savings measures, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid tread a different path than did Greece and Ireland.
Both the one, and the other is at any price to avoid it, having to ask for international assistance before they have established their own Budgetkorrektive inevitable and decided on structural reforms, which brings them back in the long run the trust.
The European investor in turn talk about the available options to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who on 24 November's transit was in Paris, had produced the first idea that if the 750 in Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion € were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to again reach into their own pockets.
The economists at Barclays Capital in respect of the market for European government debt in the foreground standing player, judge, an extension of around 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This product exists: the European mechanism doped financial stabilization, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
to an advisory board that has every chance to be examined closely in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions worsen.

Grand Metropole Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France in full swing, it's raining billion.
At least in the discussions.
We are especially aware call the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To manage the construction of the SGP in the ways the state has declared a capital endowment of 4 billion €.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount that would then allow the SGP, to give the markets a part of the financial sum to her twice.
Today it has finally come to the first projections.
The supplementary budget of 2010, this morning reviewed by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, includes the measures envisaged in order to apply the first part of this money.
This is take two measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile de France.
Former, it can be seen in Article 15 of the draft law goes, "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Second, a reorganization of existing business taxation "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and respond to this increase in the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would earn it?
A mystery.
This amount is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion we are far away.
"It is stated that fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation, which are applied by the state and the Société du Grand Paris gradually done for the project," said the explanatory statement refer to.
In the SGP will find this system is not offensive.
"Since the moment in which we recorded revenue (the two taxes, typically), one can cover the project over three years, and only then draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is listed in the budget and deducted by and by."
The SGP is estimated that 2013 will be started to write down 4 billion for the budget 2014th
This measure, whose 4 billion promised you will long to search is in danger, a very moving, causing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting on 7 December.
Vindictive hackers and diligent spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a dual meaning.
On one hand, it has turned out to be obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces far-reaching changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But we proceed in order to.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each created by a secret file (an x-any nation) is composed entirely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" revelations about the sexual habits of American Berlusconi's throw from nothing more than what we got for months anyway-any x in each journal to read (other than those owned by Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte Profile Gaddafi offered cabaret artists for a long time material for their skits.
The rule that must pass the secret dossiers of known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each plant (of the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeats what is already written in previous works was.
This is not just the fact that the author of occult texts will not publish research (nor, therefore, that he did not know where to find news would be of the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to the occult, of anything else, as believe what they already know or confirm what they have already learned.
This mechanism is also the success of Dan Brown.
Similarly, the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is the head of the secret (otherwise, what could also be, for example, an editor at Libération), which is only considered as true, as he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, who had the American Embassy in Rome sent the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier was made?
On one side, say it, knows what every educated person already, namely that the messages - may take at least since the Second World War and since then the Government can call each other or a plane to meet up for dinner - their diplomatic function have lost and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, into espionage centers.
Any viewers of investigative films knows this very well and it does not happen from hypocrisy that we're supposed to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it in public, violates the object of the hypocrisy and serves to inform the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: The idea that an x-secret secrets of any hacker can tap into the most powerful country in the world, the significant blow against the prestige of the State bears department.
Moreover, the scandal does not so much the victims, but rather the "executioner" in distress.
But we are dedicated to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's time, you could combine all the power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy had since been able to turn out to be completely right, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, they make a transaction, the hotel visited, the elected highway and so on, the citizens would be the total victims of the eye of power.
But if you have in mind would lead what is happening today is that even the secret crypts of power can not escape the control of a hacker, so, the control gear to be addressed on one side and circular ground.
The power control every citizen, but any citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience.
How can but hold a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets?
It is true, (and be an empty secret can never be revealed) Georg Simmel said, that a real mystery is an empty secret, it is also true that any knowledge is about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it reveals the public sphere, but in the style of WikiLeaks disclose that were the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, however, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult, which such an enormous power was added?
It is obvious that the states in the future no longer be reserved, please ask yourself - this one would come up to the street corner glued posting.
But it is also clear that with the current technology is vain to hope to be able to keep secret confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a president travels in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
What could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and novel-like sounds, but I find myself compelled to imagine the government agent, is a secret way busily moving to uncontrollable roadmaps, their messages anywhere other than in the mere memory carrying with it, and moreover, the few written information they have received, in the heel hiding.
The information would be stored in single copy in locked drawers in fact had the espionage trial of Watergate reported less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is advancing these days like a cancer, that is backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communications, reconstructs the Internet with a telegraph (telephone) wire.
was the (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers, a film scout band for band by back to front coil and all the secrets of mounting air, while allowing the (numerical) CDs now nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter , ie, in macro portions.
With the high speed trains you drive within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half by plane, including the interchanges hours.
It is therefore not unusual that return policy and communication technology on car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forged in secret between the messages.
Currently, there are the messages that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: nice as France persuaded its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to ensure compliance with the rapidly dissolved funding promise (also called "Fast Start" or early financing ") to investigate, which were realized by developing countries.
And even the French crude Beautiful shipping companies are revealed.
The Copenhagen agreement, developing countries have pledged to mobilize 30 billions dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (ie 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled all the stops to their partners on the fact of their commitment to satisfy the fast-start lending: How detailed report of its Member States to press, great side events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is admirable and appreciated just for their intrinsic value: the developing countries and civil society would see it like if all the developed countries did the same on the same level of precision.
The EU announced that they have released in 2010, 2.2 billion euros, which puts them on track to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if one looks into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional application was submitted without redound to the detriment of official development assistance according to the Copenhagen agreement.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional."
While the EU Commission proposed a harmonization of certain member states, including France, have blocked the process.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he deemed best.
The EU Commission has chosen, for example as a guide for those of 2009: the international finance are maintained and are in the financing of "fast start" over three years to 150 million.
Other countries have similar values, either with regard to year or with respect to selected conditions at the level of official development assistance.
In return, France was considered that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional."
In other words, there are no guidelines for expenditure of the previous year, or global levels of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to respect its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
In yet there is no rule, and each elects its calculation mode.
Some, such as France are, 1 borrowed € to be equivalent to € 1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to argue: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is wrong to introduce the euro, the one recognized as the equivalent of a donated € ... Moreover, only the costs, should the loan for the investor country are counted as a commitment (ie the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing different in meaning as the following consideration: it "respects" his commitment of 420 million euros, by 91.5% Loans (€ 389.8 million) receives and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document, in order to witness.
France is the only EU country that uses loan to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while pursuing Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) their obligations to 100% of donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 € to fulfill their obligations outputs are France just 10 cents and understands a similar use.
Beautiful Hoax!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: to part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make believe that it had issued 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with his promise, saving 36.1 million €.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it probably seems that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect by itself, once the EU internally (why go the other member states continue with the donation if it is enough to but ? borrow) and then in the negotiations, as developing countries can be fooled so completely ...
The chapter of the premature funding only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the total in discussions on the climate.
But it might be too much of the drop in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the reason is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of France could announce a change in its Verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the corrective justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France would bring the discussions on the subject-matter of the long-term financing to the front (another crucial and currently debated topic): you can not escape the question of "chargeability" or Verbuchungsart its loans.
France could change its position to be well advanced with regard to the issues, as it is in other things.
The hope rests on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprise announcement about the Fast-Start of France and its vision of "chargeability" and the use of loans would increase by nature, the international trust that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years, takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Protection of the rights and respect of future generations) published study.
The association, which declared that their results "reflect the face of the small number of samples analyzed, no statistically significant value, but represent Illustration character of the treated problem, had between July and September, usually within four, one about ten years old child at meals consumption of foods plus a snack in the supermarkets in Paris and bought Oise.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as treats from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance plate is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 as possibly or probably cause cancer and five classified as safe karziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-disruptive, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if not exceeded in the virtually all the cases, the legal limit for any chemical, individually ingested substance, one of the survey takes it very well that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-causing agents or substances with Endokrinin-disruptive is worrying, "says the association.
Already at breakfast alone contain butter and tea with milk, more than ten of the potentially cancer-causing residues and three safe proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide banned in the EU has strict.
Furthermore, were the hamburger steak, the tuna from the can, even peppered the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water, the analysis, the presence of nitrates and chloroform have brought to light.
When dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues in the "richest" and even that was not to warm up the meal in the microwave used plastic plates unloaded.
The eventual risk of this "pollutant cocktails" for the consumer "is probably undervalued," says the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has also proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in lifestyle diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues of 365 different, identified in fruit and vegetable pesticides identified, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
